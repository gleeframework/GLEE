"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will pay off for you in the long run. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is looking to save money and $15,000 is above his maximum price.  He'll reject the offer and see if he can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price.  How about $10,000? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10000 is a fair price, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to get a better price. $12,000 is closer to his budget, but he can still try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable with $11,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
