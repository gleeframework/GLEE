"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will pay off for you in the long run. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price.  How about $10000? ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10000 is a fair price, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable with $11000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
