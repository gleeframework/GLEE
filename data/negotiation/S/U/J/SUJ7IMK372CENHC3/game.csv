"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you're willing to make an offer. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with another seller. ",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,320,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Let me see if we can meet in the middle again.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
