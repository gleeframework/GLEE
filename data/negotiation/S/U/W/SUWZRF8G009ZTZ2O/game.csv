"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is a significant amount for me.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my final offer, as I have another option available for $8,000. Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $10,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
