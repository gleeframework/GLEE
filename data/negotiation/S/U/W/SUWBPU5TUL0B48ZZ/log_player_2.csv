"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $9,500. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a bit high. There's room for negotiation to try and get a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with an offer closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that I'm looking for a significant discount.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is framed politely to keep the negotiation amicable, but also clearly states that the initial price is not acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product at a price of $9,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we're not there yet.  She's conceded a bit, so now it's time to show I'm also willing to be flexible, but I'll still aim for a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $8,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 8750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:** I'm moving up in smaller increments now ($250), showing willingness to negotiate but still pushing for a lower price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** $8,750 represents a compromise where Alice is still getting a decent profit, and I'm saving a significant amount compared to John's offer. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:** The tone remains positive and collaborative to encourage a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer you the product at a price of $9,200. It's a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further haggling might only result in small concessions from Alice.  $9,200 is a decent price, and it's likely close to her final offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and potential frustration. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable saving compared to John's offer ($2,800 cheaper).
* **Relationship:** Ending the negotiation amicably can be beneficial for future interactions, should they arise."
