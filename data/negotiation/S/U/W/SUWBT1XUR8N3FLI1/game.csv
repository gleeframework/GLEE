"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $775,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, and for meeting me halfway. While I agree the product is good, $775,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Could we settle somewhere around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $750,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you at $725,000, but that's as low as I can go.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $725,000 is getting closer, but to be honest, my absolute limit is $710,000.  If you can do that, I'm ready to close the deal.",710000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $725,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $720,000. This is the best I can do.",720000.0,Alice,7,
