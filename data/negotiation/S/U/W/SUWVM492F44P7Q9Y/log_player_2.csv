"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you leave open the possibility of her offering a lower price, allowing you to save more."
