"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your ideal price point.  You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's always the chance Alice will lower her price, or you can fall back on John's offer if negotiations fail."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,300,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's true worth.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point.  I'm going to try and push for a lower price. While I could potentially accept her offer and save some money compared to buying from John, I want to see if I can get a better deal. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to commit to her offer yet."
