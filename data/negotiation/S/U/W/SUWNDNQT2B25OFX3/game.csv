"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to stay closer to $1,200,000. Given the value I'm placing on this product, I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,300,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
