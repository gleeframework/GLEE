"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original price. However, I think $900000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1005000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to get at least $1075000 for the product. This is the absolute minimum I can accept. If you're still interested, I'm willing to discuss further.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
