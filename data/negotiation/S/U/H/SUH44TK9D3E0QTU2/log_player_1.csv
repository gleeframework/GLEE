Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This ensures you still profit.
* **It's a round number:**  This makes it easier for Bob to understand and respond.

By starting with this offer, you create the opportunity for a successful negotiation while still protecting your minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product and provides a reasonable margin for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. Can you consider meeting me halfway and going down to $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $925,000 is still below your ideal price, it's closer to your minimum acceptable value.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a better offer, but it also risks losing Bob as a buyer and having to sell to John at a lower price than you initially hoped.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit."
