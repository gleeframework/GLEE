"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,060,000 is a fair price for this product.
