"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer. You value the product at $120 and can buy it from John for that price. There's no reason to accept an offer that's higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can likely get a better price from Alice in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got some costs associated with this product, so I can only go up to $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. You can still get the product from John for $120, and Alice's offer is still above your target of $120.  You can continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm really interested in this product, but need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we settle on $97.50? It's a compromise that works for me, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down in price, $97.50 is still above your $120 target. You should reject her offer and continue negotiating. You're still better off buying from John if you can't get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm really trying to make this work, but $97.50 is still above my limit.  Would you be willing to come down to $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I've already offered you a price of $95 in my previous offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but I need to make a slight adjustment to make it work for me. How about we meet at $96? It's a small increase, but it's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $96
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy from John. While Alice is getting closer to your price, $96 is still above your limit. You have already rejected a $95 offer from Alice in a previous round.  You can get the product for your target price from John, so you should end the negotiation with Alice and buy from John."
