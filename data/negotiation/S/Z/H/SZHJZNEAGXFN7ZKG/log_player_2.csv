"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. My asking price is $140, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. Starting significantly lower than our maximum budget ($150) gives us space to haggle and potentially secure a much better deal. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer gauges Alice's willingness to move on price. Her response will give us valuable information about her flexibility in the next round.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is cordial but clearly states our position. We want Alice to understand we are serious about the purchase but need a more competitive price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:**  Alice reducing her price to $130 is a good sign, indicating she's open to negotiation. 
* **Room for Improvement:** While closer to our ideal price, $130 is still above what we're aiming for. We can likely negotiate further. 
* **Limited Risk:** We are still early in the negotiation process. Rejecting this offer poses minimal risk, and we have ample time to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $120? It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** By suggesting to ""split the difference,"" we present a solution that seems fair and mutually beneficial. This can make Alice more receptive to our offer.
* **Target Price:** We are now at our target price of $120. While we might be able to negotiate a few dollars lower, it's unlikely given Alice's previous responses.  
* **Time Consideration:** We are four rounds in.  While we have time, it's wise to aim for a deal soon, in case the negotiation stalls."
