Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,200,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification for Value:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, encouraging Bob to consider its potential benefits. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The question at the end invites Bob to engage in the conversation, even if he finds the initial price high.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John. If Bob knows your bottom line, this approach could backfire."
