"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation at $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm a bit concerned about the price, and I'd like to see some wiggle room for negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you a price of $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a new offer of $950000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit hesitant about the price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $1150000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of your last two offers, so I'll make a new offer of $1050000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm afraid $1050000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $1100000. I can offer you a price of $1200000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my minimum requirements. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to considering buying from John. I'll make a new offer of $1080000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you can meet me here.",1080000.0,Bob,8,
