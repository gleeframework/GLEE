"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Considering its inherent value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for countering.  While I'm motivated to sell, $1,100,000 undervalues its potential.  Would you consider $1,300,000? I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer on the price.  I'm ready to do business, but  $1,300,000 is still a bit much. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
