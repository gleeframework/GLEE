Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong but Respectful Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and frames the price as a fair proposal rather than a hardline stance.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging his potential for negotiation."
