"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500 for it.  This would still leave you a profit and allows me to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to make a good profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,500.  Let's find a middle ground.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to get the deal done. I'll sell the product to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000.",15500.0,Alice,5,
