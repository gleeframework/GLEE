"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $800000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $750000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $500000 for it.  What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $675000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $675000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $600000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $650000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $625000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",625000.0,Alice,5,
