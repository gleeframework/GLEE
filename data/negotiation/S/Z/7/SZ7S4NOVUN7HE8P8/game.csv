"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $13,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $13,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept it. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more serious offer to try to reach an agreement. I'll come down to $14,500, which is as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",14500.0,Alice,7,
