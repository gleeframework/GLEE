"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my profit. This offer is a starting point, and I'm ready to negotiate down depending on Bob's response.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm hoping to secure a better price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's too low. I believe I can secure a better price. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly but still aiming for a profit. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe the product's worth more than Bob's initial offer.  I'm hoping he'll see the value and come closer to my price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still too low. I'm not going to accept it yet. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price.  I'm not going to sell to John yet as I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. This counteroffer is a compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to try and reach a middle ground. Bob's offer is getting closer, but I still believe the product is worth more than $950,000.  This is my last attempt to negotiate with Bob before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer, but they still don't meet my minimum value. With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a more profitable deal. To guarantee I don't lose out on a significant amount of money, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a safe and secure outcome, ensuring I don't end up with a lower offer from Bob."
