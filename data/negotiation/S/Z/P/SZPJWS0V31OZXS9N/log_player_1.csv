Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $100, so offering it below that price is pointless.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it slightly below John's price ($140) leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal while still maximizing profit for Alice. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price attractive to Bob and ensuring Alice doesn't lose out on a guaranteed profit."
