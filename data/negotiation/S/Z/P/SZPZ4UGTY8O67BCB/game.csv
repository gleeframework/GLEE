"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a steal if you ask me!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if you're interested!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested!",10200.0,Alice,5,
