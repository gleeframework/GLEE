Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I'm placing on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

We're getting closer, but I'm still leaving money on the table if I accept.  It's worth another counter-offer to see if we can bridge the gap further."
