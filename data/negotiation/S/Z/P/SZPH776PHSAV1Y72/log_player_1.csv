"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always advantageous to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Confident Justification:** By highlighting the product's value and potential, you aim to anchor Bob's perception of the price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my current needs and resources.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $700,000 is substantial, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price and his own valuation of the product.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you believe the product is worth more and are willing to negotiate further. 

We will aim for a counteroffer that bridges the gap while still keeping us above our $800,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position.  However, the value this product brings to the table is undeniable.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This recognizes your interest while reflecting the true worth of what's on offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant concession from $1,000,000 to $900,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Strong:**  The $900,000 price point keeps us well above both our minimum and Bob's valuation, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We continue to reinforce the product's value to justify the price. 

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and it's a price I feel comfortable with. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 exceeds both your minimum price ($800,000) and John's standing offer. It represents a strong outcome and a significant profit margin. Accepting now avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially lowering the final price or reaching an impasse."
