"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my current needs and resources.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position.  However, the value this product brings to the table is undeniable.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This recognizes your interest while reflecting the true worth of what's on offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and it's a price I feel comfortable with. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round.",850000.0,Bob,4,
