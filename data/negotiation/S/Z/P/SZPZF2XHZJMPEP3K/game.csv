,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $16,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle a bit - how about $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $12,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
