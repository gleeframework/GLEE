"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,5,
