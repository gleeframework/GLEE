"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $11000 for it. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $11000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12500.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to move forward if you're willing to accept it.  ",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your final offer of $12500. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",14000.0,Alice,5,
