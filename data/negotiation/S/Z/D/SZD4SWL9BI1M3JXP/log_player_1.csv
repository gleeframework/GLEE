Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase it and you to secure a sale close to your desired price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.
