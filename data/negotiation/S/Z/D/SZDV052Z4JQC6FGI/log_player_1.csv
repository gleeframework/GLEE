Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $80, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation. It also gauges Bob's interest level.  
* **Leaving room for profit:** Offering at $170 aims to maximize profit while staying somewhat reasonable. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay beyond $80.  If you had more information, you could adjust your strategy accordingly."
