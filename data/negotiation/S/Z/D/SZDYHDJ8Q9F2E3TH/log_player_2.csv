"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering your valuation of $1,200,000, I'm willing to make you a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000 for the product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her product valuation, it's still more expensive than John's offer of $1,200,000. You can save a significant amount of money ($200,000) by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
