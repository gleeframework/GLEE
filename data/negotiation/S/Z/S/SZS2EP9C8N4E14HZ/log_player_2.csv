This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice's Final Offer:** She has stated this is her final offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Significant Savings:**  You're getting the product for $280,000 less than John's price.
* **Risk of Pushing Further:**  If you reject and counter, you risk Alice ending negotiations and losing the opportunity for a good deal."
