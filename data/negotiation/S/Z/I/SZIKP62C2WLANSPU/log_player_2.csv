You have three options:

Alice's offer:

Alice is slowly coming down, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer a bit closer to her price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short on my minimum price. How about we go to $8,200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

Alice is clearly trying to get as close to her value as possible. While I could try to push for $8,000, there's a risk she'll reject it and I'll end up with John's offer of $10,000. Accepting $8,200 ensures I get the product at a reasonable discount."
