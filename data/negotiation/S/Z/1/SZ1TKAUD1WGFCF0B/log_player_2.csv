"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  How about $13,000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see if I can do a bit better than that. How about $13,800? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $13,800**, which is a better price than John's $15,000 and closer to Bob's target of saving as much money as possible. 
* **Further negotiation is risky**:  While Bob could try for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and Bob could end up paying John's price.
* **It's better to accept the offer**:  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
