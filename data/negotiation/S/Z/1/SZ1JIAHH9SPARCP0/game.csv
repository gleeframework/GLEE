"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product would be great, $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your budget concerns, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Could you do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
