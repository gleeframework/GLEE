"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That seems fair to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to offer $11,100.  Let me know if that works for you.",11100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm still not quite there. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm starting to think we might be getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're at an impasse. This is my final offer: $11,150. If you can't accept that, I'll have to consider John's offer.",11150.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'll meet you halfway between $11,150 and $11,500, which is $11,325. This is my final offer, and I expect you to accept it.",11325.0,Alice,9,
