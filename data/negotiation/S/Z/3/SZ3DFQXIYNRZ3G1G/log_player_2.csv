"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really enjoy! It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price.  While you could buy from her, you are not gaining any advantage by doing so. You'll get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a better price with her in the future, or to look for other sellers."
