Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm, and while we could push further, the potential savings are getting smaller.  At $915,000, we're getting a decent deal compared to John's $1,000,000 offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks either a stalemate or Alice walking away, leaving us with the less favorable option."
