# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is less than John's price, you know you can get the product for a maximum of $100.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to secure the sale."
