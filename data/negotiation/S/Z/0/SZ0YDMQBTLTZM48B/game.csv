"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $70 for it.",70.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to compromise and offer the product to you for $85. This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
