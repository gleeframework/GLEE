(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly committed to increments around $10,000. At $790,000, we've pushed her down significantly. While we might be able to squeeze out another $10,000, there's a risk she hardens her position and we end up closer to $800,000 or even walking away. Taking the $790,000 secures a very good price."
