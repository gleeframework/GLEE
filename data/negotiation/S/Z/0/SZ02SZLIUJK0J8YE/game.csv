"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? Let me know your thoughts.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $875,000. How about we try $862,500?",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $862,500 is still too low for me. I'm happy to compromise, but I need to stay above $870,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $872,500? Let's meet in the middle.",872500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $871,250. How about we try that?",871250.0,Bob,6,
