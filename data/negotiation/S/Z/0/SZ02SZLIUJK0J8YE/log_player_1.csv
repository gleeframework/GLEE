"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $875,000. How about we try $862,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still closer to my goal of $900,000 and I believe with a bit more negotiation, I can get a price closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $862,500 is still too low for me. I'm happy to compromise, but I need to stay above $870,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $872,500? Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 872500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $871,250. How about we try that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $871,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $871,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $871,250. While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than selling to John and we're close to the end of the negotiations. There's a chance Bob might reject my next counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
