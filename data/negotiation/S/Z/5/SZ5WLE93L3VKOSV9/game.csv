"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could we possibly settle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",9750.0,Bob,4,
