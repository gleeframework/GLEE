{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a decent price, he can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11200. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. He can still negotiate with Alice, and the price of $11,200 is still a bit higher than his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,200 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $10,750?  That's a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $11500. I'm willing to give you a small discount, though. I'll sell it to you for $11400. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money and is getting closer to his desired price point.  While $11,400 is better than the initial offers, he can likely get a better deal with a counteroffer.  There are still several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While I'm getting closer to my target, $11,400 is still a bit too high. Let's meet in the middle at $11,000. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I can move forward with the purchase.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum target, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need a bit more. I'll sell it to you for $11100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** $11,100 is a good price for Bob, considering his goal is to spend less than $12,000.
* **Rounds:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's likely Alice won't budge further.
* **Potential Loss:** If Bob rejects this offer, he risks Alice walking away entirely, forcing him to buy from John at $12,000.

By accepting, Bob secures a decent deal without risking a worse outcome."
