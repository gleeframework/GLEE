"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11200 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $10750?  That's a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the purchase.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While I'm getting closer to my target, $11400 is still a bit too high. Let's meet in the middle at $11000. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I can move forward with the purchase.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,6,
