Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Maximize potential profit:** A higher price means a higher potential profit for me.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Bob might be willing to pay more than $12,000 but less than $15,000.  This allows for negotiation.
* **Safeguard against John's offer:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, I'm still guaranteed to sell the product to John for $12,000, so I'm not taking a significant risk.

Ultimately, the success of this strategy depends on Bob's willingness to pay. If he values the product highly, he might accept the offer. If not, I can always fall back on John's offer."
