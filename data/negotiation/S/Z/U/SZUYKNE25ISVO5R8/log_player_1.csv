"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, just below Bob's perceived value of the product. This creates room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price closer to my desired range.  I'm confident Bob will be willing to negotiate down from this price, as he's still getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is above my minimum value of $10,000, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue negotiating and try to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with a price of $13,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but still leaves some room for potential future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price. $12,000 is closer to my desired range, but I'm confident I can push for a bit more, especially since I have several rounds left.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above $12,000. This shows a willingness to compromise, but also demonstrates that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than my desired value.  I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would ideally prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting close to my minimum acceptable value.  I'm choosing to accept this offer rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John for $10,000. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and closes the deal."
