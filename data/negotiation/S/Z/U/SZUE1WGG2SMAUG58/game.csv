"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth that much in my budget.  I could consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price.  However, $950,000 is still pushing beyond what I can justify. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's as high as I'm able to go at this time.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To meet you closer to your price range, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the true value of this product.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at a lower price point. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need the numbers to make sense. Would you be willing to consider $800,000? That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
