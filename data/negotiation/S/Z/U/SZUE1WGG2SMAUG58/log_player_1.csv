Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth that much in my budget.  I could consider a price closer to $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting compared to losing the sale, it's far too low. We have room to negotiate and Bob's initial offer suggests he's willing to pay a significant amount.  We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $950,000?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price.  However, $950,000 is still pushing beyond what I can justify. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's as high as I'm able to go at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're making progress, but $700,000 is still a significant way off from our minimum. Bob increasing his offer indicates he's willing to negotiate further. Let's counter with a price closer to our minimum, but leaving room for one more round of negotiation if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To meet you closer to your price range, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at a lower price point. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need the numbers to make sense. Would you be willing to consider $800,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has met our minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee we can negotiate him higher, and we risk him taking the other deal.  Accepting $800,000 is the best move at this point."
