```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'd be willing to purchase for $650,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
$650,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $900,000?  That still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $850,000? This is a significant compromise on my end, and it still allows you to make a substantial profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000?  That's a fair price that works well for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
