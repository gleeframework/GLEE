"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'd be willing to purchase for $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $900,000?  That still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $850,000? This is a significant compromise on my end, and it still allows you to make a substantial profit.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000?  That's a fair price that works well for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
