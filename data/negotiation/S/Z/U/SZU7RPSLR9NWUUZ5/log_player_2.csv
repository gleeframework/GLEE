"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than her product's value and leaves little room for negotiation from your perspective.  You should reject the offer and propose a counteroffer significantly lower, aiming to meet somewhere closer to the middle in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'd be willing to purchase for $650,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point that signals your interest while leaving ample room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $900,000?  That still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer has come down, it's still quite far from your target price. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating and see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows you're willing to move closer to Alice's price while still remaining firm on staying below your maximum budget.  The ""meeting in the middle"" framing can also be a persuasive negotiation tactic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $850,000? This is a significant compromise on my end, and it still allows you to make a substantial profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is slowly coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. You're aiming for a price closer to $750,000, so it's worth making one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000?  That's a fair price that works well for both of us."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that's mutually beneficial. By offering to ""split the difference,"" you're demonstrating flexibility while also sticking close to a price point that works for you.  Since Alice values the product at $800,000, there's a good chance she'll accept this offer."
