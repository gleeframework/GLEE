"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $122.50?  That way we both get a fair deal.",122.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $122.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $120? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
