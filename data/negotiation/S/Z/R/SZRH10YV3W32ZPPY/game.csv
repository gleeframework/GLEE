"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12000 to make this deal work.  It's still a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $9000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500? It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy. ",10500.0,Alice,5,
