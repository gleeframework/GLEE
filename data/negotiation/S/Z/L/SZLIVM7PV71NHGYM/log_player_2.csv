While $120 is your maximum, it's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
