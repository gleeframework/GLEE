,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm placing on this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1250000, which reflects a compromise on both our ends.  I believe this price is still fair and represents a significant benefit to you.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit stretched on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1150000. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1150000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm prepared to make one final compromise and offer the product for $1225000. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, and it's a fair price for a product that will undoubtedly be of great value to you.  I believe this is the best we can do to reach an agreement.  Let me know your final decision.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
