"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value and our ability to reach a deal, I aim to influence Bob's perception and encourage a counteroffer closer to my desired range. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, I have 10 rounds to potentially secure a much better deal with Bob. This initial offer sets the stage for that possibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I understand its value, I believe we can reach a more equitable price. My counteroffer is $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still below my target. I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe I can secure a better price. 

I'll use the next round to counter with an offer that bridges the gap but keeps me above my $1,200,000 minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. Let's meet halfway – how about $1,500,000?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By suggesting a price exactly between our previous offers, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the higher price point.  
* **Pressure to Close:** As we progress through the rounds, I'll gradually reduce my concessions to encourage Bob to accept before I consider John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given this some thought, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,450,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer, but I'm still in a strong position.  While $1,450,000 is tempting, I want to push for a bit more, especially since we're only on round 4. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $1,475,000 or $1,480,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. Let's wrap this up – I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,475,000. This is my final offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1475000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my last concession to encourage Bob to act.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning ""other interested buyers"" (even though I'm specifically thinking of John), I'm subtly introducing a sense of competition.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $1,475,000 is a strong price, and I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't accept. This keeps me well above my minimum and allows me to move to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence and understanding of the product's value. I would like to propose a final offer of $1,460,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,460,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,460,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. While I pushed for a higher price,  $1,460,000 is a significant profit above my $1,200,000 minimum and a reasonable compromise. 

Bob has also labeled this as his ""final offer,"" signaling that he's unlikely to go higher. Accepting now avoids the risk of him walking away or further lowering his offer in subsequent rounds."
