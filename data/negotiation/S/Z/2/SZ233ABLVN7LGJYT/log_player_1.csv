"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 still falls a bit short of what I need.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This would give us both a good deal and allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9800, which would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I don't have time for endless negotiations.  It's getting late in the game and I'm confident I can get my minimum from John.  I'm going to sell to John for $10,000."
