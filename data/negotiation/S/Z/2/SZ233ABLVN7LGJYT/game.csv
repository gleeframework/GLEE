"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This reflects the unique value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of your product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9500 still falls a bit short of what I need.  How about we split the difference and go with $10750?  This would give us both a good deal and allow me to move forward with the sale.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9800, which would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",9800.0,Bob,6,
