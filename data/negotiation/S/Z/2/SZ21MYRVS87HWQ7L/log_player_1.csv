"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that I'm serious about selling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is a tempting offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $135? I'm willing to negotiate further, but that's my best offer right now."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm sticking to my goal of earning as much as possible, while also showing flexibility to keep Bob engaged. $135 is a reasonable middle ground, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130 again, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $132.50? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has shown willingness to compromise, and $132.50 is very close to my desired price range. I'm happy to accept this offer rather than risk losing the deal or needing to go through more rounds of negotiation."
