Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable to you, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I believe I can get a better price. I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to go above $1,050,000. I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk him walking away completely. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so I'll go with that."
