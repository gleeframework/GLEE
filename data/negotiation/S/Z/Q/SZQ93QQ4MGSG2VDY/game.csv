"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,750,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,600,000? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
