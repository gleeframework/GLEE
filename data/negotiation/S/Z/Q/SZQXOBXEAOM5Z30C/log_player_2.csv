**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than your $1,500,000 maximum, you know you have another option with John.  There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down further.  Even if she doesn't budge, you're still covered by John's offer."
