"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This would still allow you a good deal, and it would be closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I'll consider your proposal. How about we aim for $1,300,000? It's higher than my initial offer but still within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,375,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can reach a deal if we both compromise a bit.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, Alice. I'll consider your proposal. How about we aim for $1,325,000? It's a step forward from my previous offer, and I believe this price is reasonable for both parties.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,325,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to go down a bit further to $1,400,000, but I'm really pushing the limits of my flexibility. It would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a valuable investment for you.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1400000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your position, Alice. I'll consider your proposal. How about we aim for $1,350,000? It's a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe this price is reasonable for both parties.",1350000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a common ground. However, $1,350,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000 as a final compromise. This would allow me to make a deal with you, but I'm  pushing the limits of my flexibility.  This offer is on the table for this round only. If you're not ready to commit at this price, I'll have to explore other options for selling this product. ",1450000.0,Alice,9,
