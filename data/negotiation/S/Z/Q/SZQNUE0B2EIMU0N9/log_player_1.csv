Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's significantly less than Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** A $100 starting price allows for several counteroffers before reaching my minimum of $80. 
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, I'm not in a rush to sell.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Potentially get a better price:** I can counter with a price closer to my desired $100.
* **Gauge Bob's true interest:** Seeing how much he's willing to raise his offer will give me more information.
* **Preserve options:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the possibility of selling to John open if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate! $85 is a little lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's a good price for both of us, and still gives me some room to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  $95 is a middle ground between my initial $100 and Bob's $85. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates the product's value to me.
* **Highlight the value for both sides:**  The message emphasizes that $95 is a good price for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintain a positive and open tone:**  The message remains friendly and encourages continued negotiation."
