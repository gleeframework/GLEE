"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is less than the $120 John is asking, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate! $85 is a little lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's a good price for both of us, and still gives me some room to cover my costs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $95 is still under Bob's maximum of $120.
* **Negotiation is progressing:** Alice has already moved from $100 to $95, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk of losing a good deal:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a chance Alice will stick to her $95 price or even increase it.  There's also the risk that Alice could get frustrated and stop negotiating.

While Bob could try to get the price down even further, accepting the $95 offer is a good balance of saving money and ensuring a deal."
