"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $2,300,000 represents the high end of the product's value, $1,100,000 undervalues it significantly. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product represents good value, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? I think that's a fair price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
