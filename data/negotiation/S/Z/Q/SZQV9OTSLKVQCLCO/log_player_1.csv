Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm asking Bob for his thoughts to gauge his interest and potentially get him to make the first counteroffer. 

This strategy allows me to see how much Bob values the product while ensuring I don't sell it for less than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking for something around $120. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for Future Negotiations:** Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale while still leaving room for potential future negotiations with other buyers if I find a better price.
* **Avoid Risk:**  Selling to John for $120 would be a guaranteed deal, but I'm not certain if I can get a better price from another buyer. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I minimize risk and secure a profit while still leaving open the possibility of finding a better deal in the future."
