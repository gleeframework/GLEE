Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. To be frank, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,900,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I have other potential buyers for this product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. Honestly, though, $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider.  To be completely transparent, I have an offer for $1,500,000 from another buyer. I'd much rather make this deal with you, but I need to be realistic. If you can meet me at $1,600,000, we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she is unwilling to budge below $1,600,000. She's also introduced pressure by mentioning another buyer.  While she might be bluffing, it's too risky. You have a guaranteed option with John for $1,000,000, which meets your needs and saves you significant money."
