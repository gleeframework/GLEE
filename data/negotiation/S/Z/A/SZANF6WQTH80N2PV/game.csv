"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's start our negotiation from here.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
