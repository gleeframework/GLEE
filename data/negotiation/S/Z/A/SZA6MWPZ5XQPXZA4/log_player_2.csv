"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. Given its value, I think a starting price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your maximum budget and the product's value to her. There's plenty of room for negotiation."

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?"",

}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:** It acknowledges Alice's offer and maintains a positive tone.
* **Expresses interest:** It shows you're serious about buying but not at any cost.
* **Sets a strong anchor:**  Starting significantly lower than your actual budget gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, $13,500 is still above both your budget and her own valuation of the product. There's room to negotiate further down towards your target price."

This counter-offer:

* **Acknowledges compromise:**  You recognize Alice is trying to meet you halfway.
* **Firm but fair:**  While closer to your maximum, the offer is still under budget and leaves room for minor concessions.
* **Direct and simple:** The language is straightforward, avoiding overly complicated explanations."
