"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product, $1,200,000 is slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still a significant profit for you and within my spending limit. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $1,150,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Would this be something you'd be interested in?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand we're close to reaching an agreement, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, which is a compromise that's slightly above your last offer. Let me know if this works for you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
