""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your operations, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run.  Given its worth, I'm offering it to you for $1,190,000. I think it's a fair price considering its potential impact on your business."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a slightly lower price with Bob could still yield a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting near the top of Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) allows room for negotiation downwards while still remaining above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob's specific needs helps justify the high price. 

This offer attempts to find a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still securing a sale, as we have a guaranteed buyer at our minimum price."
