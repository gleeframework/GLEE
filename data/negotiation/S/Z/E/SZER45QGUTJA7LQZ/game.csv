"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'd be happy to buy it for $8000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  While $14000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $10000. Would you be open to that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $10000 is still a bit too low for me. I can do $13000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to go up to $11000. How about we split the difference and I buy it for $12000?",12000.0,Bob,6,
