"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $850,000 is below its true worth. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand the value you place on the product. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you be open to considering $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
