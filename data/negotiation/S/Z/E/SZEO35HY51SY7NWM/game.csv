"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a very competitive price for what you're getting.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try $11,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing you're serious about this purchase and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  $12,500 is my final offer - it's a steal at this price and reflects how much I value you as a potential customer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
