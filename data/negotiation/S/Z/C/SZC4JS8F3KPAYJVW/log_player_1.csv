Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I know it's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know it's worth to Bob. This is a common strategy in negotiations to leave room for bargaining.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $150, so I have a solid fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't sell for less than my minimum price of $150. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  This is still a good deal for you, and it works for me."", ""product_price"": 150}
