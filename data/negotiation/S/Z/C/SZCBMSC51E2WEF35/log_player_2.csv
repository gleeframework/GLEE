"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. This is a good deal, but you can potentially do better.
* There's a significant difference between your value and Alice's ($15,000 - $8,000 = $7,000). This indicates room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down from her initial price of $12,000 to $11,000. 
* This is a good deal for you since you value the product at $15,000, and it's still above Alice's minimum value of $8,000.
* Accepting the offer allows you to save $4,000 compared to buying from John.  
* While further negotiation is possible, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price is not worth it."
