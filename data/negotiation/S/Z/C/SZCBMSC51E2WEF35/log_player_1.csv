{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the product's value to Bob, which might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired value. I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
