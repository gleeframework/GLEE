Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still staying within my budget.

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach a number that surpasses what John is offering. It's time to cut my losses and make the guaranteed sale."
