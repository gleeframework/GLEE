"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a great starting point. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this point.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1,075,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
