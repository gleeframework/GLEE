"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to get the product for as low as possible, and $110 is still above your maximum budget. You can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice, making it worthwhile to reject her initial offer and try for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

You know the product is worth $100 to Alice.  Offering $105 gives her a small profit and is still within your budget. This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to your budget, it's still above what you're willing to pay. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. The product is worth $100 to her, so there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility by moving from $115 to $110. This shows she's willing to negotiate. By offering $110, you are meeting her halfway, demonstrating your seriousness without going over your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $112, which is very close to your maximum budget of $120. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your offer and pushing the price back up is high.  It's likely that you won't be able to get a lower price from Alice, and you only have 5 rounds left.  Accepting her offer is the best strategy to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with."
