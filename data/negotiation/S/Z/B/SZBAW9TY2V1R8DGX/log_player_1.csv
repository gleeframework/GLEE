"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still get a good price. I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob, but I want to see where he stands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price, especially since I know it's worth at least $1,200,000 to me.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,200,000.  This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's still a fair deal considering the value of the product.  I hope Bob will see reason and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable. Bob needs to come up higher, and I'm willing to keep negotiating.  I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more. I want to see if Bob will come up closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$950,000 is still too low. I'm not willing to accept anything under $1,000,000 at this point. I have a few more rounds to work with Bob, and I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to stick to my guns and counteroffer at $1,000,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, and I'm hoping Bob recognizes the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway. If he doesn't, I'm going to start considering selling to John, as my minimum price is $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer, but $975,000 is still below my minimum. We're running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk ending up with less than I'm comfortable with.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal, and I don't want to keep negotiating with Bob."
