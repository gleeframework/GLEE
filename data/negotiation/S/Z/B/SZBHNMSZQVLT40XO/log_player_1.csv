"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable and would greatly benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:**  I don't want to start too high and scare Bob away, but I also want to ensure there's space to negotiate down if needed.
* **Confident Tone:** My message conveys the product's value and my belief in its worth to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,050,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my target and even dips below what John is offering.  While I want to work with Bob, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting his offer signals I'm serious about a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for what this product offers.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,110,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Ground but Showing Flexibility:** I want to demonstrate willingness to negotiate but not at the cost of a substantial loss. 
* **Strategic Concession:** By coming down $40,000, I'm making a significant move to signal my interest in closing a deal while still aiming for a price well above Bob's initial offer.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Framing:** This language encourages Bob to reciprocate with a similarly sized concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference - $1,080,000.  This still gives you a good profit, and it's getting us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $1,080,000 is a good profit, exceeding my minimum by $80,000. 
* **Time Value:** We're past the halfway point in negotiations. While I might be able to push for a bit more, there's a risk Bob will become less willing to compromise, or I might waste valuable rounds.
* **Building Goodwill:** Accepting Bob's ""split the difference"" offer shows I'm willing to meet him halfway and potentially sets a positive tone for future interactions."
