Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strong Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" to make the offer more enticing. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he is for the product. 
* There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, securing a price closer to his maximum valuation is worth the calculated risk."
