Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $11,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I have to say, I'm getting a bit concerned that we might be getting too close to the price I was hoping to get from John. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

This is a good time to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is Right:** $10,500 is a significant saving compared to John's $15,000 price.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is signaling she might prefer selling to John at this point.  Pushing further risks losing the deal.  

It's always tempting to try for a lower price, but in this case, accepting at $10,500 secures a good deal."
