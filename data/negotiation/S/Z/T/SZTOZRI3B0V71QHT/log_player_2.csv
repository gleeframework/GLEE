Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to you, I propose a price of $1,100,000. This still represents a premium over the market rate but is more in line with your budget. Please let me know if this revised offer suits your needs.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your commitment to finding a fair price for the product. In light of your latest proposal, I would like to suggest a price of $1,085,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but it also reflects the unique value and quality of the product. I hope this revised offer will be acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still a gap.  Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  He's still better off than buying from John, so rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're getting closer, but $1,085,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $1,070,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to move further towards your offer.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1070000}
