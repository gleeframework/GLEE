Alice's offer:

```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $85, and her ""final offer"" tactic suggests she's unlikely to budge further.  Since your absolute maximum is $80 and John offers that price, it's time to take the guaranteed deal rather than risk Alice sticking to her guns."
