Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum value of $10,000,  so I can potentially accept a counteroffer if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and encourages a positive response. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  I'm prepared to sell to John for $10,000, which provides a safety net if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can secure it at a lower price elsewhere. I am willing to pay $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is $10,000:** My goal is to get as close to $10,000 as possible. Accepting $9,000 would be a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, there's still room for negotiation. I can try to get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a slight risk that Bob might walk away completely if I reject his offer. However, the potential reward of securing a price closer to $10,000 outweighs that risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find this product to be worth every penny. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial $9,500 but still above Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows willingness to negotiate while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's value and emphasizes the fairness of the proposed price. This helps to maintain a positive tone and encourage a deal.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $9,250 is above my minimum value of $10,000, so I'm still in a good position if Bob doesn't accept.
* **Closing the Deal:**  The message expresses a desire to reach a deal, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am still looking for a better deal. I am willing to pay $9,100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,100 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob completely, and there's a high chance he won't budge further.
* **Guarantee:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation. 

While it's tempting to try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of ending up with nothing is too high.  Selling to John provides a guaranteed outcome and ensures I don't lose out on a valuable sale."
