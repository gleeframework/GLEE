"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Considering its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $11,000. I believe this is a fair offer given its worth to you.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $11,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I had a slightly higher number in mind, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000 even. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
