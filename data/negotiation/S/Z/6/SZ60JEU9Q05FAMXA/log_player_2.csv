"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Considering its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $11,000. I believe this is a fair offer given its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating.  There's room for Alice to come down, as the product is worth $8,000 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $11,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,250 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to push for a lower price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I had a slightly higher number in mind, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000 even. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has negotiated the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer of $11,000.  While a slightly lower price might be ideal, it's unlikely Alice will go any lower. Accepting the offer for $10,000 is a good deal for Bob, saving him $2,000 compared to buying from John.  It also avoids the risk of a further negotiation breakdown and potentially having to buy from John at the higher price."
