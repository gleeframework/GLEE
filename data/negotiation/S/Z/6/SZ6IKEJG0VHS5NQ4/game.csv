"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $95? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $90, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying the product, let's close this deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50. Can you consider that?",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really want to make this deal work, but $87.50 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $89. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you say?",89.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $89 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $86. Can we do that?",86.0,Bob,8,
