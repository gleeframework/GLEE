"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price. I have 9 rounds remaining and can always choose to sell to John for $120 if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $95? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer, $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not desperate, so I'll reject his offer and try to get a price closer to $95 or higher. I still have 6 rounds left and the option to sell to John for $120 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $90, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying the product, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, $87.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm determined to get at least $90, so I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price. I have 4 rounds left and can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really want to make this deal work, but $87.50 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $89. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $89 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $86. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I've reached a point where it's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to negotiate a price that meets my minimum acceptable price of $120. Bob's offer of $86 is getting closer, but I'm starting to run out of rounds.  To avoid the risk of losing out on a better price and to ensure I get at least my minimum, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. This decision guarantees me the highest possible profit in this situation."
