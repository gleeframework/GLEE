"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,600,000. This price is still fair considering the value it brings you, and it gives us both room to be happy with the deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit and allows me to stay within budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
