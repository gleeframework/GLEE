"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since you are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering the product for $120, there is no benefit to accepting her offer. You can get the same product for the same price from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price with her in the future."
