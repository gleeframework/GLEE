Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can secure a better deal with Bob.  Selling to John would be a safe option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  While I'm running out of rounds, I'm not willing to settle for a price that low.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John is always a safe option, but I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal with Bob."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. With only four rounds left, the chances of securing a better price are slim. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees I meet my minimum goal, and I can avoid further negotiation and potential losses."
