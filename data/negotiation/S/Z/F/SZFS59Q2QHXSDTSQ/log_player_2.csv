"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above your target of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's above your minimum, and it gets me closer to my target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This price is still well above my minimum and provides you with a significant value. Let's meet halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your target price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high.  Since you can get the product from John for $1,000,000, you should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before committing. There's still potential for a better deal."
