"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,025,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your investment.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $975,000. Can we compromise on that?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows you a significant return on your investment.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $975,000. This is the maximum I can go, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
