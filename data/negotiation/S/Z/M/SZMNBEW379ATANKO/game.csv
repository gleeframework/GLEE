"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product at a price of $1500000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it holds immense value. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and discussing the price further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $900000 is lower than my initial asking price, it's unfortunately not a figure I can accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit while acknowledging the value you see in this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. Can you consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest.  $1050000 is closer, but I'm still a bit below where I need to be to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1100000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand this is your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1050000. This is the maximum I can go, and I hope you can understand my position.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
