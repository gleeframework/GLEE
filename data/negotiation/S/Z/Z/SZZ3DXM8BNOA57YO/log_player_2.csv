"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I believe you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial value, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  It makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save the $19."
