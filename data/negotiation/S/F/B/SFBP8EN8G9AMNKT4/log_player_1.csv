Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price that's closer to my minimum of $1,200,000.  I'll see what Bob's response is before making further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not immediately willing to settle for it. There are still 9 rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,350,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. It's a compromise that hopefully pushes us towards a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's a bit more than my minimum, and we're already on round 4. Continuing the negotiation might lead to more back and forth, potentially costing me time and potentially jeopardizing a sale. Accepting his offer feels like the best decision at this point."
