"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within my maximum spending limit of $1,000,000. Would it be possible for you to adjust your offer to meet my budget?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its potential value.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your understanding, Alice. Given my financial situation, I am unable to meet at $1,075,000. I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum budget of $1,000,000. Could we perhaps find a mutually agreeable price around $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
