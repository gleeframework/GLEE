"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. This is a unique asset, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,500,000 for this product, which is the maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value we both recognize in the product.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial price reflects the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't accept $1,500,000. How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000? This demonstrates my willingness to make a deal while ensuring a fair return on this valuable asset.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still above my limit. I'm prepared to pay $1,600,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you say?",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,650,000, which is a fair price considering the value we both recognize in this product. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this point.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
