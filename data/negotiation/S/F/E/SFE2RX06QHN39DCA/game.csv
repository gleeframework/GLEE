"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product at a price that I believe is fair for both of us.  I'm asking $1300000.  It's a significant investment, but I know this product will be incredibly valuable to you.  Let me know your thoughts!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end and still allows me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1000000 is still a little outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to go as high as $900000.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. ",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us. To show my commitment to making this happen, I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it's the closest I can come to your offer while still covering my costs. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
