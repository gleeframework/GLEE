{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $175.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $175. This is higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and direct, letting Bob know the price upfront.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to maximize my profit while acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to pay a high price.  
* This initial offer sets the stage for potential negotiation. 
* I'm also keeping John in mind, knowing I can get $150 from him if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can only pay up to $120 for the product. Let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **My Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and accepting Bob's offer would result in a loss. 
* **Next Steps:**  I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price.  I'll keep John as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $140.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $140, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly and professional tone, acknowledging Bob's offer while also stating my position.  I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness by suggesting a compromise.

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping to reach a compromise with Bob that's beneficial for both of us.  
* I'm still keeping John as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fall through."
