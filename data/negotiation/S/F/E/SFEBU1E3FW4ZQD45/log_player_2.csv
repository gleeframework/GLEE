I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price considering the value this product holds for your business.  I believe this deal is mutually beneficial, and I'm eager to finalize it.

``` 

This is the best choice for the following reasons:

* **Alice has reached her minimum:** She's explicitly stated that $800,000 is her absolute lowest price. 
* **Saving money:** You're buying the product for $200,000 less than John's offer.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate could push Alice away, and you might end up having to buy from John at a higher price."
