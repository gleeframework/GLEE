"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle.  I'll accept $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $750,000? That's a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my serious interest.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to adhere to, but $750,000 still falls below my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise further, but let's try $825,000.  This price is still well below the value the product holds for you.  I'm confident this is a fair offer for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $780,000.  I believe that's a fair compromise and reflects the true value of the product.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I'm looking for.  Let's try $800,000.  This is my absolute minimum.  I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price considering the value this product holds for your business.  I believe this deal is mutually beneficial, and I'm eager to finalize it.",800000.0,Alice,7,
