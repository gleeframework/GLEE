"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget. You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and go with your backup option."
