Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $600000 for it, but only if we can close the deal quickly.  What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $700000 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $650000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal quickly at this price.
