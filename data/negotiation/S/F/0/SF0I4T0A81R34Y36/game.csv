"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $125 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $125 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're holding out for a higher price, but I'm still firm on my budget.  I'm happy to pay $135, which is a fair middle ground for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $135 is still below what I'm comfortable accepting.  Let's try $145. I'm getting closer to your offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $145 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $140, which is my final offer.  Let's close this deal.",140.0,Bob,6,
