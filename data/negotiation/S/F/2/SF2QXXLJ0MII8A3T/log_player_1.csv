Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a higher price like $1,000,000 leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing our minimum price, aiming to justify the high asking price. 
* **Open for Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.
* **Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, ensuring we don't lose out. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
