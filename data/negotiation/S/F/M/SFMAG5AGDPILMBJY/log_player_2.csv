"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to get a great deal on a high-value item. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$12,000 is way above your budget. It's better to counteroffer or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$10,000 is still above your budget. You can try to negotiate further or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $10,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still negotiating, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting the product, but I'm not ready to give up on the profit just yet. I'll meet you at $9,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still above budget, but you're getting closer.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before giving up and buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still just a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,250, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to give up yet, Bob! I'll meet you at $9,250, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet in the middle of our last two offers, at $9,375? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $9,375 is closer to your goal, it's still above your budget. You've reached a point where you're unlikely to get it for $8,000. It's best to go with John's offer and avoid further negotiation."
