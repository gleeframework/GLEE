"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to get a great deal on a high-value item. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $10,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still negotiating, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting the product, but I'm not ready to give up on the profit just yet. I'll meet you at $9,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still just a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,250, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. What do you think?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to give up yet, Bob! I'll meet you at $9,250, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet in the middle of our last two offers, at $9,375? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9375.0,Alice,7,
