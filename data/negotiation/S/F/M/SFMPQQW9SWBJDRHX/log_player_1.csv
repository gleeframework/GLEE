Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him room to negotiate without feeling like he's being ripped off.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate downward if necessary, and ensures you're not giving away the product for less than your minimum. 

Remember, the goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but also to ensure a deal happens. By offering a reasonable starting price, you maximize your chances of making a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum and even below his own perceived value.  It's too risky to accept such a low price.  By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap, potentially getting closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's find a middle ground and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  It's a significant move from your previous offer but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Maintain your value:**  It's above your minimum price, ensuring you don't lose out on a significant portion of the value you place on the product. 
* **Be persuasive:**  It highlights the potential for a ""great deal"" for Bob while acknowledging his initial offer. 

This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we are trying to find a fair price. How about we settle at $11,500? That would be a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to you. It's worth exploring further negotiation with Bob, hoping to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,500 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer the product for $12,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the gap:** This offer is a compromise that's closer to Bob's last offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Stay above minimum:** It's still above your minimum price, ensuring you don't lose too much on the deal.
* **Focus on fairness:** It emphasizes a ""fair price"" for both parties, making it more appealing to Bob.

By meeting Bob halfway, you increase the chances of reaching an agreement without compromising your financial goals too much."
