Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000.  This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob could net you a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 positions it just below your guaranteed price but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a strong incentive for Bob to consider the deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" adds a time pressure element, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This strategy balances risk and reward.  If Bob accepts, you make a significant profit. If he rejects, you still have the guaranteed sale to John."
