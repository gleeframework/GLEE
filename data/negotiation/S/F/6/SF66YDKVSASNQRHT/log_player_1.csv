"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,200,000."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique features and potential"" to justify the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room:** Even if this offer is rejected, it sets a high anchor point for future rounds of negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving the door open for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am currently looking for a more affordable option. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. Selling to John right now would meet my minimum, but I believe I can get a higher price from Bob with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It has unique features that you won't find elsewhere.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've significantly lowered my asking price from $2,200,000 to $1,800,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm aiming for a price that's still significantly above my minimum but shows movement toward Bob's offer.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's unique value proposition to justify the higher price point.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to engage more seriously in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is significantly higher than his initial offer and provides me with a substantial profit margin over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or stalling negotiations further.
* **Time Value:** While I could potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, each round consumes time and there's always the risk of Bob walking away. Taking the profit now is a safe and favorable outcome."
