"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10,500 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,500 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is a fair compromise. It's getting late in our negotiations, so let's see if we can finalize this. ",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,200, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to consider this price?",12200.0,Bob,6,
