``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me, aiming for a good profit. I'm also trying to be friendly and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10,500 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below it. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. It's getting close to my ""sell to John"" price, but I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,500 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is a fair compromise. It's getting late in our negotiations, so let's see if we can finalize this. "", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,200, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,200 is just above my minimum price and a good profit for me. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn.  I'll accept his offer."
