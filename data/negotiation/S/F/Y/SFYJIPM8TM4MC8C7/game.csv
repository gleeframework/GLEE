"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know its worth at least $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000.  This is still a fantastic price for you, considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's find a middle ground and get this deal done.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, and so am I.  $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That's a significant move on my part.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product, and it gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting us closer.  I'm prepared to offer $910,000 to get this done today.  It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in closing the deal now.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $910,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $915,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and it's a price that allows us both to come away from this deal feeling satisfied.  Let's make this happen!",915000.0,Alice,7,
