Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000.  This is still a fantastic price for you, considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's find a middle ground and get this deal done.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $910,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $915,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and it's a price that allows us both to come away from this deal feeling satisfied.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is a good deal compared to John's offer. Accepting now secures the product at a favorable price."
