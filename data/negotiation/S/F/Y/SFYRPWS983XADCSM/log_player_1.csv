"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high starting offer, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and what his budget might be. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, but I'll keep in mind that I have John as a backup buyer for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is far below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This will allow me to secure a deal and avoid having to sell to John, which would be a less favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not comfortable accepting yet. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price again, but only to $1,100,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise. If he rejects this, I'll likely sell to John, as I'm not confident Bob will go much higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close, but I'm not convinced Bob will go higher.  With only a few rounds left, I'm going to take John's offer.  It's guaranteed and meets my minimum price."
