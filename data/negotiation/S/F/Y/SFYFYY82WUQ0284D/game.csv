"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it!  I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $110 is closer, but I'm still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $108?  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can finalize this deal quickly.",108.0,Bob,4,
