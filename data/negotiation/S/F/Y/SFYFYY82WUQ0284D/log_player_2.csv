"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it!  I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price ($120).**  
* **It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get a better deal.** 
* **You have 10 rounds, so you have time to negotiate.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer.**  $105 is a good starting point, showing you're serious about negotiating but also leaving room for compromise.
* **Be polite and positive.**  A friendly tone can help keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Frame it as a mutually beneficial deal.**  Suggesting that finding a price that works for both of you helps emphasize collaboration."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum price ($120).**  While it's closer, it's not a deal you can accept yet. 
* **You have time to negotiate further.**  It's worth seeing if you can get Alice down further.
* **You can always buy from John as a fallback option.**  This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $110 is closer, but I'm still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $108?  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can finalize this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Counteroffer:**  A small counteroffer shows you're serious about buying but also willing to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  Emphasize ""fair price"" and ""finalize the deal quickly"" to encourage a quick agreement.
* **Maintain a Friendly Tone:**  Keep the communication friendly and collaborative."
