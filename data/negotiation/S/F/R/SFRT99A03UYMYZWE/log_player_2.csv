It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there's room for a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was hoping we could get closer to my original price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $800000, so I'm offering the product to you for $825000. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While I'd prefer a lower price, $825,000 is a good deal considering I could buy from John for $1,000,000."
