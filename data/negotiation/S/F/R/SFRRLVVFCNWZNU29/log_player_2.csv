"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering its potential return on investment. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is above your limit:**  $1,350,000 is more than the $1,000,000 you're willing to spend.
* **You have a backup plan:** John offers the product at your desired price. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move to John and secure the product at your target price."
