{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering its potential return on investment. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the ""unique value"" and ""potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the high price and potentially shift Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signals to Bob that Alice is open to discussing the price and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable deal. 

**Important Note:** Alice has a strong fallback option with John, ensuring she won't be forced to accept anything less than her minimum acceptable price."
