This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential bargaining. It also frames the offer positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000 for the product. I'm willing to pay a premium for a good deal, but I'm not looking to break the bank. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is more than the minimum I'm willing to accept, it's still lower than my initial offer. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,500?  That way we can both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $9500. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $8800? I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,800 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution.  $8,800 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's split the difference:  $9,150.  That's a fair price that reflects the product's value and my willingness to compromise."", ""product_price"": 9150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8800. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. How about $8900? I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I've already had a few rounds of negotiation with Bob and we seem to be stuck. To guarantee a sale and avoid further potential back-and-forth, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  This ensures I get a fair price and avoid any further risk of a deal falling through."
