"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
