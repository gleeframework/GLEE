"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the price. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to make a profit, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $107.50. Can we meet at this price?",107.5,Bob,4,
