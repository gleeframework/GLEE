"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm sure you'll find it useful. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $120 to Alice, so she is already making a decent profit by offering it for $110. However, it's worth less to you, so you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That way, we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice has moved closer to your desired price. While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk she'll reject your counteroffer and you might end up paying more in the long run. Accepting her offer of $100 ensures you get the product while saving $20 compared to buying from John."
