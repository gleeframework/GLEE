"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's a significant margin for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and would get me closer to my ideal price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This is still a great deal for you as you value it at $15000.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good price for Bob considering he values the product at $15,000.  While there's still a slight margin for negotiation, accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a lower price than John's offer and secures the deal without further haggling."
