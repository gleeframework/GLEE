``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for potential concessions if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and would get me closer to my ideal price.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than $8,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you as you value it at $15,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
