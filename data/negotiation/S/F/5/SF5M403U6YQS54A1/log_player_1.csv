{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum.  It also opens the door for further negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my $10,000 goal, but I'm willing to go down a bit to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9500 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to compromise, but I want to get as close to my $10,000 goal as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $8800 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9150? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9150} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $8,900 is still a bit lower than I'd hoped, it's getting closer to my minimum. I'm also concerned about the potential of further negotiation with Bob dragging things out and potentially jeopardizing the deal with John.  Selling to Bob for $8,900 is the best option at this point."
