"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be open to considering this counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your position. While $950,000 is certainly appealing, the value this product represents, especially given your plans for it, makes that price point a challenge.  Could we consider $1,050,000?  This feels like a fairer reflection of its potential.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $980,000. This price point still reflects the value I see in the product, but it's a more comfortable fit for my financials. Would you be open to this counteroffer?",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. How about we settle at $1,010,000? This reflects the value it holds while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1010000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,010,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer of $980,000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options, including purchasing from John for $1,200,000. I'm confident that this price reflects a fair value for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
