Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your position. While $950,000 is certainly appealing, the value this product represents, especially given your plans for it, makes that price point a challenge.  Could we consider $1,050,000?  This feels like a fairer reflection of its potential.
