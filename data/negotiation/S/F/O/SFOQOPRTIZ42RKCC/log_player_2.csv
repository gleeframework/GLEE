"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are aiming to get the product for as low as possible, and $9,000 is still above your target of $12,000. You have more rounds to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer Alice, I appreciate you considering my interest.  However,  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. After reconsidering, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer. Alice has lowered her price from $9,000 to $8,500, which is within your budget of $12,000 and a good deal for you.  You've saved $500 compared to buying from John.  While you might be able to get a slightly lower price, it's not worth risking losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
