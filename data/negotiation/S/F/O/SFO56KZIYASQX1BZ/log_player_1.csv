"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is significantly below my minimum, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob that is mutually agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is above my minimum of $150. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a good deal considering the limited rounds and the certainty of a sale."
