"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
