Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My next offer is $11,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $10,500. Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, it makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from him. You've successfully negotiated a lower price, but sometimes the best deals are made by walking away."
