"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I agree this product could be beneficial, the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $8,000 to make this deal work.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $12,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting my budget and the value this product brings.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $12,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My next offer is $11,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
