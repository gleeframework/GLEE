"I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105.",105.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $95? That's closer to what I was hoping for.",95.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $100, but that's as low as I can go.",100.0,Alice,5,,
