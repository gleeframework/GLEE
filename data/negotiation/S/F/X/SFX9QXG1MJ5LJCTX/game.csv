"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $9,750? That's a bit closer to my target price.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for a middle ground.  How about $10,000? I'm willing to come down a bit more to finalize this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,875? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",9875.0,Bob,6,
