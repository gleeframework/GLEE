"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am unable to meet the price of $1,300,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need a bit more than $1,200,000 to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a good price point for both of us, as itâ€™s still less than what I would sell it for to someone else. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm still not able to meet the price of $1,250,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,225,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is closer to what you're looking for.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,225,000 is still a little low for me.  Let's try $1,240,000.  This is a fair compromise that considers both of our positions.  What do you think?",1240000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, I am still unable to meet the price of $1,240,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,237,500 for the product. I hope this revised offer is within your consideration.",1237500.0,Bob,6,
