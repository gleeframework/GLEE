Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value,"" you subtly anchor the product's worth in Bob's mind, increasing his perceived value.
* **Leaving Room:** While $20,000 is a significant markup, it leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying well above your minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of John's offer ($15,000), so you can afford to be a bit bolder with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a sense that he's getting a fair deal."
