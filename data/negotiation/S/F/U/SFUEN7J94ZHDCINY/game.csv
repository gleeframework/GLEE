"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've personally valued at over $1,000,000, and I'm confident it holds the same potential for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000, reflecting the unique value it holds. This is a special opportunity, as I have a backup buyer who is willing to pay $1,000,000 if you decline. Let me know your thoughts!",1050000.0,Alice,1,
