"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000. I believe this is a fair price that considers both its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while still providing you a good deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $875,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my ideal budget.  Would you consider $750,000?  I'm eager to reach a deal and feel this price is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is moving closer to your acceptable range, but you're still above your guaranteed sale price with John. Continuing the negotiation is the best strategy at this point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $825,000? I believe this price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $780,000 to get this done today. It's a strong offer and reflects my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to your acceptable price, you're now very near your guaranteed sale price with John.  Bob is moving slowly, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result. It's a strategic decision to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
