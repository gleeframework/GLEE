"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair starting point considering its potential return on investment for you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your position, however, the value of this product is truly significant and I can't let it go for that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly see the value in this product, and I want to find a way for us to make this work.  While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, I'm confident it's worth more.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? This keeps us moving towards a fair deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $1,175,000 is closer, but I need to stay within a certain budget.  Would you consider $1,125,000?  That's the best I can do.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
