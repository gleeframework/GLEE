"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $900,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably offer right now.  I'm prepared to pay $875,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $875,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $885,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",885000.0,Alice,5,
