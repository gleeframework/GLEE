Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, so there's less pressure to drastically lower the price for Bob."
