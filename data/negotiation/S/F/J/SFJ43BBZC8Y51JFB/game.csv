"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go above $1200000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'd like to make it clear that I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer of $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
