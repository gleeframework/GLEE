Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're moving closer to my price point. However, $12,500 is still a bit below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch to $13,000, but that's really as high as I can go. I think that's a fair deal considering John's offer."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, and I'm willing to make one last concession.  $13,500 is my final offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to John's offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $13,500, and she's even using John's offer as leverage. While getting the product for $13,500 wouldn't be bad, you can get it for a guaranteed $10,000 from John.  It's time to cut your losses with Alice and secure the better deal."
