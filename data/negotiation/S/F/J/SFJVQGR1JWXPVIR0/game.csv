"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to move a little on my price. How about $12,500?  That's a fair offer considering John is offering a similar product.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're moving closer to my price point. However, $12,500 is still a bit below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal!",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch to $13,000, but that's really as high as I can go. I think that's a fair deal considering John's offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, and I'm willing to make one last concession.  $13,500 is my final offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to John's offer.",13500.0,Alice,7,
