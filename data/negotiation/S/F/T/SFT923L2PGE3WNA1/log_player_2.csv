**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  $10,000
* **Your Value:** $12,000
* **John's Price:** $12,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, the risk of losing the deal entirely outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
