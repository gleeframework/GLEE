"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While $90 is less than John's price, you can likely get a better deal from Alice.  You're willing to pay up to $100, so there's room for negotiation."
