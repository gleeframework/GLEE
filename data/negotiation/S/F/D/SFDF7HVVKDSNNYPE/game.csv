"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This still allows me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget, while also acknowledging its worth. I look forward to your response.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return on this product. How about we settle on $900,000?  This is a price that reflects the product's value and allows for a smooth transaction.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've given it careful consideration, and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still not able to meet you at $900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $875,000. This price still allows me to stay within my budget while reflecting the value of your product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to drop to $890,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product while ensuring I get a reasonable return.  Let's close this deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,
