"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still higher than the product's worth to her ($10,000), it's lower than the price John is asking ($12,000).  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John."
