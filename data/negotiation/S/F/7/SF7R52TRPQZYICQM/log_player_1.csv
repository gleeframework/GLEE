``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $95 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $107.50? I'm willing to be flexible to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.50}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $100 is closer to my desired price, but I'm still confident I can get a slightly higher price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, and I appreciate you coming up in price. However, $100 still falls a little short of what I need to make this worthwhile.
