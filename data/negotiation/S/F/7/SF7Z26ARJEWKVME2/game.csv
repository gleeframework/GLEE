"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This price still reflects the true value of the product.",10250.0,Alice,3,
