"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can save $2,000 by buying from John, but negotiating with Alice could potentially lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Alice is getting closer to your price, $9,000 is still more than you are willing to pay. Continue negotiating with her to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $8,750 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to go lower than $9,250. While this is a better deal than the initial $10,000 offer, it's still more than you are willing to pay. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000 to save some money."
