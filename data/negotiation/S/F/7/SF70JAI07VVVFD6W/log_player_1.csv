{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but it's also a price I believe is fair considering the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While I'm not happy with Bob's offer,  it's too early to settle for $15,000. I believe I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see where we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm countering with $17,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and closer to the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  $15,000 is my minimum, and I'm not willing to risk getting a worse deal with Bob."
