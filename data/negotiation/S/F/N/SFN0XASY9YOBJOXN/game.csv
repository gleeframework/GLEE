"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $775,000? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let's find a solution we're both happy with.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $775,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $725,000? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000, which is a good compromise. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this deal happen!",750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more. How about $740,000?  That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",740000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $740,000 is getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and accept $745,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, let's finalize it!",745000.0,Alice,7,
