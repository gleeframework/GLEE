"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $1,600,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it, reflecting its value to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your valuation,  $1,600,000 is closer to my price point given the value this product offers.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,350,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is fair considering the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
