Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $1,600,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it, reflecting its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your valuation,  $1,600,000 is closer to my price point given the value this product offers.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,350,000?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,350,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is fair considering the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

**Reasoning:**  Bob has reached our baseline price. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob, as we have a guaranteed offer from John at the same price."
