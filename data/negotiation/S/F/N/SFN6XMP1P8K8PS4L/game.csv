"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable, but that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential for your business. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price that reflects its value. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more conservative with my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers. $800,000 is a significant investment for you, and I understand the need to be mindful of your budget.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $875,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while working within your parameters.  What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
