"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $11000?  That's still a good value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, but it's still higher than his preferred price point. Bob should continue negotiating to try and push the price even lower.  It's worth noting that Bob could always buy from John, but it's still in Bob's best interest to see if he can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us and would let us close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go down to $10900. That's a fair compromise, and it lets us finalize the deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is very close to Bob's preferred price of $10,750.  While Bob could technically continue negotiating or buy from John, the risk is that Alice might reject further counteroffers or the deal with John might fall through. Accepting this offer ensures a successful purchase at a price that's within Bob's budget."
