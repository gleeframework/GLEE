It's not worth it to buy the product from Alice for $20,000 when you can get it from John for $15,000.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try to negotiate a better price."

I'm offering Alice $12,000 for the product. This is significantly lower than her asking price, but still a fair offer given my budget."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Alice's price is still too high.  It's more advantageous to buy from John for a guaranteed $15,000."
