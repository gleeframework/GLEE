"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $650,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to accommodate your budget. This price still allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but the gap is still too wide for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  To show you my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while giving you a good deal.  Let's try to find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,5,
