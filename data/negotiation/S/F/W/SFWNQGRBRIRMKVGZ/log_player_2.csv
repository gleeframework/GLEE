"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500.  This is a great price for both of us, as you know the product is worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice is trying to sell the product for more than it's worth to you. You can get it for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay Alice $12,500."
