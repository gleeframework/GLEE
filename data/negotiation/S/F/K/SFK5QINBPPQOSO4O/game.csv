"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that will bring you a lot of benefits. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $10,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make $14,000 to make it worth my while. How about we compromise at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,500? That's a fair price, and we both walk away happy.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $13,500? I'm willing to give you a better deal than my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, but $13,500 is pushing it for me.  I'm willing to offer $12,000. That's my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",12000.0,Bob,6,
