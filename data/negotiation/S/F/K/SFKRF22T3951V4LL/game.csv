"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a new offer of $1550000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
