"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John at $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's first offer, you might:

* Prompt Alice to offer a lower price as she is motivated to sell. 
* Get closer to a price closer to Alice's own valuation of $800,000.

You'll still have the safety net of buying from John if Alice doesn't come down significantly in price."
