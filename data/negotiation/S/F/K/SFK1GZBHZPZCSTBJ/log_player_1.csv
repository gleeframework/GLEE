Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This represents a significant savings for you compared to selling to John, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
