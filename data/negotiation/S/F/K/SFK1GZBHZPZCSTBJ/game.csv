"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. My asking price is $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This represents a significant savings for you compared to selling to John, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit below my desired price point.  Let's compromise at $950,000.  This price allows me to earn a good return on my investment and offers you a significant value compared to other options.  I'm open to discussing further, but I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference and go with $925,000.  This offer gives you a solid profit and allows me to stay within my budget. It's a win-win situation. What do you say?",925000.0,Bob,4,
