Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate or accept outright. It's unlikely he'll accept the first offer without trying to haggle.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy it for $10,000 provides a safety net. This offer to Bob aims for a significant profit margin before resorting to the backup plan."
