Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice's offer of $10,800 is still above Bob's budget, and he has already reached his final offer. It's more beneficial for Bob to go with the guaranteed price from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
