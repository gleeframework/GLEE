{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This may make Bob more receptive to a lower counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" provides a reason for the high initial price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still allowing you to potentially secure a price significantly above his perceived value. 
* **Backup Option:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, giving you leverage in the negotiation.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response and be willing to walk away if he doesn't meet a price point that's acceptable to you."
