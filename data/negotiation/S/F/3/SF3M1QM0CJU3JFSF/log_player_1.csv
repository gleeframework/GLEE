Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This price is above Bob's perceived value of $80, giving me room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm starting with a friendly tone and highlighting the product's value to Bob. This helps build rapport and sets the stage for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By starting at a higher price, I have room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I can also leverage the threat of selling to John for $150 as a bargaining chip. This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell for that low.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $100 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  That's still a good price for you, and it gives me a fair return on the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$130:**  This price is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Message:**  I reiterate that I value his interest and offer a reason for my counteroffer, focusing on a fair price for both of us. This helps maintain a positive and collaborative tone. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150 while keeping the negotiation open.  I'm confident that I can achieve this through further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $110. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer of $110 is still below my threshold.  I'm confident that John is a more reliable buyer and will pay my minimum price of $150.  Selling to John is the best option in this situation."
