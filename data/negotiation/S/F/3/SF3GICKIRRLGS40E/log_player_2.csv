Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, while also being more reasonable for you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to see that we're getting close to a deal! However, I'm not quite ready to give up on the extra $50,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'd like to propose a compromise: $1,045,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,045,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,045,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good deal for Bob. He's getting the product for well under his maximum budget and Alice is clearly motivated to sell. Holding out for a lower price at this point carries more risk than reward."
