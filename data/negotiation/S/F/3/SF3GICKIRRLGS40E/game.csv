"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. Let's discuss further!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the product's value, but that price point is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, while also being more reasonable for you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,075,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $1,025,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to see that we're getting close to a deal! However, I'm not quite ready to give up on the extra $50,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'd like to propose a compromise: $1,045,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",1045000.0,Alice,5,
