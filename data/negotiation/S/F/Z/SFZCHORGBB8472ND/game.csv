"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and gives me a healthy profit.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product.
