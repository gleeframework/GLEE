"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still allows us to both get what we want. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you consider $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further. $1,075,000 is still a little below my desired range, but I'm open to closing the deal. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,087,500? This would allow us both to walk away happy with the transaction.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
