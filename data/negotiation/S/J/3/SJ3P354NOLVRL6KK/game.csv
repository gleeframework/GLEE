"I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a more reasonable price.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Could you do $7,000? That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,000, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we discuss a price of $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $10,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to go up to $7,500.  That's a fair offer, and it would allow us to make a deal.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $9,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",9500.0,Alice,7,
