Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $10,250 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to come in a bit lower. How about we settle on $9,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's aiming for a price well below my minimum.  John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to haggle with Bob and potentially ending up with even less."
