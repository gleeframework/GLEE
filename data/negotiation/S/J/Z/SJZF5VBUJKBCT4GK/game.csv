"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $800000 just yet. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I'm eager to acquire this product, $850000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $825000.  This would represent a significant saving for you, and it's the highest I can realistically go at this time.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to go down to $825000. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $840000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something unique.",840000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $840000 is still a bit beyond what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $830000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. This is a fair price considering the potential savings for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",830000.0,Bob,6,

I'll offer it to you for $845000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something unique.
