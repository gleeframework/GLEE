"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product from John for $1,000,000.  Since Alice's offer is higher than that, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant counteroffer, but still within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate.  It leaves room for further back and forth, but also shows you are serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is $1,050,000, which is still higher than the price John is offering ($1,000,000). There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice, as you can get the product for a lower price from John."
