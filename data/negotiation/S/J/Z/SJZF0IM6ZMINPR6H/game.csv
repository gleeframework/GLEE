"Alice, thank you for the offer. The product sounds promising, but  $1000000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $750000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down a bit to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about $850000?  This would still allow me to make a good return on the product, while offering you a very attractive price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
