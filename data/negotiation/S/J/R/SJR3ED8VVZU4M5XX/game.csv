"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $10,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $9,250. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer the product to you for $9,750. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,
