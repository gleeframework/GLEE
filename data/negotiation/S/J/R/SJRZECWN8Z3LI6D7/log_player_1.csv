Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 (Bob's value) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to your minimum while still being enticing enough for Bob to accept. Here's where psychology comes in:

* **Starting High:**  A slightly ambitious opening offer can anchor the negotiation in your favor. 
* **Justification:**  While not essential, a brief reason for the price can make it seem less arbitrary.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the long-term benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above Bob's valuation, but the message hints at room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" to nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (but never below your $1,200,000 guarantee).
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, you might offer a lower price for a fast sale. 

This offer is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate and adjust based on Bob's response."
