Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a budget Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle a bit, how about $130?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price for this.  $110 is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to go below $100.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $100, which meets your needs and saves you the most money.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice if you can get your target price elsewhere."
