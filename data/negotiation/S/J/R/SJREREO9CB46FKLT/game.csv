"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of similar products. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering the value we both see in this product. I'm open to further discussion if you have any other thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value we both agree on the product. I'm open to further discussion if you have any other thoughts.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $887,500 for the product. This would give us both a fair profit while ensuring a mutually beneficial deal. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",887500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go below $915,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing a new offer of $910,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account both our interests.",910000.0,Alice,5,
