"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of similar products. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above her value ($800,000) but below your maximum ($1,200,000).**  This means there's room for negotiation. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price.** You have no downside to rejecting since you can always buy from John as a fallback."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.

I'm open to further discussion if you have any other thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value we both agree on the product. I'm open to further discussion if you have any other thoughts.

* **Alice's offer is still above her value ($800,000) but closer to your maximum ($1,200,000).** There's still room to negotiate.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to continue to try and get a better price.** You have no downside to rejecting since you can always buy from John. 
* **A counteroffer is likely to be successful as Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.**"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go below $915,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing a new offer of $910,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above her value ($800,000) but significantly closer to your desired price than John's offer ($1,200,000).**
* **The negotiation has reached a point where further counteroffers might lead to a stalemate or the risk of Alice walking away.**  Accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a good price without further negotiation. 
* **You have already saved a significant amount compared to John's offer.** It's unlikely you'll be able to get a significantly lower price without a lot more negotiation and risk."
