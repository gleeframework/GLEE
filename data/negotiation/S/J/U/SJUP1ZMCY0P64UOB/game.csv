"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested, but $125 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $112.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable with going below $120. It's a good price for both of us, and it's still well within what I need to get for the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'm willing to meet you at $115. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $115 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $117.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise.  Let me know what you think.",117.5,Alice,7,

I'm not sure I can go any higher than $112. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?,112.0,Bob,8,
