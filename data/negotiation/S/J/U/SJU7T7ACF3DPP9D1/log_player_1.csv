"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a good deal.
* **Emphasize Value:** My message highlights the perceived value of the product, making the price seem more justifiable. 
* **Leave Room for Counteroffers:** This price is still within the range that Bob might consider, giving him an incentive to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a fallback option, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still a significant amount below my initial offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I have 8 rounds remaining, and I believe there's room for Bob to increase his offer.
* **John's Offer is a Strong Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** I'm reducing my price by $100,000, showing flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit margin.
* **Positive Tone:** My message remains positive and emphasizes a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Maintain Incentive:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer again, as I believe he's genuinely interested in the product. 
* **John's Safety Net:**  Remember, John is still waiting if this deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it's still below that threshold.
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:** We're in the middle of a back-and-forth negotiation.  There's still room for Bob to increase his offer, and I'm confident he's interested in the product.
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:**  I know I can secure $1,000,000 from John if this deal falls apart, which allows me to be more patient with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a substantial offer, and it reflects the true value of this product. Let's make this deal work!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making another concession, reducing my price by $50,000, showing continued willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price and reinforce its importance to Bob.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  $1,050,000 is still above my minimum and John's offer, giving me bargaining power. 
* **Urgency:**  The message conveys a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it's still below that threshold.  I'm hesitant to continue negotiating since it's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Limited Rounds Left:** We have only 4 rounds left, and there's a risk that the negotiation will stall, leaving me with less than my minimum.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John is a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, which is a higher price than Bob is offering.  It's better to secure this deal now than to risk a lower price or a failed negotiation."
