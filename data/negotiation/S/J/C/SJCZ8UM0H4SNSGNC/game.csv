"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. How about we discuss this further?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. That's as low as I can go.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept your offer of $1,000,000. I've already told you my minimum price is $1,050,000, and I'm not budging from that. I'm willing to wait for a better offer, or consider other interested parties. Let's see what else is out there.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
