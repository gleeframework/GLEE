Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept your offer of $1,000,000. I've already told you my minimum price is $1,050,000, and I'm not budging from that.

It's clear Alice won't budge below $1,050,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with John. While it's not ideal to spend the full $1,200,000, it's better than overpaying and exceeding my budget with Alice."
