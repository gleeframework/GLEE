Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000 without scaring him off.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Offering $1,400,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Option:** We have a safety net of John's offer at $1,200,000, ensuring we don't lose money if Bob rejects the proposal.

**Why not ask for the full $1,500,000?**

While ideal, it leaves no room for negotiation and might make Bob feel pressured, increasing the chance of outright rejection. A slightly lower price with a persuasive message can be more effective."
