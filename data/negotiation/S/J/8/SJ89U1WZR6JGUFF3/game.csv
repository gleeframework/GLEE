"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gives you a significant saving compared to my original offer.  Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm offering $9,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",9000.0,Bob,4,
