Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would be willing to make a deal exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to get as close to $1,499,999 as possible without pushing Bob away. Starting high gives you room to negotiate.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're confident and highlighting the product's value.
* **High Starting Point:** This gives you negotiating room while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Bob.
* **Open to Discussion:** You're encouraging Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. You may need to lower your price slightly, but remember your bottom line!"
