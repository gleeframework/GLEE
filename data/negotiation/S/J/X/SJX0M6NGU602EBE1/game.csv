"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.,115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable going down to $115, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $115. How about $120.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",120.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $120.50. Would you be willing to go down to $118?",118.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go down to $118, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another small concession. How about $122? It's getting close to your original offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",122.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $122 is the best price for the product. Would you be willing to go down to $119?,119.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go down to $119, Bob. I think I've been very flexible, and I'm not willing to give up too much more. How about $123? It's still a fair price for the product, and I think it's a good compromise.",123.0,Alice,9,
