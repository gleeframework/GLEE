Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but still allows me to make a profit.
* **Message:** I've kept the message friendly and encouraging, highlighting the potential benefit for Bob. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By starting at $10,000, I leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better price. If Bob rejects, I can use John's $12,000 offer as leverage in my counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round. I'll use John's $12,000 offer as leverage to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've increased the price slightly to $9,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains some leverage.
* **Message:** I've acknowledged Bob's offer and highlighted the fairness of my counteroffer, emphasizing a win-win scenario.
* **Strategy:** By counter-offering at $9,500, I am hoping to find a middle ground while still benefiting from a good price. If Bob rejects, I can consider John's offer or further reduce the price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9200. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,200 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's still not ideal, accepting his offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid the risk of further negotiation or a potential rejection, which could lead me to sell to John at $12,000. I'm confident I can make a profit with this offer."
