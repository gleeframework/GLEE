"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer,  $14,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $15,500. That way we both get a fair price. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I really want to make this work, but $14,200 just doesn't cut it for me. Let's try to find a happy medium. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
