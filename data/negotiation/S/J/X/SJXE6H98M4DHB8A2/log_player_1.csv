Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's enticing but still profitable.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will pay $12,000 provides a strong fallback position.

**The offer:**  $11,500 is a compelling price point. It offers Bob a significant discount compared to Alice's minimum, while still securing a $1,500 profit for Alice if Bob accepts."
