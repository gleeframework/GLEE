"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum price of $15,000. Accepting this offer means saving $2,500, which is a good outcome for you. There's no reason to risk a counteroffer and potentially end up paying more or losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether."
