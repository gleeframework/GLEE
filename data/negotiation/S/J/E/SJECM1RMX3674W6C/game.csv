"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. This reflects the unique value and potential it holds. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while also allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still allows for a reasonable profit margin for me.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,600,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves you with a substantial profit. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
