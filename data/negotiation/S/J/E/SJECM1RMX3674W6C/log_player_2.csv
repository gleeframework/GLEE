This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,600,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's a possibility that Alice might be willing to come down further. If the negotiation stalls, Bob can always opt to buy from John for $1,500,000."
