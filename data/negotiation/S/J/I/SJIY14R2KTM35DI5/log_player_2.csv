**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down, she's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than John's $10,000 offer.  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, but at this stage, every dollar saved is a win.  It's not worth the risk of Alice digging in her heels and the negotiations stalling.  John offers a sure thing at a good price."
