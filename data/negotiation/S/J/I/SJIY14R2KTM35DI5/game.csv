"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle at $12,000? That's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to go below $13,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you say that's your final offer, but I'm finding it hard to meet you there.  $12,500 is the highest I can go.  What do you say?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my last offer before considering other options.",13000.0,Alice,7,
