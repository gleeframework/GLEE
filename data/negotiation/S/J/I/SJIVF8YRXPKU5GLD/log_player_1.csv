Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value for Bob, not just focusing on the price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message implies I'm open to discussing the price. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will tell me if he's willing to pay anything close to my starting price.
* **Set a high baseline:**  Starting high gives me more room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Keep John as a fallback option:** If Bob doesn't bite, I can always sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Difference:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my preferred range, and I'm not yet desperate enough to accept.
* **Negotiation Power:** Bob has shown interest by making a counteroffer, so I have leverage to try for a higher price. 
* **John as Backup:** I still have John as a safe option if negotiations with Bob fall through.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price, aiming to close the gap between our expectations. This shows that I'm serious about getting a fair price but am also open to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great product, and I think it's worth it for you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a slight concession, showing flexibility while still being above Bob's initial offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I remind Bob of the product's worth, hoping to justify the higher price.
* **Open Invitation:** My message leaves the door open for further discussion.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the Gap:**  It's a compromise that hopefully makes Bob more willing to negotiate.
* **Test the Waters:** Bob's response will reveal his level of commitment to buying the product.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm still keeping John as my backup option,  which strengthens my bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose $92 as my maximum offer for the product. Thank you for considering my request. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer is only $3 away from my minimum.
* **Risk of Losing Out:** If I reject, there's a chance Bob will walk away completely.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might be time-consuming and may not lead to a significantly better outcome.

**Strategy:**

This is a strategic decision:

* **Maximize Profit:**  $92 is a decent price considering the negotiation process and Bob's initial reluctance.
* **Minimize Risk:**  Accepting avoids the risk of losing a sale altogether.
* **Future Dealings:**  A successful transaction with Bob might lead to future sales opportunities."
