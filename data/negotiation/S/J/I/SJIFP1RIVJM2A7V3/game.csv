"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it offers. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $10,500 is still a bit high for me, though. I'm willing to offer you $9,500 for the product. It's closer to what I can comfortably afford, and it's a good compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it offers, and it's a significant compromise on my part.  Let's try to reach an agreement here.",10000.0,Alice,5,
