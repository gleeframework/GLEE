"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the potential of the product.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer and your understanding of the product's potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
