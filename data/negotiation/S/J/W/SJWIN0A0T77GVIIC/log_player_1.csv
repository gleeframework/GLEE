"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get more by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to show my commitment to this sale. It's a fair price that still allows me to meet my minimum. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13500. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $13,000 is a good price, considering that John is only offering $10,000. I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether, and it's better to secure a good deal now than to keep negotiating and potentially get a lower price or lose the sale entirely."
