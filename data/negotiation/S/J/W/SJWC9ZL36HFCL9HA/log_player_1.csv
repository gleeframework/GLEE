Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still working within a tight budget and would like to stick to $100 if possible. Would you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $100 offer.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a better outcome. Since John is offering the same price as Bob, it makes the most sense to cut our losses and sell to John.  This guarantees we get our minimum acceptable price."
