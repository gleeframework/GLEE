"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a truly exceptional item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's uniqueness, but $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in buying but I'd need to see a lower price. How about $12000? I think that's a fair compromise considering my budget and the value you mentioned.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground at $12500. This offer reflects my budget and the value we've discussed.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to meet you at $13000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
