"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and still well above my minimum asking price. Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product to you, and it's closer to my desired price point.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $1,275,000? I'm getting closer to my target, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,275,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we compromise at $1,300,000? That's closer to my desired price, and it's still a very good deal for you, given the value you place on the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. How about we try $1,275,000 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. Let's try $1,290,000. This is a fair compromise that allows me to make a profit while still offering you a great deal. I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $1,290,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $1,280,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1280000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $1,280,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $1,285,000. This is a very fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal. What do you say?",1285000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to make one final offer. I'm willing to pay $1,280,000, but I need you to meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,500,000. This is my last offer.",1280000.0,Bob,10,
