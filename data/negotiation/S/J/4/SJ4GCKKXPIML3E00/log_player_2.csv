"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  It's a significant discount from my usual asking price, and it's still well above your estimated value. Let me know what you think.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to sell for $850,000. This still offers you a good deal, as it's well below my usual price. Let's see if we can find common ground here.
