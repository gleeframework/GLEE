"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1500000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price point. It's unlikely Alice will budge much from her opening offer, so it's worth trying to negotiate.  

By rejecting, you signal that you're willing to walk away. This puts pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the potential value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This seems like a fair price considering your own stated valuation, and it provides you with a healthy profit."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is a tempting offer, it's a bit lower than I'm willing to accept at this stage. However, I'm still open to a deal. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which reflects a significant compromise on my end. This would still provide you with a great value, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your acceptable range:**  Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for you and within your budget. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** You've already made a counteroffer, and Alice rejected it.  It's unlikely she'll come down further, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **John's price is a benchmark:** You can always buy from John for $1,500,000, so this offer provides a solid alternative if you're not satisfied with Alice's final offer. 

By accepting Alice's offer, you secure a good deal while avoiding potential risks of a protracted negotiation or losing the opportunity altogether."
