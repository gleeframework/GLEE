"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1500000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the potential value to me, I'm willing to pay $1200000. This seems like a fair price considering your own stated valuation, and it provides you with a healthy profit.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is a tempting offer, it's a bit lower than I'm willing to accept at this stage. However, I'm still open to a deal. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which reflects a significant compromise on my end. This would still provide you with a great value, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
