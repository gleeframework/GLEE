Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a truly unique opportunity to acquire a product worth far more than its monetary value. I'm confident this will be a game-changer for you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant amount, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is designed to be enticing and highlight the potential value of the product without revealing too much information. 
* **Strategic Approach:** I'm setting a high initial price to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to negotiate. If he's not willing to pay close to my asking price, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be significant beyond its price tag. However, considering my budget constraints, I am proposing an offer of $1000000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, it's important to remember that:

* **My minimum value is $1,000,000:** Accepting Bob's offer would be a loss for me.
* **I have a backup option:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000.
* **Potential for higher price:** There's a chance that Bob is genuinely interested and may be willing to increase his offer if I reject his current one.

Therefore, it's better to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I can try to get a better price from Bob or simply sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but it's a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be sure I'm getting a fair value for this product. I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm presenting a counteroffer that's halfway between my initial offer ($1,500,000) and Bob's offer ($1,000,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a higher price than Bob's current offer.
* **Fair Value:** The message focuses on the ""fair value"" of the product, subtly reinforcing the idea that my price is justified.
* **Positive Tone:**  The tone of the message remains friendly and encouraging, suggesting a desire to reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm open to negotiation but also that I'm not willing to settle for his initial low offer. This can lead to further discussion and potentially a higher price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the current market conditions and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1100000 for the product. I believe this offers a good balance between value and cost for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired value.  Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  There's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can push for a higher price.
* **Value of the Product:**  I believe the product is worth more than $1,100,000.  
* **Selling to John is a Guarantee:**  Selling to John ensures me $1,000,000. If I don't get a better offer from Bob, I can always go with John.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate for a sale and I'm willing to continue the negotiation process.  This might encourage Bob to raise his offer or make me a counteroffer that is closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope it's a price we can agree on."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but this time only by a smaller amount than before. This shows that I'm serious about finding a compromise but also that I'm not willing to give away too much.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially leading to a more positive response. 
* **Final Offer:** I'm setting this as a potential final offer, suggesting that I'm nearing my limit on concessions.

**Strategy:**

By making a smaller adjustment and emphasizing fairness, I'm aiming to put pressure on Bob to consider my final offer. I'm confident that $1,150,000 is a reasonable price, and I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept."
