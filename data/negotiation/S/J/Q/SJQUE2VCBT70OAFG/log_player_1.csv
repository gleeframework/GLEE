"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,600,000 is a significant amount, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $1,800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,700,000, which is still above Bob's offer but shows my willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is only $50,000 less than my previous counteroffer, and it's getting closer to my desired price. Considering I have only 6 rounds remaining, accepting this offer seems like the best option."
