"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, so I'm offering it to you for a price that's fair to both of us: $11,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

``` 

Alice's offer is a bit high. You know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially propose a better deal or you can fall back on buying from John."
