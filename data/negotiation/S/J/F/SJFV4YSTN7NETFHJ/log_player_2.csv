"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $10,000 to you,  Alice's offer of $12,000 is too high.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my budget and leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to find a price that's fair to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget of $10,000. I will continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to find a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $9,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it might be enough to convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my maximum budget. Although I'm willing to negotiate, it seems unlikely Alice will go lower than $10,000. It's more efficient to purchase the product from John for $10,000 to ensure I get the best price within my budget."
