"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's worth a lot to you, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  My starting price is $1,200,000.  Let's talk!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my value for it and your bottom line.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my original price, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product.  I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my minimum acceptable offer. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find common ground.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 still doesn't reflect the value of this product for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,012,500.  This is a fair compromise, considering your stated value and my own minimum. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer, but $1,012,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $990,000. This is a fair price considering my value and your minimum.  Let's settle on this and finalize the deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $990,000 doesn't quite capture the full value of this product for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering your stated value and my bottom line.  Let's settle this now and finalize the deal. ",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and finalize the deal at $995,000. This is a fair price considering our previous negotiations, and it allows both of us to walk away with a good outcome. What do you say?",995000.0,Bob,8,
