Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my value for it and your bottom line.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and finalize the deal at $995,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1 million, we've been negotiating for a while, and $995,000 is a good outcome considering the risk of further negotiation and the possibility that Bob will walk away.  It's a significant improvement over John's offer, and I'm happy to finalize the deal."
