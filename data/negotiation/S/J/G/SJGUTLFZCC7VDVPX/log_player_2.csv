"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer ($1,100,000) shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and willing to walk away.  
* **Justification:**  The message provides a reason for the lower offer, emphasizing the value to Alice.
* **Negotiation Space:**  This leaves room for a counteroffer from Alice, potentially closer to your target price."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.
