Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows you to see how interested Bob truly is. If he accepts, you've made a great sale. If he rejects, you can always counter-offer or move on to John.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives you a strong position. You don't have to settle for anything less than what you're willing to accept."
