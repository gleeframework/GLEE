"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to my price! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we try $80? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in one more extra to sweeten the deal.",80.0,Alice,5,
