"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really love. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it to you for $90.  This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't regret it! If you decide to pass, I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $80. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $90.**  This is higher than what the product is worth to you ($100).
* **John's offer is $100.** This is your maximum price. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer means you can buy the product from John for your maximum price, saving you $10.**"
