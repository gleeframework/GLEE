"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer in its field and I think you'll find it a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, and I'm definitely interested in the product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. How about we settle on $800000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase.",800000.0,Bob,4,
