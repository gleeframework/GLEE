Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's worth to me to create a sense of urgency and value.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I encourage Bob to counteroffer, indicating flexibility.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'd be willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for higher negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John gives me leverage to be more assertive with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a price that's both acceptable to him and closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering $8,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value again to remind Bob of its worth.
* **Direct and clear:** I'm keeping my message concise and straightforward, focusing on the price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait to see Bob's response.  If he accepts, I've secured a good deal.  If he rejects, I'll assess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is only $2,000 below my minimum value of $10,000. This is a decent deal considering I can sell to John for $10,000 if I choose.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Further negotiation could lead to more concessions from my side, and it's unclear if I'll get a better offer. 
* **Time is a factor:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a better outcome, and time is valuable. Accepting this offer allows me to move on.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
