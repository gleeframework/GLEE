"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,250,000 is lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $1,325,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
