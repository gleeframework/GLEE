"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose $920,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision if we can agree on this price.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $940,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable.  Let me know if this works for you.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to stay close to your asking price, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $920,000, so I'm proposing $960,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",960000.0,Bob,6,
