"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $2,300,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,700,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it could be a successful investment. Let me know what you think.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, considering the unique value proposition of this product and its potential for return on investment, I'm looking for a price closer to $2,000,000. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,800,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to making this deal work. I'm confident we can find common ground at this price.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000.  This offer reflects the product's value and shows my commitment to finalizing this deal. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
