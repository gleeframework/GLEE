"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While $115 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? That's still a good price for me, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Alice's offer of $110 is within your budget and saves you $10 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal, and you should accept it."
