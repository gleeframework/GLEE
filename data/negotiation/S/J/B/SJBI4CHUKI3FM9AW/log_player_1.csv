{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation if necessary.  It also frames the message in a way that highlights the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm willing to try and get a bit more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? That's still a good price for me, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 110}
