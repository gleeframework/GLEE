"I understand your position, Alice. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1,375,000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1,325,000. I hope this is acceptable, as I am keen to acquire the product at a price that aligns with my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,325,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise.  Let's split the difference and close this deal at $1,350,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
