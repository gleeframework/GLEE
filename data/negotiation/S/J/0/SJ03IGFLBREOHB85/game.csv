"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I believe it's a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  $95 is the highest I can go.  What do you say?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $95 still isn't quite right for me.  Let's compromise at $100. This way, we both get a fair deal, and I can avoid selling to John.",100.0,Alice,5,
