"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This would allow me to earn a fair price while still giving you a great value.  Let's make this deal happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we go with $10,750? This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
