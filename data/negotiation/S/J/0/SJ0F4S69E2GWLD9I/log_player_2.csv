"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to Bob, and John is willing to sell it for $120, there is no benefit to negotiating with Alice. Buying from John guarantees the product at the maximum acceptable price."
