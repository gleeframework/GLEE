"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **You value the product at $150**, so $140 is a decent price but not the best. 
* **You want to save as much money as possible**, and there's room to negotiate. 
* **There are 9 more rounds**, giving you time to see if you can get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer was $140**, and you want to save money.
* **You're willing to pay $150** for the product, so $120 is a significant discount.
* **This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point** and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $130**, which is within your budget and closer to your desired price.
* **You've already rejected one offer**, so there's a chance you might not get a better deal. 
* **Buying from John for $150 is still an option**, but you're likely to save more money by accepting Alice's offer.
* **You're willing to pay $150**, so this offer is a good compromise."
