Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $9,000? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am still interested in the product and am willing to pay $8,750 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $8,750 is a good deal. It's significantly more than my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further haggling."
