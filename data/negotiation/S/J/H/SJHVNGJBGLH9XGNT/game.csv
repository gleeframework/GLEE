"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair offer. How about $140?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground here. I'll consider your offer, but I need to stick to my minimum price of $140. Can we meet somewhere in this range?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  I'm willing to go a bit higher but $140 is still a bit steep.  Let's split the difference and go with $135. This way we both save some money and can close the deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your proposal. I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $137.50? This would be a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  However, $137.50 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay at this time. I'm willing to go up to $132.50, which is a fair compromise and still leaves some room for both of us to make a deal.",132.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm almost there, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  How about we meet at $130?  It's a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do right now.",130.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I believe $132.50 is a reasonable price. This allows for a fair transaction while respecting our respective valuations.",132.5,Alice,9,
