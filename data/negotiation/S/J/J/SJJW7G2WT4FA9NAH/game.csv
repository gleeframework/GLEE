"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm now offering it to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,500, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still a fair deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",12500.0,Alice,5,
