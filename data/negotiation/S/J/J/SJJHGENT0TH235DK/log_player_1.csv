Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $1,000,000 is a significant starting point, leaving room for negotiation. It's above Bob's perceived value but still less than what I would get from John.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and highlights the value to Bob, increasing the chances of a positive response. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:** I'm open to negotiation, but I won't go below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me leverage and allows me to be more aggressive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $950,000 for your product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value.  
* **Leverage:** Knowing I can sell to John for a higher price gives me the power to push for a better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $980,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Negotiation:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a margin above my minimum. 
* **Fairness & Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the new price, appealing to Bob's sense of compromise. 

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Leverage:**  By staying firm on my minimum, I maintain leverage in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I am still looking to keep the cost below $1 million. I am willing to pay $970,000 for your product. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Value:**  Bob's offer of $970,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $980,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away, and I might end up having to sell to John for a lower profit. 

**Strategy:**

* **Accepting the Offer:**  In this scenario, it's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer. I'm getting close to my desired value, and the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high."
