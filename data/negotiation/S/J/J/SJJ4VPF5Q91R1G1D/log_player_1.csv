Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you and I'm confident it's worth at least $800,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $875,000.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 875000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high.  
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $75,000 markup is significant but not outrageous. It gives you room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value helps justify the price. 
* **Clear Call to Action:** Directly asking for Bob's thoughts encourages a response and keeps the negotiation moving.

It's important to remember that this is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters or seems hesitant.  You can always lower your price slightly, but you can't go back up once an offer is made."
