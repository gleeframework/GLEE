"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the outset. You have no information about the product's value to her, so it's worth exploring if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $500,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. This establishes a clear starting point for negotiation, and it's a price that still allows for room to compromise. 

It's important to remember that you have no information about Alice's ideal selling price. This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $900,000 is still quite high. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price.  You have several rounds left, and the potential for a better deal is still there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's current offer. It demonstrates that you are willing to negotiate and meet her halfway, but still aims for a price lower than her offer. This shows you are serious about buying the product but also about finding a deal that benefits both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to lower her price, $850,000 is still a significant amount of money, and there's still room for negotiation. There are five rounds left, and it's likely Alice may be willing to come down further to secure the sale. It's worth trying to push for a better price before potentially accepting this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise further while still aiming for a lower price.  By offering $750,000, you are only $100,000 away from Alice's offer, indicating that you are serious about buying the product. However, it's a price that still offers you a substantial discount from her original offer and may push her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now only $25,000 away from your last counteroffer. It's unlikely that Alice will lower her price further, and continuing to negotiate would risk losing the deal. With only three rounds remaining, accepting the offer for $825,000 is a good outcome, saving you a significant amount of money compared to John's offer.  You've demonstrated your commitment to negotiating a fair price, and this offer allows you to secure the product without risking losing it."
