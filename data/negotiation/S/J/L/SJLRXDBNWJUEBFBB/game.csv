"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference and go with $115?  This still leaves you with a great deal on a valuable product. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $115. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",112.0,Bob,4,
