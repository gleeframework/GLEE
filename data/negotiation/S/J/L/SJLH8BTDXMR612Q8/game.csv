"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $145. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $130 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $140? It's closer to your offer, but it also allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $140. How about we meet at $135?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $135 is still a bit below my acceptable range. Let's split the difference again - how about $137.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",137.5,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $137.50. How about we meet at $132.50?",132.5,Bob,8,
