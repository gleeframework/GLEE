Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** Bob knows the product is worth $12,000 to him, so he's likely to counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I can still lower the price slightly or use John as leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $8,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I can still try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John as leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 gives me a strong bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a good deal for you, considering what the product is worth, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:**  $8,500 is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Highlight the value:**  I emphasize the value of the product to Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still using John as leverage in the background, even if I don't explicitly mention him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still finding it a little steep.  How about we split the difference and meet at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum price.
* **No further negotiation needed:**  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale.
* **Equal value:**  While I could potentially negotiate a bit higher, accepting this offer ensures I get my minimum and Bob gets a good deal."
