,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,600,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still not quite there. Let's try $1,450,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $1,400,000? That's a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
