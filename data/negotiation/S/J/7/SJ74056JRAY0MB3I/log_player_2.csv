"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to secure a lower price, potentially saving even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and still allows Bob to make a profit.  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting a counteroffer and potentially leading to a higher price from John outweighs the potential savings.  It's a smart move for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
