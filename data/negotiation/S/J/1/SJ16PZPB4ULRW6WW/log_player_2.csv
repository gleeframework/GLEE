"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is below your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with John if necessary."
