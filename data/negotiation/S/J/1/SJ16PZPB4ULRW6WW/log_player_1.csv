Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Information Asymmetry:**  Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000. This is your leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a subtle pressure point.
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""exceptional value and potential"" reinforces the price without being overly aggressive.
* **""Fair Deal"":**  Framing it as mutually beneficial increases the chance of acceptance.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 leaves you with a significant profit margin while staying attractive to Bob (who saves $150,000 from his perceived value).

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. You may need to adjust your offer based on Bob's response and any counteroffers he makes."
