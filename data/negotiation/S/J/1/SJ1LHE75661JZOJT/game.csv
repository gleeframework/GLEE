"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9500 is still a little too low for me. How about we settle on $10500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9800 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  To finalize this deal, how about we meet in the middle at $10150? This would allow both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?",10150.0,Alice,5,
