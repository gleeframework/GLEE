{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value to you, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider letting me purchase it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get a little closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I let it go for $110?  That way we both come away happy."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
