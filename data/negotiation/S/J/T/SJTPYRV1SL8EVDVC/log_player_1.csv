Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, which is important to avoid immediately shutting down the conversation.

This strategy is a balance between trying to get a good price while still being open to negotiation to hopefully close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I have no reason to believe I can get a better offer from him.  Selling to John would result in the same outcome, and continuing to negotiate carries the risk of losing the sale altogether."
