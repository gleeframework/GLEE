,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $140? It's still a fair price for you and within my budget.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $160? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's split the difference and go with $155. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $155. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $165? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's worth it.",165.0,Alice,5,
