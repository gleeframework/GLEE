"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $11,000 for the product.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming to get the best possible value for this product, and I'd be happy to move forward with a price of $10,500. This would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. This price still represents a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll take it for $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $11,250 is a more reasonable price for the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it's a fair offer, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000.",11250.0,Alice,5,
