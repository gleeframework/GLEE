Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher final price. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives you leverage. You're not pressured to accept any offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While it's a step in the right direction, you have room to negotiate further. You know you have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000, so there's no need to settle for less than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a respectable offer, the product's value justifies a higher price point. I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000.  This offer reflects a more accurate valuation."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I significantly decreased my asking price from $1,450,000 to $1,300,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Above Minimum:** This counteroffer still keeps me well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (John's offer) and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""accurate valuation,"" I subtly remind Bob of the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This offer represents a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my price range, his current offer of $1,150,000 is still below my guaranteed sale price from John ($1,200,000). It's unlikely Bob will meet or exceed John's offer at this point.  Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to cut off negotiations with Bob and sell to John."
