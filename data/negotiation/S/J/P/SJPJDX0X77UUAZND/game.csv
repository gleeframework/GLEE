"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a respectable offer, the product's value justifies a higher price point. I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000.  This offer reflects a more accurate valuation.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This offer represents a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
