Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm starting with a price of $18,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($15,000) but not too far off. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that's beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value ($15,000).  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is just too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $16,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
