"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is within your budget, it's still a significant amount.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's $100,000 less than Alice's initial price. This is a reasonable starting point that shows I'm serious about buying the product but also want a fair price. It's also still significantly lower than John's offer, giving me some room to maneuver."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not willing to accept a price that's only $50,000 less than her initial offer.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,320,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,320,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still holding firm on getting a good price. It's a reasonable compromise between our previous offers and could lead to a successful agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my previous counteroffer. This suggests she is getting closer to my price range.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice walking away altogether is increasing. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product within my budget while saving a significant amount compared to John's offer."
