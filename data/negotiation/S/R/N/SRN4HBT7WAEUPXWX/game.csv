"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you'll be getting it at a significant discount from its true value, and I'll be getting a good price for it. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's make this happen!",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  I'm getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still a little too steep for me. Would you consider $1,150,000? That's a significant price jump on my end, and I think it's a fair offer.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $1,150,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about $1,175,000?  I think that's a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
