"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $130. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",130.0,Alice,5,
