{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer allows for a decent profit for Alice while still leaving room for negotiation.  The price is significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob, making it an attractive offer.  This strategy allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still protecting Alice's minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10000. This would still be a good profit for you, and it fits my budget better.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below Alice's ideal price point. By rejecting the offer, Alice can continue the negotiation and try to secure a better price.  She can counter with a price closer to her original offer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
