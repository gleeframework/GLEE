"Hi Bob, I understand that 90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for 82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $80?  That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than 85. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 80 and 85, so I can offer it to you for 82.50 again. This is my final offer.",82.5,Alice,5,
