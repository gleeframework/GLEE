Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, any amount above that is a profit. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a significantly higher offer ($18,000) gives room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still potentially settle closer to your minimum while exceeding John's offer.
* **Value Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your minimum price, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There are risks involved, such as Bob rejecting the offer outright.  You could adjust your starting price based on your risk tolerance and how much you believe Bob might be willing to pay."
