"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the product's value to you and the potential benefits it offers, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while ensuring a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $800,000.  To make it worth my while to go with your product, I'd need to get it closer to that price point. Would you be willing to consider $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
