I'll reject Bob's offer. $850,000 is too low for me. I'm still hoping to get closer to $1 million. I'll try to negotiate further."

I'm going to sell to John.  We're getting close to my minimum, but Bob's offers are still too far below what I'm comfortable with. It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially with John's offer."
