Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $95, which is higher than what Bob values the product at, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price allows for a few rounds of negotiation before I might need to consider John's offer.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging message helps build rapport and might make Bob more inclined to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $100. Bob's offer is below that. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While $85 is close to what Bob values the product, I believe I can still get a higher price by counter-offering.
* **John's Offer:** I'm not in a rush to sell, and John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90? That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm aiming for a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly and showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not taking a significant loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $85.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Another Counteroffer:** I believe I can still get a higher price by making another counteroffer. It seems like Bob is genuinely interested in the product, so there's room for further negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** I'm not in a rush to sell, and John's offer provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $87.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow me to make sure I get a good deal for this unique product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to My Ground:**  I'm sticking to $90 because it's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for a potential compromise.
* **Reframing the Offer:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price and highlighting the product's uniqueness to make it more appealing.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:**  I'm suggesting a compromise to encourage Bob to accept the offer before he might consider going elsewhere."
