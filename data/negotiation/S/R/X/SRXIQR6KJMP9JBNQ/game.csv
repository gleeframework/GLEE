"Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90? That gives us both a good deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $85.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $87.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow me to make sure I get a good deal for this unique product.",90.0,Alice,5,
