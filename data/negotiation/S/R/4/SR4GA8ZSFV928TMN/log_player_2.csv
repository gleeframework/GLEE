"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$120 is too high.**  You're aiming for a price below $150 and Alice's offer is already above that.
* **Counteroffers are possible.** You have 10 rounds and can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** A $100 offer is a significant drop from Alice's $120, showing you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** This offer still allows for potential negotiation and compromise in the remaining rounds. 
* **Keeps you below your limit:** $100 is well within your $150 budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:**  $110 is very close to your desired price range, and significantly lower than the initial offer. 
* **Risk of losing a good deal:** If you reject this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. You risk getting stuck with John's higher price.
* **Time is a factor:** You have fewer rounds left, so accepting this offer secures a good deal without risking further negotiation."
