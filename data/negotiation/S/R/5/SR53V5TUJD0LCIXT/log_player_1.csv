Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary. I want to see how interested Bob is in the product and gauge his willingness to pay.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to consider whether to make a counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn. Accepting his offer will allow me to make a decent profit."
