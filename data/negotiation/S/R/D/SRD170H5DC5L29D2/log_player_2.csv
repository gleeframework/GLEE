{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a bit high, considering I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000 and the product is worth $800,000 to her. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.
