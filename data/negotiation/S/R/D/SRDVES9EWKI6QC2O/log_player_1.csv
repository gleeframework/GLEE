Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the product's benefits and using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room:** This price allows for some negotiation without risking going below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer for $150 gives me confidence to push for a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested, but I'd be comfortable paying $90 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below the $130 I initially offered. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $150, so there's no need to settle for a lower price just yet.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer is too low to accept.  I can use this as an opportunity to see if I can get a better counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, and $90 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need to see $110 to make this work.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Maintain Value:** My counteroffer of $110 is a compromise from my previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate. However, it still keeps the price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer,  and above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Maintain Interest:**  I'm using positive language to keep Bob engaged and show that I'm open to finding a solution.
* **Setting a Limit:** I'm establishing a clear limit with the $110 counteroffer, giving Bob a specific price to consider.

**Goal:**

The goal of this counteroffer is to test Bob's willingness to pay closer to my value while still keeping the negotiation open and avoiding a premature sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $100?  That's the absolute most I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offer of $100 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:**  I have a secure buyer in John who is willing to pay $150.  This guarantees me a profit, which is more important than risking further negotiation with Bob.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  At this point, there's very little room for further negotiation.  Bob is at his maximum, and continuing to counteroffer might risk losing him altogether.

**Conclusion:**

To maximize my earnings and ensure a successful sale, it's best to accept John's offer and sell the product for $150.  While it's always tempting to try for a higher price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential gains."
