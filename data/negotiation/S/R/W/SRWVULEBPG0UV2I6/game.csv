"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to maximize my return on investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. I agree that the product looks promising, but I think $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to offer $700,000 to start the negotiations.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

Considering your offer of $700,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $800,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.
