"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is simply too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1200000 to make this work. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1150000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $1050000 is still too far below my minimum. While I'm willing to be flexible, I need to stay closer to $1150000 to make this work.
