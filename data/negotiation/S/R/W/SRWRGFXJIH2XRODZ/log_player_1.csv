Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120,  getting Bob to buy at a higher price increases your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's a chance Bob might reject $110, but the potential extra profit makes it a risk worth taking."
