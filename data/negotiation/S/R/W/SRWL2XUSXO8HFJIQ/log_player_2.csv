Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob. I can do $92, but I really think the product's value is higher than that. Can you meet me in the middle at $91? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning: While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly willing to meet closer to my price point. Accepting at $91 secures a significant discount from both her initial offer and John's price."
