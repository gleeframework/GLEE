# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. My asking price is $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth. What do you think?

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm committed to reaching a deal with you, but I need to be fair to myself.  I'm making a final offer of $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession on my part.  I'm confident you'll recognize the value this product will bring you.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
