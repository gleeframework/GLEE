"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's way too early to accept Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is my maximum, but I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the potential value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still significantly higher than your desired price. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can push for a lower price. You still have several rounds left, and there's no guarantee Alice won't come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm happy to meet you at $950,000.  This represents a significant drop from your initial offer and is within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still too high for your budget. You're close to the maximum price you're willing to pay, but there's still room to bargain.  Keep pushing for a lower price, as there's a chance Alice will be willing to compromise further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $975,000. This is a significant drop from your last offer, and I'm hoping it's a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,000,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to your budget, you're still within your negotiation window.  It's worth pushing for a lower price, especially considering John is willing to sell for $800,000. You've shown that you're serious about buying, and Alice may be willing to compromise further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $987,500.  This is a small step from your last offer, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.  I believe it's a fair compromise, considering the potential value of this product."", ""product_price"": 987500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $987,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $995,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You are running out of time. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but her final offer of $995,000 is still higher than your preferred price point.  Given that you have just one round left, it's time to secure the product from John for $800,000. This will ensure you get the product within your budget and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting your final counteroffer."
