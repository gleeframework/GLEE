"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20000 for it, which is a fair price considering its unique features and potential.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate its unique features, but I believe $8000 would be a fair price for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $17000, which still gives you a good price while being fair for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not able to meet at $17000. I would like to propose $14000 as a counteroffer. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest in the product, but $14000 is just below my minimum threshold. To make this work, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while considering your budget. I hope we can reach an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I would like to counter with $14000. This is the highest I can go while still making sure I'm getting a good deal for myself.",14000.0,Bob,6,
