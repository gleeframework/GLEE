"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I've done my research and I think it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $900,000 is a bit high.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $700,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the reply.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a ways off from that number.  How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still not satisfied with the price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to try to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $795,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",795000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's try to wrap this up, how about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $785,000, which is a compromise between our last two offers. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",785000.0,Alice,7,
