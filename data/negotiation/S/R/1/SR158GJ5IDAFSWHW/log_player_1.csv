Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob.  Starting at $12,000 allows room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** By mentioning ""other interest"" you create a sense of scarcity and value, potentially motivating Bob to pay more than his initial perceived value. 
* **Open Communication:**  The message invites Bob's feedback, opening the door for negotiation and allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially adjust your offer if needed."
