"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering my budget and the value I can get out of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that $1200000 is a bit below my initial asking price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This price still reflects the product's exceptional value, but it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1250000.

"I understand that $1250000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to reach an agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This price is closer to your budget, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the value I can get out of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
