"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I am only able to pay up to $150 for this product. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is offering the maximum he's willing to pay, which is still below my minimum. There's no point in further negotiation.  I'll take the guaranteed $150 from John."
