Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a bit more in line with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it. There's still room for negotiation, and I'd like to see if we can reach a more favorable price for me. I'll counteroffer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate that. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and it's only $20,000 below my previous offer. I don't want to risk losing the deal and ending up with John's offer, which is significantly lower. It's time to accept and finalize the sale."
