"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about we settle at $9,500?  This would be a great price for you, and still allows me to cover my costs.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to cover your costs, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I can only go as low as $9,250. Can you consider that?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $9,375.  This is a fair price for both of us and avoids us going back and forth further.",9375.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,375 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $9,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. I'm willing to walk away if it's not a good deal for me.",9000.0,Bob,8,
