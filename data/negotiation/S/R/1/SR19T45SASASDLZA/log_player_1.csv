{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's in excellent condition and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer gives me a $1,000 profit, but it also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for the guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,500. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I don't see a realistic path to getting closer to my desired price with him.  Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed way to get my minimum and avoid further negotiation."
