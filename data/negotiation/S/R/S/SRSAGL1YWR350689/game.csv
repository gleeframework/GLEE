,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me closer to my price range, Alice. How about $95?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $105? It's still a good deal for you, and it's getting closer to what I'm looking for.",105.0,Alice,5,
