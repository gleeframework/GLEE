"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product holds significant value for you, potentially even more than my minimum asking price. To make this a smooth transaction, I propose a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget ($1,000,000). While she believes the product has value for you, it's not worth the extra $500,000. You can get the same product from John for a much lower price, making it the more financially sound decision."
