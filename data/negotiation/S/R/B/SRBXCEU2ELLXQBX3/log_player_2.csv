**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems firm on $120.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll move much further. John's price of $150 is our safety net, and at this point, it's better to cut our losses and buy from John rather than risk Alice sticking to her price or walking away entirely."
