"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000.  I know it's worth $1,500,000 to you, so this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You can get the product for $1,450,000 from Alice, which is less than the $1,500,000 you'd pay John. 
* **Even though Alice claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, that's her perception.** You know your maximum is $1,500,000. 
* **Accepting the offer saves you $50,000.**"
