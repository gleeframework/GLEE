"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my final offer, let me know if we can make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $9,250. This is my final offer, let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,5,
