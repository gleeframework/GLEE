I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a starting point that gives me a good profit margin while still being within the range of what Bob is likely willing to pay. I'm confident in the value of my product and believe that I can secure a favorable deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is still a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still provides me with a decent profit while demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. It's also closer to my initial asking price,  showing that I'm not willing to go too far below my valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to secure a higher price, Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower offer is not worth it.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a fair and secure deal, and it's the best option at this point."
