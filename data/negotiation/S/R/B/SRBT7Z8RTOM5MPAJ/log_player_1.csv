We're still significantly below my minimum, and Bob's latest message suggests some wiggle room. I'll counter-offer again in round 5."

Bob is not moving significantly towards my minimum price. He's still trying to negotiate me down below $1.3M.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1.5M from John."
