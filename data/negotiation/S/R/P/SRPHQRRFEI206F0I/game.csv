"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but I think $1,400,000 is a bit high. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I believe this product's true value is closer to my initial proposal.  Would you consider $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
