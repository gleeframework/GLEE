"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that $12,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,000. Is that a price you'd be comfortable with?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference again is a great compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the original offer, but I need to make a profit. Is $17,000 a price you'd be willing to consider?",17000.0,Alice,5,
