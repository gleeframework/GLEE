"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you is $10000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $14500. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $14500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $13000. Can we discuss further?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to drive the price down, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $13250. Can we discuss further?",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $13750. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",13750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $13750. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $13375. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",13375.0,Bob,8,
