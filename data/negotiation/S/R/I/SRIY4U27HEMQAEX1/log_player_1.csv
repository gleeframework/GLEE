Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay even slightly more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential ""loss aversion"" for Bob. He might feel like he's getting a deal compared to your alternative. 
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed politely and leaves room for negotiation, although limited, given your backup offer. 

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still keeping the deal attractive enough for him to accept."
