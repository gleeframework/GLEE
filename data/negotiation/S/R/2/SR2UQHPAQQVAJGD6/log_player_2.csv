"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $850,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  To be frank, I have another potential buyer lined up for a price closer to my initial ask.  If you're serious about purchasing, would you be willing to consider $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise to get us moving towards a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Alice's offer is still too high. While $1,900,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still far more than your budget allows. You should reject the offer and counteroffer again."

I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, and I understand you're making a genuine effort. However, the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.  Would you be willing to consider $1,600,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still beyond your budget.  While she's shown some flexibility, it's clear that you're unlikely to reach an agreement.  Therefore, it's best to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $800,000. This ensures you get the product within your budget."
