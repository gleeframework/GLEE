Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know Bob values the product at ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $9,500 allows for some wiggle room for counteroffers. It's likely Bob will counter, and we can settle somewhere in between.
* **Avoiding John's Deal:** I'm aiming to maximize my profit, so I don't want to immediately jump to John's $10,000 offer unless I have to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  $8,500 is below my $10,000 floor.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  Even though John offers $10,000, I want to see if I can get closer to that amount with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $8,500 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'd be willing to accept $9,000 for it.  This would still leave some room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** By lowering my price slightly, I'm showing flexibility while still securing a price above my minimum. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** The message encourages further negotiation, leaving the door open for a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $8,750 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk him walking away entirely, forcing me to sell to John at $10,000. 
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation might take time, and John's offer is always on the table. It's a good time to take a deal that's close to my target."
