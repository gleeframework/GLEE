"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $950,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business.  This price reflects the true worth of the product while giving you a significant advantage.  I understand you have other options, but I'm confident this is a deal you won't want to miss. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can leverage John's lower price to negotiate a better deal or secure the product at the lower price point."
