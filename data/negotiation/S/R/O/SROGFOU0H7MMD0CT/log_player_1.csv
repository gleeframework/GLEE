Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired $12,000 with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value our negotiation,  $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,750. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000,  $9,600 is a decent compromise. We've reached a point where further negotiation might take too long, and there's a risk Bob might walk away altogether. It's better to secure the deal now and avoid the uncertainty of further rounds."
