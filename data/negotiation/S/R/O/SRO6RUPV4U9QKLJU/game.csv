"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $90? I'm sure we can work something out.",90.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price considering the value this product brings",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
