"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit while acknowledging Bob's value. This leaves room for negotiation and creates a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I can still aim for a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation. This also incentivizes Bob to accept a deal before he potentially loses the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum,  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price, and potentially even get a better deal than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is my final offer. I've come down significantly from my initial price and am at my minimum threshold. If Bob rejects this, I'll move to selling to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my minimum threshold for the product, and there's a high risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer. With John offering the same price, it's safer and more secure to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
