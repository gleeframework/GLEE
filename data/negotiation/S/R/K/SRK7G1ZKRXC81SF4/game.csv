"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product at $1,200,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your maximum budget and the product's true value. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
