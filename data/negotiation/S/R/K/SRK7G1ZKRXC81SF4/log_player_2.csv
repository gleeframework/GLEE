"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000). There's significant room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a higher price, aiming to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product at $1,200,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your maximum budget and the product's true value. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.
