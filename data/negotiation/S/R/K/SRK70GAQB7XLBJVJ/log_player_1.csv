"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for bargaining and potentially reach a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}

I'm going to try to split the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I have a few rounds left and John is still a possibility. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm continuing to try and split the difference, moving closer to Bob's offer but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure with only 4 rounds left, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $15,000. John is still an option, but I want to exhaust my options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly, hoping to find a price that Bob will accept. I'm still trying to get as close to my minimum as possible, but I'm also aware that I'm running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is getting closer to his own value of $12,000, which is much less than my minimum of $15,000.  It's clear that we're not going to be able to reach a deal that works for me.  Therefore, I'm going to sell to John for $15,000."
