"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $20000. This is a significant discount from its true worth. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $15000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer the product to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $16500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",16500.0,Bob,4,
