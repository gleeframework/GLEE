"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $18000? I'm very interested in purchasing the product if we can reach an agreement.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $18000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Would you be willing to pay $19000? This would allow me to make a fair profit and ensure a smooth transaction for both of us.",19000.0,Alice,3,
