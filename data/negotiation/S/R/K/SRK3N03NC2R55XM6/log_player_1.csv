{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $20,000 is higher than your minimum of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's not too high:** It's not so high that Bob would immediately reject it, but it leaves space for you to potentially negotiate higher. 

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $18000? I'm very interested in purchasing the product if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $18,000 is above your minimum, it's still worth trying to negotiate a higher price. Bob has shown interest and acknowledged the product's value, so there's potential to get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $18,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Would you be willing to pay $19,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit and ensure a smooth transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a high price:**  It keeps the price closer to your initial offer, suggesting you're not willing to give up too much.
* **Be reasonable:**  $19,000 is a compromise between your desired price and Bob's offer, showing you're open to negotiation.
* **Highlight mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes a fair profit for you and a smooth transaction for both parties. 

Let's see if this offer convinces Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're finding common ground. I'd like to propose a price of $17500 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $17,500 is lower than your ideal price, it's still above your minimum of $15,000. Accepting this offer secures a sale and allows you to move forward with the transaction. It's important to weigh the value of time and potential negotiation vs. the guaranteed $17,500."
