"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I place on it and is still a good deal for you considering John is willing to sell it for $800,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value John is willing to pay. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $875,000. I'm happy to offer you $860,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both place on this product.  I believe this price is reasonable, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",860000.0,Bob,4,
