# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value John is willing to pay. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $875,000 is closer to his budget, he can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He's still $75,000 above John's price, so there's room for further negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $870,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $870,000 is closer to his budget, it's still $70,000 more than what he could get from John. The negotiation seems to be getting stuck, and further rounds might not lead to a significantly better price.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John and secure a lower price, guaranteeing the purchase."
