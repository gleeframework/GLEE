"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the unique value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $875,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $875,000. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a reasonable price. While $825,000 is a significant amount, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  Let's see if we can push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $850,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, but I need to be honest, I'm starting to consider other options. Can we meet at $820,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now mentioning ""other options,"" indicating he's getting closer to his limit. However, we still have four rounds of negotiation, and  $820,000 is a significant difference from John's guaranteed offer. It's worth a calculated risk to push Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I value your interest in this product.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $835,000. This is a very competitive price and a testament to my desire to close this deal with you.  Let me know if this works for you."",
""product_price"": 835000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're entering the later stages of negotiation, and it's time to signal firmness while still offering a small concession.  By framing this as a ""final offer"" and highlighting the value, we aim to bring Bob closer to a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $835,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but I'm starting to get a bit skeptical about the value of the product at this price. I'd like to think that we can meet at $815,000, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer of $815,000 makes the most sense at this stage for several reasons:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is clearly signaling his limit, and pushing further risks losing the deal entirely.  
* **Time Value:**  We only have two rounds left, and there's no guarantee we'll get a better offer from Bob in that time.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting now allows us to move on and potentially explore other deals or investments. 

While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, the difference of $185,000 isn't significant enough to justify the risk of losing Bob entirely at this point."
