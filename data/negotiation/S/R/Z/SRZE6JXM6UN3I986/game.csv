"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept your price of $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm open to further negotiations, but I think this is a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $900,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $900,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm open to further negotiations, but I think this is a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
