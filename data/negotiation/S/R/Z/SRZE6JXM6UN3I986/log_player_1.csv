Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept your price of $800,000.

I'm open to further negotiations, but I think this is a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $900,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $900,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,050,000.
