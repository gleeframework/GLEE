{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Negotiation Space:** This creates a negotiation range of $700,000 ($1,500,000 - $800,000).
* **Targeting Higher:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation maximizes your potential profit. 

By offering the product at $1,200,000, you:

* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Bob might counter-offer, but you're still well above your minimum.
* **Present a compelling case:**  The offer is significantly less than Bob's valuation, making it attractive.
* **Maximize potential profit:**  You could potentially make $400,000 more than selling to John."
