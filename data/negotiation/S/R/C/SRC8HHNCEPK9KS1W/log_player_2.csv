While closer, $100 is still above my target price. I'll try to negotiate a bit further."

```

Alice is getting closer to my walk-away point ($90) and called this her final offer. While I might be able to push a little further, saving an extra $3-$4 isn't worth the risk of losing the deal entirely.  $97 is a reasonable price."
