"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $7500? I believe that would still allow us to reach a fair agreement.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going down to $7500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
