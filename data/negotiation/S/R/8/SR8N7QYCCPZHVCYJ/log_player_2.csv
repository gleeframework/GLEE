"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it for $11,500.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while still getting the product. 
* **Alice's offer:** $11,500 is too high for Bob, as he values the product at $12,000.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the product, but $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save money, but not lose the deal.  
* **Counteroffer Logic:**  Bob is offering a price that is close to Alice's perceived value of the product ($10,000) but still allows for some potential negotiation.  It's a fair starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:** $11,000 is still above Bob's perceived value of the product ($12,000). 
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. There is still room for compromise, and he shouldn't settle for a price that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Get the best price possible.
* **Counteroffer Logic:**  
    * Bob is increasing his offer, showing his willingness to negotiate.
    * $10,750 is a compromise that splits the difference between Bob's previous offer ($10,500) and Alice's current offer ($11,000).
    * This counteroffer still leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation.  While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, I can't go as low as $10,750.  My final offer is $10,900.  I believe this reflects the value of the product while still giving you a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save money but still get the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $10,900 is getting very close to Bob's perceived value of $12,000.
* **Strategic Considerations:** 
    *  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away.
    *  Buying from John for $12,000 is a guaranteed option, but it's more expensive. 
* **Decision:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice at this point. It's a fair price, and there's no guarantee that a better deal will be available in the remaining rounds. Bob is saving $1,100 compared to buying from John."
