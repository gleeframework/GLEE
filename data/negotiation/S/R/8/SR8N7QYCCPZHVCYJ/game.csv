"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the product, but $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation.  While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, I can't go as low as $10,750.  My final offer is $10,900.  I believe this reflects the value of the product while still giving you a fair deal.",10900.0,Alice,5,
