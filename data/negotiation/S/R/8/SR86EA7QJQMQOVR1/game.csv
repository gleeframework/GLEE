"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. Considering the product's value to me is $150, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, considering the product's value to me is $150, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $135. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
