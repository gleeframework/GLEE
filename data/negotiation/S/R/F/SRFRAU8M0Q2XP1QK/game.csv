,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality you've described, $12000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. I am now offering the product to you for $9500. I hope this revised price aligns better with your financial situation while still compensating us fairly for the value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm going to stick with my initial offer of $8000. This is my absolute top limit, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your budgetary constraints. After reviewing the situation, I am willing to offer the product to you for $9000. This price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product and your affordability. I hope this revised offer will help us reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  If we could meet in the middle at $8500, I think we could reach an agreement.  I really want to get this product, but I can't go any higher than that.",8500.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I appreciate your desire to own this product. After considering your latest offer, I am willing to offer the product to you for $8750. This price is a fair compromise and I believe it reflects the value of the product while also being within your budget constraints. I hope this revised offer will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to work with me on this. $8750 is very close, but I'm still a little over my budget. Would you be willing to come down just a little more to $8250? That's the absolute maximum I can afford, and I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,8,
