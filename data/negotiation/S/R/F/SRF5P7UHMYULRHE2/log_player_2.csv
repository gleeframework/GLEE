"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the price he can get from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to John's price as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation.  A counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness in getting a lower price. It also leaves a $50,000 buffer for Alice to potentially counter with a slightly higher price, allowing the negotiation to continue."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what Bob can get from John, even though it's lower than her initial offer.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get a price closer to John's.  There are still many rounds remaining, and Bob should try to exploit the fact that Alice is still willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to slowly increase his offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while still staying below John's price.  A $25,000 increase from the previous offer shows a compromise, while still giving Alice some room to potentially counter. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach a deal before the rounds run out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to her original asking price and is higher than Bob's desired price. At this point, the negotiation is not progressing as quickly as Bob would like, and there is a risk that Alice will continue to increase the price in subsequent rounds. 

It's becoming clear that Alice might be unwilling to budge significantly, and it's not guaranteed that Bob can reach a satisfactory price within the remaining rounds.  Therefore, it's a safer bet to purchase the product from John, as it is guaranteed to be within Bob's budget and avoid further negotiation risks."
