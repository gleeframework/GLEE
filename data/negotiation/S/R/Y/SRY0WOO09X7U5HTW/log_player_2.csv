Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure you'll see the value once you get it.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering its potential. This is my final offer.
