"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly unique and I believe it can be a game-changer for your business. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let's discuss further and see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree the product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider  $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure you'll see the value once you get it.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering its potential. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
