"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. While $8,500 is a good offer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the product.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming back with a revised price. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8800.0,Bob,4,
