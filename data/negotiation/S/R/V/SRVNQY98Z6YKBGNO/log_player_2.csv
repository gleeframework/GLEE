"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering $120. You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's closer to Alice's desired price of $100, but still within my budget of $150. This increases the chances of Alice accepting while still saving me money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my maximum price, but I can still try to negotiate a better price. If I reject this offer, I can counteroffer again.  It's worth trying to get closer to my target price before potentially settling with John at $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to come down from her initial price. I'm offering a price that's still slightly lower than her current offer, but it's closer to my target price and hopefully a compromise she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd still like to pay less, Alice has consistently increased her price with each rejection.  It's likely we're close to a final price. Accepting this offer means I get the product for $130, which is significantly less than what John would charge me.  It's a good balance between getting a reasonable price and avoiding further negotiations."
