Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $115 is still within Bob's range to potentially accept, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still above your minimum value of $120, leaving you room to potentially lower the price if necessary. 
* **It's a clear starting point:** This message establishes a firm price and sets the stage for a clear negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the condition of the product, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120.  I'll counteroffer Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110 to see if we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasonable Counter:** $110 is a compromise, a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Agreement:**  The message stresses finding an agreement, encouraging Bob to consider this offer.
* **Keeps Option Open:** It's still above my minimum, allowing flexibility for further negotiation if needed."
