"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as you value the product at $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down to a price closer to her $10,000 valuation. You have a better chance of saving more money by negotiating or using John's offer as leverage."
