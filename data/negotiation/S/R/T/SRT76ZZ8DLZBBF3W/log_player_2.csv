"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $100 is too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a starting point. It's a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards if needed while staying well below our $120 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate.  Let's see if we can get her closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 is a big drop. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

We're now offering Alice her value for the product. It's a strong offer, and it might be wise for her to accept. Even if she counters, we've established a good position for further negotiation."
