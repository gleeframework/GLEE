"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you can consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of your product, I am still unable to meet the price at $9,000. I would like to propose a final offer of $8,500. This is the highest amount I am willing to pay for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",8750.0,Alice,5,
