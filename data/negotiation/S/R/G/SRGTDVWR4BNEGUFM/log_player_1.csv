"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for negotiation room. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price gradually in subsequent rounds. I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, so I'm not willing to settle for less unless absolutely necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $700,000 is too low for me, especially considering I know the product is worth at least $800,000.  I'm going to try to get a better price by counter-offering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to come up a bit more in the next round. I have a feeling we're close to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000. This is getting close to my minimum, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to Bob. I'm hoping that with only a few rounds left, he'll realize that he needs to increase his offer if he wants to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation.  Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum, but I also know that I can sell to John for the same price.  Since we're already in round 6, there's a risk that further negotiation will drag things out and I might end up with a lower offer. 

Therefore, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. I can secure my minimum, and avoid the potential risks of further negotiation."
