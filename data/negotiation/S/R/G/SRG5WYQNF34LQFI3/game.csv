"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $11200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15000. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
