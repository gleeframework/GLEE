Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I can potentially get more by counteroffering.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000 unless I absolutely have to."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with him.  I'll sell to John for $10,000 to guarantee my minimum price."
