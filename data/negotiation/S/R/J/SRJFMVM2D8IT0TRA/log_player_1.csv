"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's initial interest and see if he's willing to play ball at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still below my desired starting point. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $1,100,000.  It's getting closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a bit lower than my previous offer but still above Bob's last offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to drop below my desired value just yet.  I'm hoping this will be a tempting offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is only slightly below my minimum value, it's important to remember that I have only 4 rounds left.  If I reject this offer, I may end up losing out on a deal with Bob, and I could potentially lose a significant amount of money by selling to John at $1,000,000.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000.  This is a compromise between Bob's offer and my minimum value. I'm hoping that this will be a tempting offer for Bob, as it is not too far from his last offer and would still be a significant profit for me. I only have 3 rounds left, so I need to be careful and not push too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly below my minimum value.  I only have two rounds left.  While I could try to counteroffer again, there is a high risk that Bob will reject it, leaving me with no deal and only one round left to sell to John.  Selling to John now guarantees me my minimum value, which is better than risking a lower price or potentially losing the deal altogether."
