"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product,  $18000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're open to that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's worth considering.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $12000. If you're not comfortable with that, I may need to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $14000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not comfortable going above $12000. It's my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
