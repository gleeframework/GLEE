"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, the $1,000,000 offer is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,750,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $1,100,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to consider $1,400,000, but that's my absolute final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
