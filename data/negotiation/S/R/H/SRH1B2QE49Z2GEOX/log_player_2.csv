"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's potential to save even more.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and pushes her to consider coming down in price.  A $50,000 reduction is a good starting point, but I'm prepared to go lower if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still above my desired price point. I'm willing to push further and see if I can get her lower. There's still some room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price I might regret later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to push for a lower price. I've offered a slightly lower amount than the previous round, but it's still within a reasonable range that I'm confident Alice might accept. I want to get closer to my ideal price without being too aggressive and risking losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a decent price considering my initial counteroffer. I've already made some progress and I'm not sure how much lower she's willing to go. At this point, accepting the offer is the most rational choice.  There's a good chance I can save a substantial amount compared to buying from John, and I'm confident this is a fair price for the product."
