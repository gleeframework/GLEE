Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product at my minimum acceptable price. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit. If Bob rejects, I'll still have the option of selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop that low. I will counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly, but still keep it above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell.  Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $12,000.  Since John is willing to pay that price, I'll go ahead and sell to him to ensure I get my desired profit."
