"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $10,500. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $11,200 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
