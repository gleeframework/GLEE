"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still unable to meet you at $11500 due to my budget constraints. I would like to propose an offer of $10500 if that might be feasible for you.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10500. I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm offering you the product for $11250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
