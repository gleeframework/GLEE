"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product is certainly valuable to me, $900,000 is still a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000 for the product. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I believe it holds for you, while also acknowledging your desire to pay a lower price. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll consider a price of $912,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I believe it holds for you, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
