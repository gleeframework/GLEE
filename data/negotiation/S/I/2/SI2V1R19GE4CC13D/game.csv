"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1300000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1150000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to meet you at $1250000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
