# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, it's still a significant amount.  You can likely negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a bit more. How about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $110 is within my budget. It's also a fair price for me and allows Alice to make some profit.  Accepting her offer saves time and avoids further negotiation."
