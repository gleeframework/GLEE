Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This makes it attractive to Bob, increasing the chances of a quick deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  If Bob counteroffers, you can still make a profit. 

By starting with a strong offer and being open to negotiation, you increase your chances of getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a bit more. How about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It shows you're willing to negotiate, but not drastically lower your price.
* **Lower than your initial offer:** It demonstrates flexibility and shows you're open to a deal.
* **Still within your profit margin:** This ensures you're getting a decent return on the product."
