"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $85, you have room to negotiate and potentially save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting by offering $75. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $85, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm aiming to find a price that is fair to both of us and allows me to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target price of $75. I'm not willing to settle yet, as I believe there's more room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 78}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $78. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal. I'm hoping that this compromise will be enough to convince Alice to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price again to $82. While this is still slightly above my ideal price of $78, it's a fair compromise.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal.  There are only 5 rounds left and it's getting closer to the point where it makes more sense to just buy from John."
