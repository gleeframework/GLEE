"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1500000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $1200000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, as it's the minimum value I'd be willing to accept. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1050000? This would still be a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $900000, so I'm thinking more along the lines of $975000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm excited about the possibility of making a deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $975000. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1050000, as it's the minimum value I'd be willing to accept. Would you be willing to meet me at $1025000? This would still be a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
