Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it's always best to try and secure the highest possible price. 
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, offering it slightly below John's price creates a strong incentive for Bob to buy.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested parties and framing it as a limited-time offer, I create a sense of urgency that might push Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
