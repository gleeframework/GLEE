"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",7500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $7,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to think about my costs and profit margins. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $7,000. How about we try $7,250? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the quality of the product.",7250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $7,250 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $7,125. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",7125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $7,200. It's getting close to my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet at $7,175? It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth considering.",7175.0,Alice,5,
