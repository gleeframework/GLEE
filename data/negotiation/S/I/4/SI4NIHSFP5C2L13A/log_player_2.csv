This product is way above your budget. It's best to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

This counteroffer is your maximum budget. You are willing to pay the full price from John, but you still want to see if Alice is willing to meet you at this price. It's a bold move, but it could lead to a quick deal if Alice is motivated to sell."

Alice is not willing to budge much, and we are already halfway through the rounds. It's time to cut our losses and move on to John's offer."
