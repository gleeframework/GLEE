"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value you're placing on the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $875,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair reflection of the value I see in this product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to find some common ground. However, $875,000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counter with a price of $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $920,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer a final price of $890,000. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, and I hope it's acceptable to you.  It would be a good compromise for both of us.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the wire, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one last attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $890,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'll meet you in the middle at $905,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",905000.0,Alice,7,
