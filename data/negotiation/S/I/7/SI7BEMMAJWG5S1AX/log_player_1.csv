"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing my bottom line.
* **Polite and Professional:** The tone is respectful and positive, aiming to establish a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential savings you'll still make compared to selling it to John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my target price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe there's room for him to come up.  I'll counter-offer in the next round to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting yours. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This allows me to make a fair return while still providing you with a substantial saving compared to your initial valuation."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims for a classic negotiation tactic: meeting in the middle. It shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to my initial ask.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that this price benefits both parties.  It reinforces the value Bob gets while subtly reminding him of the potential ""loss"" if he doesn't take this deal.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:** The language remains collaborative and solution-oriented, aiming to keep the negotiation moving smoothly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly engaged in the negotiation and moving closer to my range. While $1,075,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for him to increase his offer, especially with 6 rounds remaining. I'll counter-offer again, but I'll be cautious not to push too hard and risk losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a fair price. I'm open to closing this deal soon, so how about this: $1,090,000, and we have a deal. This shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement while ensuring a reasonable outcome for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Urgency:** I'm signaling that I'm eager to finalize the deal. This creates a subtle sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Small Concession:**  By coming down $10,000, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still holding firm above the $1,080,000 midpoint.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:**  I'm presenting this price as a balanced solution that benefits both sides, reinforcing a positive tone for closing the deal. 
* **Consideration:** While I have the option to push further, this offer is already a strong win. It's important to consider the risk of Bob walking away if I appear too inflexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,080,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob has clearly stated this is his best price. Pushing further risks losing the deal altogether.
* **Strong Profit:**  $1,080,000 is a significant profit margin. It's a strong outcome for me, even if it's slightly below my initial target.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids further uncertainty and the potential for negotiations to break down.  It also allows me to re-invest the funds sooner.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds left, there's a real risk I won't be able to secure a significantly better deal from Bob."
