"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000, so I'm offering $1,150,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
