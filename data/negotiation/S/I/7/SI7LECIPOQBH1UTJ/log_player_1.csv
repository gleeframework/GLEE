{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I make a decent profit. It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. It also positions me closer to my ideal price while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000, so I'm offering $1,150,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's not ideal to lose out on the potential to make more money, but it's better than settling for a low price."
