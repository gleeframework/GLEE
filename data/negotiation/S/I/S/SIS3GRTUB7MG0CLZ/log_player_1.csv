# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $90, and while I could try to push for a bit more, there's a real risk he won't budge. Accepting $90 now is better than potentially getting stuck with a lower offer later or missing out on a sale altogether."
