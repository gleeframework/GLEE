"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This price reflects the significant value of the product and still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.",950000.0,Bob,4,
