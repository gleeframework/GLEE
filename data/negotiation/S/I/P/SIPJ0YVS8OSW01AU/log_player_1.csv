I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $100 is my minimum, I believe I can get more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me counter with $105. This feels like a fair compromise between your needs and mine. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $105 is still a good deal for me, and it avoids the risk of further negotiations or having to sell to John for a lower price."
