"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's still a fair price for you and allows me to get close to my desired value.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly closer to your desired value than what John is offering.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to stay closer to $1,100,000 to make this work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 for the product. This is still a great price for you, and it keeps us both happy. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,075,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and allows both of us to achieve a good outcome. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000 for the product, which is closer to your offer but still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to close this deal, as we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
