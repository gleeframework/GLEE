"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and highlights the value proposition for Bob, aiming to make him more receptive to the offer. 
* **Strategic Thinking:** This initial offer sets a high starting point and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000.  This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap and get closer to my desired price.

**Strategic Thinking:** 
By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to securing a fair price for the product. This also keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially extract a higher price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting the significant value this product offers. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while maintaining my commitment to a fair deal.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer, emphasize the value of the product, and express a willingness to negotiate. This creates a positive tone and encourages further dialogue.

**Strategic Thinking:** 

By making a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation moving forward. This price point is more appealing to Bob than my previous offer, but it still allows me to secure a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick to my previous offer of $1,200,000. I understand this may not be your ideal price, but it's the highest I'm willing to go.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm still hoping to get a better price, and I want to see if I can get Bob to budge. 

**Strategic Thinking:** 

* **Time is on my side:**  I have more rounds remaining, and I haven't yet reached the point where I need to accept an offer below my minimum.
* **I'm prepared to walk away:** If Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price, I'm prepared to sell to John.  

I'm going to make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to find a price that's more acceptable to both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm offering $1,400,000 as my final counteroffer.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** I'm lowering my price again, but this time I'm clearly stating this is my final counteroffer. I want Bob to understand that I'm serious about this price and I'm not going to go lower.
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating my understanding of Bob's position, highlighting the value of the product, and emphasizing that this is a good deal for both of us.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired goal. I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I want to see if I can push Bob a little further and potentially secure a price closer to $1,400,000.  

**Strategic Thinking:**

* **Time is a factor:**  With fewer rounds remaining, I need to decide whether to accept Bob's offer or risk selling to John.
* **Weighing Options:** I'm considering the possibility of selling to John, as this would secure my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm still hopeful that I can get a slightly better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'll also seriously consider selling to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $1,300,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,350,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob.  I'm proposing a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:**  I'm highlighting the fact that I'm trying to be reasonable and that this is my final offer. I'm also reminding Bob that if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider selling to John.

**Strategic Thinking:**

* **Time is Running Out:** This is the 7th round, and I only have three left. I need to make a decision soon.
* **Balancing Risks:**  I'm taking a calculated risk by offering a slightly lower price, but I'm also putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Prepared for Either Outcome:**  I'm prepared to either accept Bob's offer if he comes up slightly, or sell to John if we can't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $1,350,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to stick to my previous offer of $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:** Bob has remained steadfast at $1,300,000. While I'm not happy with the outcome,  it's clear that we are not going to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Time is running out:** This is Round 8, and I only have two more rounds left. I don't want to risk waiting any longer and potentially ending up with an even lower price.

**Strategic Thinking:** 

* **Protecting My Interests:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, which is significantly better than accepting Bob's final offer.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While I would have preferred to close the deal with Bob at a higher price,  selling to John minimizes my potential losses in this negotiation."
