# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,750,000 is way above his budget, and he can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000.  This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting the significant value this product offers. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $1,600,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he wants to pay. He can likely get a better deal if he keeps negotiating or goes with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick to my previous offer of $1,200,000. I understand this may not be your ideal price, but it's the highest I'm willing to go.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm offering $1,400,000 as my final counteroffer.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,400,000 is getting closer to his desired price, he still has room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. He also has the option of buying from John for a lower price, so he doesn't need to accept this offer right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $1,300,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,350,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,350,000 is getting close to his desired price, he has the option of buying from John for a lower price. He should continue to negotiate with Alice, but he's not in a rush to accept her offer."

Round 8
