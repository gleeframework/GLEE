"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal.  While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's room for negotiation to potentially get closer to his $8,000 value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,500 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $8,750? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum price of $10,000 and closer to his desired price of $8,000.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,250 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation could potentially yield a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it in this case."
