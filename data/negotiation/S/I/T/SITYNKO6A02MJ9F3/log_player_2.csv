"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can potentially get it for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be happy to pay $12,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still higher than Bob's maximum price. This is a strategic move. He's showing Alice he's serious about buying the product, but also setting a firm lower limit. This approach gives Bob room to negotiate further in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a significant discount from my original price, and it still allows me to make a decent profit. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $12,000.  While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's comfort zone. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to make another counteroffer.  He's likely hoping Alice will come down further in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to chip away at the price.  He's raised his offer slightly from his previous counteroffer, showing flexibility, but he's still staying below his maximum price and leaving room for further negotiation. This strategy keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price without completely shutting down the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need to be closer to my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $13250.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum of $12,000.  Bob is willing to push for a better deal, hoping that Alice will eventually come down to a price he's comfortable with. He still has five rounds left, and he wants to maximize his savings.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but I'm still looking to spend closer to $12,500. Let's split the difference and go with $12,750. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a counteroffer that's closer to his maximum price but still leaves some room for negotiation. He's showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product but also pushing for a better deal. He's hoping that Alice will accept this offer or come back with a counteroffer that's closer to his target."
