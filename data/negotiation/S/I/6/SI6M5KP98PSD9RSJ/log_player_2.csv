"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its quality and features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's better to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that Alice's initial price is unrealistic for you.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone helps keep the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of reaching a deal.
* **Clear Target:** Offering $100 establishes a clear starting point and allows Alice to gauge your price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $100 is quite below its value. Could you consider $160? I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down a bit, $160 is still significantly above your $120 limit and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to counter suggests there's flexibility in the price. There's a chance to meet closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the product's value, Alice, but $160 is still pushing my budget. Would you be open to meeting in the middle at $130? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Offering $130 shows a willingness to move closer to Alice's price while staying within a reasonable range of your budget. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""meeting in the middle"" frames your counteroffer as a fair compromise and might make it more appealing to Alice.
* **Alternative:** Keeping John's offer in mind means you have a backup plan if Alice isn't willing to negotiate further."
