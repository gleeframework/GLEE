``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $10,000.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm not happy with his lowball price, I'm still willing to negotiate further.  I believe I can get a better price than $9,000, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $10,500. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is higher than John's offer of $10,000. I'm accepting his offer, as it's closer to my desired price and saves me the time and effort of further negotiations."
