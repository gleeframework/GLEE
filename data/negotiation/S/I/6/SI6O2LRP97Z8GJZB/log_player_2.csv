"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's offer of $140 is still more than your maximum budget of $120. You can do better by rejecting her offer and buying from John for $120."
