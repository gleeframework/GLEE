Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $100 is higher than $80, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $100 is below your minimum of $120, but you can always fall back on John if needed.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It's easy for Bob to understand and respond to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $80. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm open to negotiating further if that doesn't work for you."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  If we can meet in the middle, I'm ready to buy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $120,  $90 is a good compromise, as it is above Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum. This offer gives me a decent profit while still allowing me to make a deal with Bob."
