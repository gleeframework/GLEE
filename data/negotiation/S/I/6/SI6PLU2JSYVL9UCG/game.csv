,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm open to negotiating further if that doesn't work for you.",92.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  If we can meet in the middle, I'm ready to buy.",90.0,Bob,4,
