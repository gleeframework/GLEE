"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm interested,  $13,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. Would you consider $10,000? It's a fair price, reflecting the value of the product and my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
