"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $72. Since the product is worth $80 to him, I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it.

Since $72 is lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal. I'll make a new counteroffer that's higher than $72 but still lower than $80.

Let's say I'll offer it to him for $76.
