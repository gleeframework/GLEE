"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $900,000. I'm offering it to you for $887,500. This is a fair compromise that I hope you'll consider.",887500.0,Alice,5,
