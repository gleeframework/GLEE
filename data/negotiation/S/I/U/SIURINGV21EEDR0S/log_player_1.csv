"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum asking price. I know the product is worth more to me than Bob, but I'm hoping he might be willing to pay close to my value to avoid going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum value.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $11,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's value.  I'm hoping that Bob might be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems to be stuck at $10,000.  I've already lowered my price once, and it's unlikely he'll budge. To avoid potentially going through more rounds of haggling and potentially ending up with nothing, I'm going to sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
