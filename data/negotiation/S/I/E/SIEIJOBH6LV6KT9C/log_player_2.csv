"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still significantly higher than her value for the product.  Since you have a fallback option (buying from John for $1,200,000), you can afford to be a bit more aggressive and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000.  Given the value to me is $1,200,000, I think this offer is fair and leaves us both with a profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. Considering the product's value to me is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves us both with a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  It's still a bit higher than what you initially wanted, but it's significantly lower than her value of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer allows you to save $350,000 compared to buying from John."
