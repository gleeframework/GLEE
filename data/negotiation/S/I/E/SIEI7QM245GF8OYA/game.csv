"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price. How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I think $7,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,5,,
