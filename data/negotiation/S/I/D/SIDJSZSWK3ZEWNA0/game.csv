"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you could be much higher. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer of $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. While I'm interested in the product, I'm only willing to pay $800000.  This is the maximum I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1200000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're still trying to find a price that works for you. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my original offer. I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
