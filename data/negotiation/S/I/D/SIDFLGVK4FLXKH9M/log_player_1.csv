{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I believe this is a fair price that allows for a good profit for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the potential for mutual gain, suggesting a ""fair"" price that benefits both of us. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a good price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and respond accordingly. 
* If the negotiations stall or become unproductive, I'll move on to John to secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I can try to meet him somewhere in the middle.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** While selling to John guarantees my minimum value, I want to explore getting closer to my desired price with Bob first.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my target, aiming to find a compromise. 
* If negotiations with Bob become too difficult, I'll sell the product to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price. However, $600,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards a middle ground:** I'm counter-offering at $850,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $600,000. This shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, implying that my offer is still fair considering its worth.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $700,000 is closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation has stalled:**  We've gone back and forth several times, and Bob's offers are not getting close to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is a safe alternative:**  I'm not confident that I can get a significantly better offer from Bob, and selling to John guarantees me my minimum value.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob again, but with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. If he rejects, I will sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $700,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000 as a final offer.

**Reasoning:**
