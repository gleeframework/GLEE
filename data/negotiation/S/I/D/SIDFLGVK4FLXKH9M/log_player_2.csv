"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I believe this is a fair price that allows for a good profit for both of us.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price. However, $600,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $700,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000 as a final offer. This is a significant discount from my initial price, but it's the lowest I can go. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $900,000.  Since you can get the product for $800,000 from John, it makes more financial sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
