Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so that's the absolute maximum he'd pay.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob saves $1,000 compared to his perceived value.
    * You earn a $2,000 profit above your minimum acceptable price.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
