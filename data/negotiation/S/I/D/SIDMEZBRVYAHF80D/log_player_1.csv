Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I am comfortable offering $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to our guaranteed sale price with John, we still have room to negotiate.  Bob clearly sees significant value in the product, exceeding his initial offer by $100,000. We'll continue to counter in hopes of securing a price closer to $1,100,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence. I am now willing to consider $1,075,000 as a final offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we are now at $1,075,000.  While we could push for more, we are only $25,000 away from John's offer.  Continuing the negotiation has diminishing returns and risks Bob settling for John's price anyway. Accepting this offer secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of a stalemate."
