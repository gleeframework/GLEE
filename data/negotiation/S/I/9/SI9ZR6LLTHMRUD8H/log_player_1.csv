Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of $100 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still giving Bob a potential good deal."
