(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $150 to you, $120 is a decent price, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer offers a price that is still attractive to Alice, as it's above her own valuation of the product ($100). It also leaves room for further negotiation if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has raised her price, but it's still within your acceptable range. However, since you are aiming for the best possible price, rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is clearly not willing to go down to your initial $105 offer.  This counteroffer is a compromise, increasing your offer slightly but still leaving some room for negotiation. It shows you are serious about buying the product but are also trying to find a price that works for both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is getting closer to your acceptable range, you are still aiming to save as much as possible. There are only 5 rounds remaining, and you can always buy from John for $150, so rejecting the offer gives you more negotiation room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has been stubborn, but you are still committed to getting the best deal. This counteroffer is another compromise, offering a price slightly higher than your previous offer. The remaining rounds are dwindling, so it's important to find a compromise that Alice might accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still unwilling to budge.  While $135 is getting closer to your upper limit, there are still 3 rounds left.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to try and negotiate a lower price before you have to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Explanation:**

The negotiation is reaching a critical point. You've tried to negotiate a lower price, but Alice has been firm. This counteroffer is a final attempt to meet in the middle. It's slightly higher than your previous offer but still a decent price for you. If Alice rejects this, you might have to consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has raised her price again, and there is only one round left.  It is highly unlikely that Alice will agree to a price lower than $140 at this point.  Buying from John for $150 is a better option than accepting Alice's offer, as you only lose $5 compared to your ideal price. You have already negotiated for a while, and there is no guarantee that Alice will accept your counteroffer."
