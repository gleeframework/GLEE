,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price, given the product's value to me.  Let's find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair profit for me. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable profit for you. Let's make a deal.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Let's close this deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  It's also the price that John is offering, so I'm ready to close the deal now.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
