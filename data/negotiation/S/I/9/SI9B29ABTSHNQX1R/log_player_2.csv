{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price, given the product's value to me.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair profit for me. Let's meet in the middle.

Bob should reject the offer. While it's closer to his target price, he can still try to get a better deal.  He's not desperate yet and could still potentially get the product for even less from Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable profit for you. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
