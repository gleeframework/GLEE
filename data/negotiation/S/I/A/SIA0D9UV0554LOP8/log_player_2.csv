"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! It's something I believe will be extremely valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  It's likely Alice would accept a counteroffer closer to her value of $800,000.  By rejecting, Bob can potentially save a significant amount of money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price point, but it's getting closer. There's still room for further negotiation to try and push the price down even more.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue haggling and potentially save even more money."
