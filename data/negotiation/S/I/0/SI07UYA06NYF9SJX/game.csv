"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $125, and that's as low as I can go.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, I'm still finding it a bit expensive.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $100?",100.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet, Bob. I can do $115, and that's the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
