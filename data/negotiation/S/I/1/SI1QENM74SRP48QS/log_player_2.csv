"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product for sale. It's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still more than Alice values the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice will lower the price further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, but $12,500 is still above her own valuation of the product and is closer to my maximum price. I'm willing to try a counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach a more agreeable price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Let's try $11,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already compromised by meeting you halfway from $12,000 to $12,500, and now you're asking me to go down to $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate but has a firm bottom line at $13,000. This is still a good deal for me as it's lower than John's price and closer to Alice's valuation. It's likely further negotiation will only lead to more back and forth without a significant price reduction. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with and avoids the risk of further negotiation breaking down."
