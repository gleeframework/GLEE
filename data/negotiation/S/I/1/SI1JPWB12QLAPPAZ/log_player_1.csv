"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $115, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting, hoping to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Room for Counteroffers:**  Leaving some space between my offer and Bob's perceived value allows for potential counteroffers and a more dynamic negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $120. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I can reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and demonstrates that I'm not desperate for a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Friendly and encouraging tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and conversational tone to keep Bob engaged.
* **Focus on a win-win:** Highlighting ""splitting the difference"" suggests a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Still above my minimum:** $105 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation space:** There's still room to negotiate upwards, and rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try for a better price.
* **Keeping options open:**  While $120 from John is appealing, there's a chance I can get closer to that with Bob. I haven't reached my maximum number of rounds yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I can't go all the way to $95, but how about we meet at $100? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good value for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but flexible:** I'm not dropping to Bob's price but am offering a slight concession to show willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm emphasizing that $100 is a good value for him, making it more appealing than simply rejecting his offer.
* **Staying above minimum:** $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
