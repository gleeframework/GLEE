Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000. Accepting this offer saves you $450,000 compared to John's price.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield much better results and could risk losing the deal."
