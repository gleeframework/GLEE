Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, but that doesn't mean it's his absolute limit. He might be willing to pay a premium to secure it.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, but even if he gets a discount, you're still likely to make a significant profit over your guaranteed price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, given the potential rewards, it's strategically sound to start high."
