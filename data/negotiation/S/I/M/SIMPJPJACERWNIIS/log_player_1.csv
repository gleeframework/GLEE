"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a strong offer that favors you. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""potential"" and ""benefits"" helps justify the high asking price without revealing Bob's potential maximum.
* **Leaving Room:** By starting at $1,300,000, there's a significant buffer for potential counteroffers, increasing the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price above your minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have the option to walk away and sell to John for $800,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential savings it offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant profit, it's still substantially lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer signals that you're aiming for a higher price while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a respectable offer, it doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product and the significant returns you'll see. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer suggests a compromise by splitting the difference between your previous offer ($1,300,000) and Bob's offer ($1,000,000). This classic negotiation tactic can signal fairness and encourage a deal.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message reinforces the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits and justifying a higher price point.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Aiming for $1,200,000 keeps the price significantly above your minimum ($800,000) while still offering a substantial discount from your initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,200,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This offer represents a significant savings for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,100,000 represents a $300,000 profit, which is substantial. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While there might be a slight margin for pushing further, Bob's increments are getting smaller. The risk of him walking away increases with each rejection. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
