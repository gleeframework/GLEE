"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,300,000 is still too high for Bob, as he is aiming to spend no more than $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price, potentially saving him money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential savings it offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a respectable offer, it doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product and the significant returns you'll see. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price. There are still several rounds left, so there's time to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,200,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This offer represents a significant savings for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
