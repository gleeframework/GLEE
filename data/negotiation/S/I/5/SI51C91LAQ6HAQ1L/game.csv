"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm not able to accept that price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  That represents a fair compromise for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $975,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,012,500?  This would be a win-win scenario for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we both want to find a solution that works. To be honest, $1,000,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
