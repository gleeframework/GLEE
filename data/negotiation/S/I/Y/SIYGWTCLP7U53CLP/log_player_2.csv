Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $8,500? This is a good deal for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
