Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price above my minimum ($10,000) but still below what I know the product is worth to Bob ($15,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal, while still ensuring I get a profitable sale.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have John as an alternative buyer at $10,000, I can be confident in rejecting any counteroffers that don't reach my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $11,000 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price range. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This strategy shows good faith and a willingness to compromise.  It's a reasonable halfway point between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  This price still allows me to earn significantly more than selling to John,  while also potentially enticing Bob to accept.
* **Increased Incentive:**  The counteroffer is still slightly above Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept to avoid further negotiation."
