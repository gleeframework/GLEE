"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate down if Bob isn't willing to pay that much. I want to see how much value Bob places on the product before I start discounting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price point, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial asking price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,800. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still keeping the price relatively high. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that Bob finds agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,600. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good deal. I've already rejected two of Bob's offers and it's getting late in the negotiation.  I'm at risk of losing out on a good price and ending up selling to John for less.  It's time to close the deal."
