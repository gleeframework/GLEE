"Alice,  thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'd be happy to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This price reflects a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. Would you consider $1,200,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This offer reflects a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
