Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob understands the true value to him. It's significantly less than your guaranteed price and a substantial profit over his perceived value. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly without revealing you already have a buyer lined up. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a real-world scenario,  you might adjust your approach based on Bob's responses and further negotiation."
