"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations considering the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" without being overly specific.  This helps justify the high initial price.
* **Open for Negotiation:**  The tone is positive and inviting, making it clear that you're open to discussion and finding a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits it offers. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. Selling to John would be a last resort if negotiations with Bob fail to reach an acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,800,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial proposal. How about we meet halfway and settle on $2,025,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of this product."",
""product_price"": 2025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:**  You're making a significant concession by dropping $225,000, demonstrating flexibility. However, you're still anchoring the negotiation around your initial price by justifying it with the product's ""true worth.""
* **Meeting Halfway:** Suggesting a middle ground often feels like a fair compromise to both parties. It shows you're actively seeking a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the market value and the potential benefits, I'm willing to offer $1,700,000. I think this is a fair price and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating he's willing to negotiate. However, $1,700,000 is still significantly below your $1,500,000 minimum.  You need to signal that you're willing to walk away if a fair price isn't reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, I need to be upfront about the value of what I'm offering.  $1,900,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go.  This reflects the absolute minimum I consider fair for this product. I believe it's a strong offer considering the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This message establishes a firm bottom line while still attempting to reach an agreement with Bob. By stating this is your absolute lowest, you're signaling the seriousness of your position.
* **Focus on Value:** The message reiterates the product's value to justify the price without getting bogged down in back-and-forth over smaller increments.
* **Limited Time:** By Round 5, introducing a slight sense of urgency can be beneficial. While not explicitly stated, implying that you have other options (John) could encourage Bob to move closer to your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the market value and the potential benefits, I'm willing to offer $1,750,000. I think this is a fair price and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  His incremental increases suggest he is unlikely to meet your valuation in the remaining rounds.  At this point, continuing negotiations with Bob presents a significant risk of losing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. 

It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed offer."
