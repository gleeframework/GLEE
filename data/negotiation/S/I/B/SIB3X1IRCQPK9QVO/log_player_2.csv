"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit far from being willing to meet you at $550,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $600,000. This is a compromise that I think is more reasonable, given the product's worth to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get the price even lower, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $610,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $610,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $610,000

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice seems pretty firm on her price. Accepting at $610,000 secures a decent discount from both her original offer and John's price."
