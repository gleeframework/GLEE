"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $105 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to that.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $100? This is the absolute lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!",100.0,Alice,5,
