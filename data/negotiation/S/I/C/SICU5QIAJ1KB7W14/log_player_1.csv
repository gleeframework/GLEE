{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're already making a profit above your $8,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** $10,000 is below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not starting too low, which could make Bob think he can get a much better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal right away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's above your minimum, it's significantly lower than the $10,000 you initially offered. 
* **There's room for counter-offer:** Bob is clearly interested in the product, and you can likely secure a price closer to your desired range with a counter-offer.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** If you can't get a better deal with Bob, you still have the option of selling to John. 

**Next Move:** 

You'll send a counteroffer to Bob. Aim for a price that's closer to your initial offer and leaves some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This still allows me to make a fair profit, and it's a significant step towards your offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground here!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is exactly halfway between your previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500).
* **Shows willingness to negotiate:**  This shows Bob that you're serious about making a deal, but you're not willing to give up too much.
* **Leaves room for a final deal:** There's still room for a bit more negotiation, but it's a strong position to be in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good profit:** $9,000 is a good profit for you, exceeding your minimum of $8,000.
* **Closing the deal:**  Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.
* **Limited upside:** While you could try for a higher price, Bob might reject, and you're unlikely to get much more than $9,000.

It's a good strategy to accept Bob's offer and secure a deal that is both profitable and avoids further risk."
