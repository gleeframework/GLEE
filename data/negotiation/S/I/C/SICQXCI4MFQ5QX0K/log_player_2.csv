Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to move forward with the sale. What do you think?

# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.

This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to move forward with the sale.
