Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $120 is still too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $120 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $125. How about we meet in the middle at $122.50? That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, I've already been through a few rounds and Bob seems firm on $122.50.  This is a good deal for me considering my minimum is $100 and John is willing to pay that.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
