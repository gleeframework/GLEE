"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $120 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $125. How about we meet in the middle at $122.50? That's the best I can do for now.",122.5,Bob,4,
