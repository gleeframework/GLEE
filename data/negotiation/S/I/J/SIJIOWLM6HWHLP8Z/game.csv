"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $900000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit off from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $950000, which I believe reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find common ground here and finalize the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
