Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (You have a guaranteed buyer)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Your Goal:** Maximize profit, ideally getting a price closer to $1,500,000 from Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high with your initial offer, leaving room for negotiation while still staying above your minimum. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and the high demand I've received, I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for a product of this caliber.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1700000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,700,000 is significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives you negotiating room.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and demand, justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in a discussion.

**Important Note:**  While you have a fallback option with John, be prepared for Bob to decline your initial offer. Negotiation often involves multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers."
