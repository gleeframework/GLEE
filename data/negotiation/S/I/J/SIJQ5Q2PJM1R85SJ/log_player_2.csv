{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice:**  You'd pay $14,000, which is still within your budget of $15,000.
* **Buying from John:** You'd pay $15,000, which is the maximum you're willing to spend.

Since accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John, it's the better choice to maximize your savings."
