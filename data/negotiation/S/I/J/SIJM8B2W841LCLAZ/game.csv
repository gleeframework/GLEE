"Hi Alice, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $75.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $80, which is the price John is offering. If you're not willing to come down to that, I'll have to go with John.",80.0,Bob,4,
