Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still earning significantly more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is likely to counteroffer, and you can then adjust your price based on his response.
* **It shows you're serious about a deal:** By offering a price close to the middle ground, you demonstrate that you're willing to negotiate but also value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and your desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Negotiate further:** You can counteroffer with a price closer to your desired $950,000.
* **Gauge Bob's seriousness:** If he's willing to offer more after rejecting your initial offer, it suggests he's genuinely interested in the product.
* **Maintain your position:** Accepting his offer too quickly might make you appear desperate and could result in a lower price in future negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still below my desired price. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $900,000, considering the value this product offers you.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise that shows you're willing to negotiate while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize value:** The message highlights the benefits the product provides to Bob, encouraging him to consider a higher price.
* **Focus on finding a solution:**  The message emphasizes a shared benefit, suggesting a collaborative approach to reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While this offer isn't ideal, it's a good starting point for further negotiation. You could potentially counteroffer with a slightly higher price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away completely. It's better to secure a deal at this price and potentially negotiate further later. 

**Overall:** The potential benefits of accepting Bob's offer outweigh the risks of rejecting it and possibly losing the deal entirely."
