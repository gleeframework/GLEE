"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a better price than $120 from John, you can potentially get a better deal from Alice.  You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $80. There is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $90, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $100 and my maximum of $120. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but am also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $95, which is only $5 more than my counteroffer of $90.  It's still a better deal than buying from John for $120. At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly lower price, so accepting is the most logical choice."
