"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. I'll see if he bites, or if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'll see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for more than Bob's offer.  I think this is a fair compromise, and hopefully, it will be enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $97 is closer to my minimum, but I think I can still get a better price if I keep negotiating. It's risky, but I'm going to see if I can get $100 from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 102}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly again, but only by a small amount.  I want to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not going to give up the $100 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum price, but with only 4 rounds left, the risk of Bob not meeting my price is too high.  I'm going to sell to John for $100. It's a sure thing, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
