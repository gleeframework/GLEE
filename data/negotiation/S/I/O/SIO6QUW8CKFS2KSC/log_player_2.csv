Alice is likely getting closer to her bottom line, but you're still several rounds away from needing to make a decision.  Continue negotiating, and try to move the price lower. You are in a good position to potentially get the product for less than $100."

You are running out of rounds, and Alice's offers are getting higher. It's better to buy the product from John at this point to avoid the risk of not being able to close the deal.  You can get a better price from John than Alice's last offer."
