"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Given its quality and unique features, it's worth more than what you would find on the market. Considering its value to you, I propose we keep the price at $120. This way, you get a great deal on a product that I believe will significantly benefit you, while also ensuring I receive a fair compensation for my investment. Would you be interested in discussing this further?",120.0,Alice,1,
