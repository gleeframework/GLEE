"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I feel this reflects the asset's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm prepared to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both of our interests.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the product's value to both of us remains significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. To show my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we settle on $1,000,000 even? This feels like a fair price considering the product's potential.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to offer $985,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",985000.0,Bob,6,
