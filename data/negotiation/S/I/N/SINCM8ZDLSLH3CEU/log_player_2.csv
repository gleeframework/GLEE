"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum, you can potentially save more by counteroffering. You know the product is worth more to Alice than to you, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay from John. While you could continue to negotiate with Alice, there's no guarantee that she'll come down to your desired price.  You've already saved $25,000 by going with John, so it's the most logical choice."
