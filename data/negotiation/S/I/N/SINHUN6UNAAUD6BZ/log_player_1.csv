"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is above Bob's perceived value but not drastically so. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interests:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer more enticing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not setting a hardline stance, allowing for potential counteroffers and flexibility in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $9,000 is a significant increase, it's still far below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is willing to pay more than his initial assessment, showing potential for further negotiation.
* **Staying with Bob for now:** I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's potential to gain a higher price by continuing with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my desired price point, hopefully leading to a mutually acceptable agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still unable to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would give you a good deal and allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.

```

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close. I understand you're still hesitant, but I need to be at least at $9,900 to make this work for me.
