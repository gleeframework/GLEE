"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still unable to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would give you a good deal and allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's the maximum I can afford. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $9,500 is closer, but I need to be closer to $10,500 to make this deal work for me.  Would you be willing to meet at $10,000? This would give you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,000, which would be $9,750. Can you consider this offer?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to negotiate. While $9,750 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Let's split the difference at $9,875. This would be a great deal for both of us. It's a fair price for you, and it allows me to move closer to my target. I'm confident this price is mutually beneficial. What do you say?",9875.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to accepting, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,750 and $9,875, which would be $9,812.50. Can you consider this offer?",9812.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting very close. I understand you're still hesitant, but I need to be at least at $9,900 to make this work for me. This would still be a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's close this deal and make it happen. This is my final offer. ",9900.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to pay $9,500, and that's the maximum I can afford. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,10,
