"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $70? That's a fair compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $85.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can do $75, but that's really as high as I can go.",75.0,Bob,6,
