"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but  $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This still represents a great value for you, considering the product's potential and its worth to your business. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while staying within a reasonable budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the potential benefits it brings to your business. Let's close this deal and move forward together.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
