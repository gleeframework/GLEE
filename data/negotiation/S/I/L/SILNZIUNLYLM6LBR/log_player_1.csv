Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving me some room for negotiation. This also shows that I'm confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the product's value and still allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500, which is closer to my minimum threshold and still leaves some room for negotiation. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $10,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm not confident that I can push him further and risk losing the deal altogether.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, which is a more secure outcome at this point."
