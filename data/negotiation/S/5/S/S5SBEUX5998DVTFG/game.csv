"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob! Thank you for your offer of $85. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling the product for $105. It's a fair price considering its unique features and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $105 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95?  ",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob! Thank you for your offer of $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to sell the product for $102. It's still a great deal considering its value and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",102.0,Alice,5,
