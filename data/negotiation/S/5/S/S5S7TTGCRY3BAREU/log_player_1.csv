I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This sets a strong initial benchmark and allows room for negotiation. It's important to remember that I have a floor price of $800,000, so I'm willing to negotiate down from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my floor price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my floor price. This shows flexibility while maintaining a price point that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is too low for me.  I'm going to sell to John for $800,000 to ensure I get at least my floor price.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is the most secure option at this point in the negotiation."
