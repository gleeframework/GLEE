"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is less than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price.  Starting with a counteroffer of $12,500 is a good strategy. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still acknowledges that the product has value. This gives Alice room to negotiate while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. Although it's lower than her initial offer, Bob is determined to save as much as possible.  He's likely to keep rejecting offers until he reaches a price closer to his maximum budget, or until he's comfortable buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. He's moved closer to Alice's offer, but still wants to get a better price. Offering $13,000 shows that he's willing to compromise but is still holding firm on his budget. This keeps the negotiation moving and gives Alice another opportunity to consider a lower price."
