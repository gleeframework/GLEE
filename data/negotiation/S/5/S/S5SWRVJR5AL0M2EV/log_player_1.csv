I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a fair price considering it's worth $12,000 to him and $15,000 to me. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm also willing to sell to John for $15,000 if we can't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell the product for less than $14,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm willing to lower my price to $14,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  This is still a fair price considering what it's worth to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $14,000.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000. It's a better deal for me, and it avoids further negotiation."
