"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $800000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $750000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $750000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price.  I'm willing to offer $725000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",725000.0,Bob,4,
