Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, considering its value and my budget. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

Bob is getting very close to my baseline, and while I could push for more, accepting his offer of $825,000 is a sure thing and a good profit. It's better to take this deal now than risk him lowering his offer or walking away in later rounds."
