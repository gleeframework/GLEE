Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,750. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we're now at $16,750. The difference between this offer and my desired price is getting smaller, and continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Accepting this offer ensures a sale at a price significantly above my minimum, and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
