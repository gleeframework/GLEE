# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. What do you think?

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price of $8,000.  While it's a better deal than her first offer, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject her offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above my target price of $8,000.  While she's willing to meet me halfway, her offer is still too high.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $8,000, as it's within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
