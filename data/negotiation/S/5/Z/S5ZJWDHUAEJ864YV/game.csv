"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to settle for $9,750?  That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",9750.0,Bob,4,
