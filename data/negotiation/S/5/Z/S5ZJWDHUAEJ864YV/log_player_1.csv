{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $12,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, hopefully motivating him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to settle for $9,750?  That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$9,750 is very close to my desired price point and it seems like Bob is ready to close the deal. It's more beneficial to accept his offer than to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether."
