"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $12,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $15,000, I want to start significantly lower to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** My offer of $9,000 is still a substantial profit margin for Alice (considering her value is $8,000) and keeps me comfortably below my maximum budget.
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** My message aims to be respectful while clearly stating my position and inviting further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved closer to my price, $10,500 is still a significant markup from her $8,000 value. There's room to negotiate further. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I have the option to buy from John for $15,000. This provides leverage as I'm not desperate to accept Alice's offer. 
* **Testing Alice's Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, I want to see how flexible Alice is willing to be and if she's willing to come closer to my desired price range."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to settle for $9,750?  That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase, Showing Willingness:** By increasing my offer slightly to $9,750, I demonstrate to Alice that I am willing to move towards a compromise.
* **Setting a Firm Limit:**  While I increased my offer, my message makes it clear that $9,750 is my limit and I am ready to walk away if Alice doesn't accept.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I want to convey that I'm eager to make a deal, but only at a price that works for me. This might encourage Alice to accept rather than risk losing the sale."
