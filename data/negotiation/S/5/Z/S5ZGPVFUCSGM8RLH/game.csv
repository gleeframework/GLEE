"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This would still represent a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price.  Let's find a number that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. This still allows you to get a great deal on a product worth a lot to you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
