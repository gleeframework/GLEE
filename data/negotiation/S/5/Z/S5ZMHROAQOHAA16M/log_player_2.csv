"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since Bob has 10 rounds to reach an agreement.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower than Alice's offer:**  Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Within Bob's budget:** The counteroffer stays within Bob's maximum budget of $15,000, ensuring he doesn't overspend.
* **Room for negotiation:** While the offer is low, it leaves room for potential compromise and ensures there's a starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it is still above Bob's desired price point.  Bob is still willing to negotiate further to reach a price closer to his budget. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating."
