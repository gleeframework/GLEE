"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the extra $3,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $12,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
