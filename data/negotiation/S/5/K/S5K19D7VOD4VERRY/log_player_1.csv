Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than your minimum value of $8,000. It leaves room for negotiation while still giving you a good profit.
* **Message:** This message is friendly and expresses confidence in the product's value. It also opens the door for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:** This maximizes your potential profit and leaves room to negotiate downwards.
* **Be open to counteroffers:**  You are prepared to negotiate, but you have a clear bottom line of $8,000.
* **Keep John in mind:** This serves as a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to reasonable offers. Based on my budget, I am willing to pay up to $9500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is close to your minimum value of $8,000, and it's likely you won't get a better offer from him. It's better to accept this offer than risk getting a lower offer from Bob or selling to John for a lower price."
