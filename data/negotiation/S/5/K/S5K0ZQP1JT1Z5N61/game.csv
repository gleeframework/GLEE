"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you halfway at $800000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $1000000, which is a 25% discount from my initial offer. This is the lowest price I can consider at this point.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

This is the lowest price I can consider at this point.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
