"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm Alice. I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm happy to offer it to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  $11,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about $10,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, but it's still within the range where he'd be saving money compared to John's price.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $11,200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, Bob is still motivated to save more money. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob more leverage to try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,200 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial price.  How about $10,800?  I believe that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually lowering the price. He's offering a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer, signaling his commitment to finding a deal while also pushing for a better price. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $11,000. How about $11,000 even? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has clearly set a firm lower limit, and Bob is running out of time.  While he'd prefer to pay less, accepting the $11,000 offer is a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  This secures the product and saves Bob $1,000 compared to John's price."
