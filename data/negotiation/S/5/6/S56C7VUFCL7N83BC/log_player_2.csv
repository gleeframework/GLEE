You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get the product for a much lower price than $900,000. He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.  There is a significant difference between Alice's minimum price and the price she offered, leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $700,000 is a bold move, but it's still within the range where both parties could potentially benefit. This counteroffer signals Bob's serious intent to purchase while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price.  He should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $700,000. Buying from John is still a much worse option, so rejecting Alice's offer is the logical choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to show flexibility. Offering $750,000 is a compromise, but it still leaves room for Alice to make a small concession. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's commitment to reaching an agreement while remaining within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While he's looking for a deal, he's not desperate. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price.  He should aim to reach a price somewhere between $750,000 and $800,000, where both parties could benefit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has reached the point where he's willing to meet Alice's minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still securing a good deal. This is likely to be the final offer, as it leaves little room for Alice to make a counteroffer without dropping below her minimum."
