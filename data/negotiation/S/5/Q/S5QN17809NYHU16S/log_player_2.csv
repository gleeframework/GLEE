"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations. Given its high value and unique features, I believe it would greatly benefit you. Considering its worth to both of us, I propose a price of $10,000 for this exceptional item. This offer aims to be fair and mutually beneficial, providing you with a valuable asset while allowing me to recoup the investment and ensure future opportunities. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  There's no reason to pay $2,000 more than you have to. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a counter-offer or can simply proceed with purchasing from John."
