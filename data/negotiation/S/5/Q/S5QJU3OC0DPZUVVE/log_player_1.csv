Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down in price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth without directly stating your minimum price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have any insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, passive), you can tailor your message accordingly.
* **Market Demand:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer, a quicker sale to Bob might be more desirable even at a slightly lower price. 

This offer aims to maximize your profit while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
