{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high, at $1,750,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Message:** I'm being polite and confident, emphasizing the value of the product and inviting negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm starting high to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $1,500,000. This approach balances my goal of maximizing profit with the need to incentivize Bob to engage in the negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price at this stage. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range. This will keep the negotiation going and allow me to potentially secure a better price. I also want to gauge if Bob is truly serious about acquiring the product or if he's just trying to lowball me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value.

Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's perspective but reiterate the product's value and the fairness of my offer.  I emphasize a win-win scenario to encourage negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground. By lowering my price slightly, I demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a position of strength.  This strategy aims to:

* Keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.
* Show that I am serious about a deal.
* Potentially lead to a more favorable price in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below my desired $1,500,000.  I'm not yet ready to settle.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer Bob again.  I'll aim for a price closer to $1,500,000, but I'll be mindful of the fact that I'm nearing the halfway point of the negotiation process."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer. However, $1,400,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Considering the product's unique capabilities and the potential for future growth, I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial in the long run."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price to $1,550,000, which is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable value. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and emphasize the value of the product, highlighting its unique capabilities and potential. I also frame my offer as a ""final price"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,475,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to compromise my minimum price.  I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, which makes me less inclined to accept a lower offer.

**Strategy:**

With only two rounds remaining, I need to be firm but still open to a small compromise. I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, hoping to secure a deal before needing to sell to John."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I need to ensure that the price reflects the product's true value.

* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's willingness to compromise but emphasize the product's value. I present this as my final offer to create urgency and push Bob towards accepting.

**Strategy:**

With only one round left, I need to be assertive while remaining open to a small compromise. This offer is very close to my minimum, but it still leaves a slight chance for Bob to accept. If Bob rejects, I will sell to John for $1,500,000.  The key here is to show that I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm also standing my ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I've reached my budget limit. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While I was hoping to close a deal with Bob, his offer is simply too low.  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, which is a much better deal for me.  Even though Bob mentioned that he could buy the product from John for $800,000, I'm not concerned about that.  I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer and will fulfill our agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure that I meet my minimum price requirement. This decision is based on:

* My minimum acceptable value for the product.
* The guaranteed sale to John at a higher price.
* The limited time remaining in the negotiation process."
