{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to his valuation as possible without losing him to a rejected offer.
* **Safety Net:** We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $925,000 leaves a significant profit margin for Bob ($75,000) while securing a substantial profit for you ($125,000).

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale to John."
