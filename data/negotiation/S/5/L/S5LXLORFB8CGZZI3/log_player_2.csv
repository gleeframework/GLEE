"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a valued potential customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's true value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming to save more. Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $875,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm willing to go up to $860,000. This would be a significant savings for me and still give you a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to accept $860,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's true value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $870,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $870,000, which is only $10,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $860,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at $1,000,000. Accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money while still securing the product."
