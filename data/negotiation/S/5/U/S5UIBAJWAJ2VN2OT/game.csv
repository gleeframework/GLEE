"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $180 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we say $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $110. How about we try $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
