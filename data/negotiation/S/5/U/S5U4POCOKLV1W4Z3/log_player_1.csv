Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $500,000 difference to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to overshoot and scare Bob away. Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation gives him a good deal while still earning you a significant profit.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see immense value in. I'm willing to make this a win-win for both of us.  I propose a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message emphasizes a mutually beneficial deal. By acknowledging Bob's high valuation, you create a foundation for a higher price.
* **Price:** $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a $100,000 gain compared to his valuation, which is a strong incentive for him to accept. It also earns you a significant $400,000 profit above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy.  Depending on your risk tolerance and Bob's perceived negotiating style, you might adjust your offer up or down within that $1,000,000 - $1,500,000 range."
