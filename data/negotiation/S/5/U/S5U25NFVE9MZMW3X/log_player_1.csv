Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you and I'm happy to offer it to you for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $20,000, I'm trying to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value closer to my own.  
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial offer will help me gauge Bob's interest level and potential willingness to pay. 
 
I know $20,000 is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives us a starting point for negotiation. I'm prepared to lower my price, but I want to see what Bob counters with first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly his perceived value and significantly below my minimum of $15,000. While I could accept John's offer now, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some space for bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher to me. I could consider letting it go for $18,000."", ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I significantly decreased my initial offer, moving closer to the middle ground between our initial positions. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Above Minimum:** I'm still aiming for a price above my absolute minimum ($15,000), leaving room for further negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number; I'm reiterating that the product holds a higher inherent value for me, justifying the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $14,000 is below my ideal price, but it's higher than my absolute minimum of $15,000.  

* **Profitable:** Accepting this offer still nets me a profit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has the potential for a higher price, but also the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable outcome.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but closing the deal now with Bob avoids potential delays and ensures a quicker sale. 
 
While I could push for a bit more, I think accepting $14,000 strikes a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
