**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,500,000.  While I could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk he won't budge. Accepting his offer guarantees a $500,000 profit, which is a significant return. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him altogether and settling for John's $1,000,000 offer."
