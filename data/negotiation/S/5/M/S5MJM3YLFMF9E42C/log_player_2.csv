# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be very valuable to you.  While I can't disclose specifics without a non-disclosure agreement, I'm confident it has the potential to significantly benefit your business. I'm offering it to you for $1500000, a price that reflects its potential value.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can schedule a call to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, as that's above my budget of $800,000. I'll look elsewhere.
