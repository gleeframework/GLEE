"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $130 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $130? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $132.50. It's a fair price, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really close to my budget limit, and I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase right now.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to your budget limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $132. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we meet at $131? It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to find a mutually beneficial deal.",131.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $131, but I'm still just a little over my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now. Let's make this happen.",130.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really close to your budget limit, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $130. I'm willing to throw in a small bonus, though. If you're willing to pay $130, I'll include a free accessory that's worth $10. It's a great value, and I think it's a fair deal.
