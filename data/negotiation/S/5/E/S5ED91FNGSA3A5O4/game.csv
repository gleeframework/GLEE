"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle and sell it to me for $11000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm thinking of offering $12500. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $13500, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give away the value of the product. I'm going to stand firm at my original offer of $12000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm willing to explore other options.",12000.0,Alice,9,
