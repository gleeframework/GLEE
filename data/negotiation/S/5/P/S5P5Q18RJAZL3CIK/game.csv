"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,250,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a fair profit. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000. How about $1,190,000? This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
