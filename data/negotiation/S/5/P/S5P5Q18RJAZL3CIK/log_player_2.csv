{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,250,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a fair profit.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,250,000 is still above my maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price before considering John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000. How about $1,190,000? This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,190,000 is getting closer to my target price but is still a bit too high.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before potentially considering John's offer."
