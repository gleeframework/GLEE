{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still space for Bob to counteroffer without making it feel like he's getting a terrible deal.
* **It shows you're serious:** By offering a price, you're demonstrating your commitment to the sale, while still leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your desired price point and leaves room for further negotiation. You can likely secure a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,150?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 11150} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,150. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,000? That's the highest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good deal. It's higher than John's offer, and it's close enough to your desired price point to make it worthwhile.  Further negotiation could potentially yield a slightly higher price, but there's a risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a good price."
