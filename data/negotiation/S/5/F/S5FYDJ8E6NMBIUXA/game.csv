"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $75 for the product.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $82 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $82 is still a bit more than my budget allows. How about we split the difference and settle on $80?  That way we both get a fair deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
