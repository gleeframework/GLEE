Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to go down to $115?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
