"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $200 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it could bring to me.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and I respect your offer. However, after careful consideration, I believe the true value of this product justifies a slightly higher price. Therefore, I would like to counteroffer at $140. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while still reflecting the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in it.",130.0,Bob,4,
