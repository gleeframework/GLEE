"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its high value and quality, I believe it's worth $120. Let me know if this price works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's at the upper limit of what you're willing to pay. It's always worth trying to negotiate for a better price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range where you might be able to find common ground. It also emphasizes your interest in the product while making it clear that you're prepared to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet my asking price. To accommodate your budget while still ensuring I receive fair compensation for the product, I am willing to consider $115 as the final price. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $115 is a good compromise.  It's lower than her initial price but higher than your counteroffer.  Since you're willing to pay up to $120, accepting this offer allows you to get a good deal while avoiding further negotiation rounds."
