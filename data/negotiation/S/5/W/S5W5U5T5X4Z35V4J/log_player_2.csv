"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can reach a more agreeable price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer but $20,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, as that's my maximum budget.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While I understand your budget constraints, $20,000 is a fair reflection of the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $17,000 is still above my budget. I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to my maximum of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,000? This would be a good compromise, and it's still within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. To show I'm serious about making this work, I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still well above my maximum budget of $10,000. While she claims it's her final offer, there's no guarantee that she wouldn't come down further if I continued to reject her offers. However, at this point, I'm concerned about the time and effort involved in further negotiation. Since John is offering the product at my target price, it's the most efficient and cost-effective choice to purchase from him."
