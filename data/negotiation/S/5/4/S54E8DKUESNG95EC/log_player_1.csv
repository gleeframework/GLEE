Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000).
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $19,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  The slightly ""off-round"" number of $19,000 might make it seem like a more considered price than a flat $20,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit. However,  there's always a chance Bob might outright reject the offer without negotiation. You'll need to weigh the risk of losing him as a buyer against the potential for a higher profit."
