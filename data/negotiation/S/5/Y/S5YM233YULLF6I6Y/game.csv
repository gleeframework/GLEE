"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we agree on $10,500 and call it a deal?",10500.0,Bob,4,
