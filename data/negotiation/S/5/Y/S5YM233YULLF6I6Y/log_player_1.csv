Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob still has room to bargain and potentially make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This gives Bob a reason to counteroffer, allowing you to potentially push the price higher.

Remember, if Bob rejects your offer, you'll have to decide whether to accept his counteroffer or sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than $8,000, you still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to your target price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Show that you're willing to negotiate:** This keeps Bob engaged and signals that you're not desperate to sell for his first offer.
* **Potentially get a higher price:**  By counteroffering, you can push for a price closer to your ideal $12,000.

Remember, you can always sell to John for $8,000, so you're not taking a huge risk by rejecting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good option for the following reasons:

* **It's a compromise:** It's in the middle of your previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** This demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.

Remember, you can always fall back to selling to John for $8,000 if Bob rejects this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we agree on $10,500 and call it a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best choice:

* **Close to your target:** $10,500 is only $500 less than your initial target of $11,000. 
* **Higher than John's offer:** This is significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.
* **Limited room for improvement:**  It's unlikely Bob will increase his offer significantly further. 

While you could counteroffer, it's possible that Bob might walk away, leaving you with the $8,000 offer from John. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a higher price and secures the sale."
