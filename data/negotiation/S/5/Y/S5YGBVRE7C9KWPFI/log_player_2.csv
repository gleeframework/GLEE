"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is too high.  You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  Given your value of $800,000, I think a price of $950,000 would be a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $950,000 is a significant offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what you're aiming for.  You've already shown willingness to negotiate and can likely get a better deal with further counteroffers.  Rejecting allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my ideal range. Given that you value the product at $800,000, I believe a price of $975,000 would be a fair compromise. This would allow for a good profit for you while still being within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
