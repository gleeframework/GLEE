"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  Given your value of $800,000, I think a price of $950,000 would be a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $950,000 is a significant offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my ideal range. Given that you value the product at $800,000, I believe a price of $975,000 would be a fair compromise. This would allow for a good profit for you while still being within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to agree on $1,012,500.  This is a very competitive offer considering the value this product brings.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,012,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $990,000.  This offer is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's fair given your value for the product.  Let's close this deal!",990000.0,Bob,6,
