{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's fair for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  How about $110? It's still a great price for a product worth more, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Can we agree on $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm running the risk of getting stuck in a negotiation that might drag on.  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids any further negotiation."
