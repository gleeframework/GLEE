"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $160? This gives us both a fair deal.",160.0,Alice,3,
