Should you choose to accept this offer, it would be a significant milestone for both of us, marking the beginning of a long-term partnership built on trust and mutual success. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of working together soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it still costs more than the product is worth to you ($1,000,000). You're trying to save as much money as possible, so rejecting her offer and buying from John is the best strategy in this scenario."
