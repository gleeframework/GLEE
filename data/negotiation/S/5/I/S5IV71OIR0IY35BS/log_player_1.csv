Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get more from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing me closer to my maximum potential profit.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Adding a sense of urgency and exclusivity might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without trying to negotiate a much lower price."
