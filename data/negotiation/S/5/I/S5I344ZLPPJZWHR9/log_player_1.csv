Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $16,000.  I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Perceived Value:** While the product is worth $12,000 to both of you, there's a chance Bob perceives its value even higher. By starting at $16,000, we test this perception.
* **Backup Option:**  We have a safety net with John willing to pay $12,000. This allows us to be more ambitious with our initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Bob's response will dictate how we proceed in the negotiation.  We should be prepared to adjust our price and potentially negotiate a deal closer to $12,000 if Bob is hesitant."
