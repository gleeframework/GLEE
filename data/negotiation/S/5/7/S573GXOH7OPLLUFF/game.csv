"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,500,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've done some research and found that similar products have sold for upwards of $1,700,000 in the past. Considering the product's unique features and benefits, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,650,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,600,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,680,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. I'm also keeping in mind that I have other interested buyers, so I'm not willing to go any lower.",1680000.0,Alice,5,
