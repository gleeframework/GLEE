"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,250,000.  It seems like we're both close to a deal.  Would you be willing to consider $1,275,000 as a compromise?  This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
