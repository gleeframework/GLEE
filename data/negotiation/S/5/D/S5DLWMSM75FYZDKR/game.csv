"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $12,500 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,500?  I think that would be a fair price.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I must respectfully decline it. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,500 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to its value, while ensuring we receive a fair compensation for it.",11500.0,Alice,3,
