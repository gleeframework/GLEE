Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire my product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to exploring possibilities that are mutually beneficial."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the opportunity to purchase your product. After careful consideration, I am interested in discussing a more reasonable price. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Bob's offer is better than losing the deal altogether, but it's still significantly below my minimum. I believe there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting your counterproposal. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product to the right buyer is truly significant. I'm willing to move from my initial offer, but $1,200,000 is too low.  Could you consider $1,900,000? I believe that's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,900,000 price. I would like to propose an offer of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is now offering more than my fallback option of John. It's a good deal and there's no guarantee I can negotiate him up further."
