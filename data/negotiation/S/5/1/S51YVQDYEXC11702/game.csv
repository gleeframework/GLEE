"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's aim for a price closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $937,500. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",937500.0,Alice,5,
