Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $95 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you get a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation. If he negotiates, you can potentially still sell it for more than $80.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
