"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise!",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $950,000?  That's a good compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that still benefits me, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
