Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Gives Bob a good deal:** He gets the product for $2,000 less than its value to him.
* **Offers you a good profit:** You earn $2,000 more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still negotiate further without significantly jeopardizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and it's a good compromise considering his previous rejection. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids further negotiation."
