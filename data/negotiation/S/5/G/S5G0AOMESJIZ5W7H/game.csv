"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. Can you meet me in the middle?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but $6,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's a fair price for such a high-quality product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,200 is still quite a bit below my asking price. To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I value our interaction, so I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is my final offer - take it or leave it.",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I've already looked at other options and I can get the same product from John for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and go up to $7,000, but that's my final offer. Can you reconsider?",7000.0,Bob,6,
