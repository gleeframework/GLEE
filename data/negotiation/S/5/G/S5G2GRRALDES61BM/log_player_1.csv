I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I think I can still get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to counter with $11,250. This is a compromise, but still leaves a decent profit margin for me.  It's close enough to Bob's offer that I'm hopeful he'll accept."
