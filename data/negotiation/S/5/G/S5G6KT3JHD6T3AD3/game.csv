"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $9500? It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a lower offer of $8500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my expenses. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle again? I'll sell the product to you for $9000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $8750. I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's the best price we can both agree on. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8750?",8750.0,Bob,6,
