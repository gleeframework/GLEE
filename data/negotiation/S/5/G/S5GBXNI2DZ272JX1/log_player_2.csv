"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $950,000. This represents a significant value proposition for you, given its worth to you. Let's start the negotiation with this offer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice is offering it for $950,000. There is room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price.
* **Time is on your side:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so you have time to explore options and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good value for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offering. Let's meet halfway -  I'm willing to sell for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target price of $850,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** You have time and can continue to negotiate.  There's a chance Alice might come down further if you reject this offer.
* **Avoiding unnecessary expense:**  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a last resort, and you should continue to try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to pay $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  I'm hopeful we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $887,500. This would give you a great deal on a product that's worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial price of $950,000. 
* **Fair deal:** $887,500 is a reasonable compromise, especially considering you are willing to pay up to $1,000,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's not guaranteed. Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away or John changing his price. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting the offer at $887,500 secures a good deal and avoids unnecessary risk."
