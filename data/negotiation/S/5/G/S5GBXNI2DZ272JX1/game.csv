"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good value for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offering. Let's meet halfway -  I'm willing to sell for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to pay $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  I'm hopeful we can close the deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $887,500. This would give you a great deal on a product that's worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal at this price.",887500.0,Alice,5,
