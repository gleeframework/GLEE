"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still get the product for less than $800,000 from John, so there's no need to settle for $900,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice $750,000 for the product. This is significantly lower than her asking price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also keeps me well below my own maximum price of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer of $850,000 is within my budget and is a better price than buying from John. Accepting this offer allows me to save money and get the product without further negotiation."
