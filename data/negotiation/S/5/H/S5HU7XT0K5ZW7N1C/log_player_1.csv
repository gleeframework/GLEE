Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $14,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $18,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $18,000. I'm willing to meet you at $16,500, as I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is offering $16,500. This is a reasonable profit above my minimum ($15,000) and there's no guarantee I can negotiate him higher. Accepting ensures a good deal.
