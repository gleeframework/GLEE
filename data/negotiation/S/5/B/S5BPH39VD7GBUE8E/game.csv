"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a fortune and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth to both of us.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this time.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would still leave a substantial profit for me and represent a great deal for you. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. To move forward, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
