Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a substantial offer for Bob, while still leaving you with a significant profit. However, I'm ready to adjust if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While selling to John for $800,000 is tempting, I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price with a counter-offer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but not too much.  $850,000 is still a good deal for Bob, and it's closer to the value I'm hoping for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial price, Bob seems unwilling to budge much further. Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me a profit and is the best option at this point."
