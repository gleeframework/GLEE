"Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140.",140.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $135. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $130, but I was thinking maybe we could meet at $132. That's the lowest I can go.",132.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $137. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",137.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $135, but I was thinking maybe we could meet at $136. That's the lowest I can go.",136.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $136, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $139. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",139.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm willing to go up to $139, Alice. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $135, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",135.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $139 and $135, which is $137. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",137.0,Alice,9,
