"Hi Alice, thanks for offering. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $95?  That's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line. How about we split the difference at $97.50? It seems like a fair deal for both of us.",97.5,Bob,6,
