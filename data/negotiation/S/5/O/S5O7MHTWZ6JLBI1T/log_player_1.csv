Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000,  there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it, especially if it's something he needs or highly desires.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy involves some risk. There's a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. However, since you have a fallback option with John, you're not risking losing the base value of the product."
