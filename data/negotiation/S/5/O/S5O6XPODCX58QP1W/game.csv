"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. I believe this price reflects the value I see and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $875,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $860,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can close this gap.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $860,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $880,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $880,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $870,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",870000.0,Bob,6,
