{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's value to make him more interested.

This approach allows me to:

* **Maximize Potential Earnings:**  The higher starting price gives me more room to negotiate down.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will give me an indication of how much he values the product.
* **Maintain Optionality:** If Bob doesn't accept, I still have the option to counteroffer or sell to John."
