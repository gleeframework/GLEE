"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking $20000 for it.  Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $10000. Would you be willing to consider $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $12000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $17000 to make this work.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really pushing my budget here, but I'm willing to go up to $14000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation.  $14000 is getting closer to what I need. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $15500. This would be a great price for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this deal happen!",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $14750.  Let's close this deal!",14750.0,Bob,6,
