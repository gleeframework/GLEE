Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your ideal price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies it's worth the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:** By stating she'll list it publicly, Alice creates a sense of urgency and scarcity.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation alive.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit but carries the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.
* Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters, or be willing to sell to John at her minimum price."
