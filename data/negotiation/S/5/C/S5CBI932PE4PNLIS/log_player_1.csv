Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is offering the absolute minimum I would accept. There's no room for negotiation left.
