"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500. This is my best offer and I hope we can come to an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still too much for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $16,250. This is a fair compromise and hopefully, we can close the deal.",16250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,250 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $16,750. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",16750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $16,750 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $16,500.  This is my final offer and I hope we can reach an agreement.",16500.0,Bob,6,
