``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's valuation, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows for potential back-and-forth, maximizing my chances of getting a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500. This is my best offer and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still too much for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $16,250. This is a fair compromise and hopefully, we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,250 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $16,750.

Round 6
