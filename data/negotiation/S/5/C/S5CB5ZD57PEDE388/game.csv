"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I've taken your offer into consideration, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1400000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about the long-term value of this deal.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my own needs. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1300000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
