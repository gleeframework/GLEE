"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $950,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $900,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $875,000.  This feels like a fair price considering our both our goals. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can see that $875,000 is still a bit below my target. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. Let's try $925,000. I think it's a good balance between our interests. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
