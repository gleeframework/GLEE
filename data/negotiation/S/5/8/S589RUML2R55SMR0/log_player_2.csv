"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. Let's start with a price of $950,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for the lowest possible price.  $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's best to reject the initial offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $950,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $900,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to Bob's desired price, $900,000 is still more than Bob's budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to push the price down further.  He's still early in the negotiation process, and there's no immediate need to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $875,000.  This feels like a fair price considering our both our goals. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can see that $875,000 is still a bit below my target. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. Let's try $925,000. I think it's a good balance between our interests. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still too high for Bob, and the negotiation isn't moving in a direction that suggests a quick resolution.  The risk is that the negotiation could drag on, and Bob might run out of rounds.  At this point, it's better for Bob to secure the product from John for $800,000 and avoid any further uncertainty."
