I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to see if he's genuinely interested and gives me room to negotiate.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm reducing my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while also maintaining my position.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
