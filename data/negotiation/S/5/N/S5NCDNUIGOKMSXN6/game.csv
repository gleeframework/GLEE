"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a fair starting point.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground.  To be honest, $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $975,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I understand that you have a bottom line. While $1,075,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
