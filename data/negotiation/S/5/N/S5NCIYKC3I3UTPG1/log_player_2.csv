"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and your interest, I propose a price of $12,000 for it. This offer is exclusive to you and includes a limited-time discount. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still above his maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob a chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering your budget and the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My proposal is to offer the product for $11,500. This price reflects a reasonable compromise while still allowing us to maintain a positive business relationship. I hope this suggestion is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than he wants to pay.  He can try to negotiate a lower price further by rejecting this offer. There are still several rounds remaining, and he might be able to reach a price closer to his $10,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  My final offer is $11,000.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
