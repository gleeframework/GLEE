Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's estimated value but still lower than my minimum desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially finding a middle ground.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob's interest. 

**Reasoning:**

* I want to maximize my profit while still considering Bob's potential willingness to pay.
* A $14,000 offer allows for potential counteroffers and negotiation without immediately triggering a rejection from Bob.
* If Bob rejects, I can always counter with a lower price or sell to John for my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome, rejecting Bob's offer allows me to potentially negotiate a better price. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** Even though Bob's offer is too low, his interest in the product suggests there's room for negotiation. I can counteroffer at a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I avoid accepting a significantly lower price and potentially secure a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $10,500 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle. I'd accept $12,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would make this transaction possible. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my desired price of $15,000.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and encourages further negotiation, emphasizing a ""fair"" price that benefits both parties.
* **Reasoning:**
    * I'm aiming for a compromise that is closer to my desired price while still considering Bob's initial offer.
    * Offering $12,000 could make Bob more willing to negotiate and increase the chances of a successful sale.
    * This counter-offer allows for a middle ground without immediately resorting to the fallback option of selling to John."
