Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's fair given its potential. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
