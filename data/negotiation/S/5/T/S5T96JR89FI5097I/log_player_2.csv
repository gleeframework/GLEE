"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a strong offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, given the value we both see in the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $1,250,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $1,200,000.
* **It's a better deal than buying from John:** While John offers a lower price, Alice's offer still saves Bob $50,000.
* **Further negotiation might be futile:**  Alice has already lowered her price, and further negotiation might lead to a deadlock or a situation where Bob ends up buying from John anyway."
