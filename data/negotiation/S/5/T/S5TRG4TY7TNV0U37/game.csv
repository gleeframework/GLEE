"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1000000.0
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can do $950,000, which is a compromise between our two numbers.",950000.0,Alice,3,,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob. Meeting in the middle was a good idea. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $975,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but I think that's as high as I can go.",980000.0,Alice,5,,
