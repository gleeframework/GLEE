Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

It's time to cut bait. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $980,000, and you have a guaranteed option at $1,000,000 with John. While you could try to haggle Alice down a bit more, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of her sticking to her price."
