Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than the value to Bob, knowing he'll likely counteroffer. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me some room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price point. I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price, but I won't settle for less than $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm countering with $850,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to his value and my minimum, increasing the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is too low, and I'm starting to feel like this negotiation isn't going anywhere.  I'm not willing to drop my price further, so I'm going to sell to John for $800,000.  It's not the best outcome, but it's better than settling for less than my minimum."
