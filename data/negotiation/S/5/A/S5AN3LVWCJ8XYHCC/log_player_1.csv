"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product!  Given its value and the benefit you'll gain, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $19,000 is quite steep for me.  I'm thinking closer to $10,000 would be a fair price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?"", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $15,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you consider $12,000? I believe that's a reasonable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
 
At this point, Bob is holding firm at his maximum perceived value ($12,000).  It's unlikely he'll go higher, and further negotiation could be fruitless. Selling to John guarantees the best possible outcome for me."
