"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product. My asking price is $1,150,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  The product's value to you is significantly higher, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,050,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to negotiate further.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we meet halfway at $975,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering where we both started.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $975,000 is tempting, I'm still not quite there.  How about $1,025,000? It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident this deal can be finalized.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $990,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon.",990000.0,Bob,6,
