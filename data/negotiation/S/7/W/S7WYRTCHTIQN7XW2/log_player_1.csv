Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm open to negotiation and will consider his counteroffer.  If he rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.  Of course, I also have the option to sell to John at any time for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is very close to my initial offer and it's more profitable than selling to John. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
