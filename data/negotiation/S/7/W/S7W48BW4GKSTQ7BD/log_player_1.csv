I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. I've made a few counteroffers, and Bob is stuck at $130.  There's a good chance I could get him to budge to $135 in the next round, but I don't want to risk going through more rounds of negotiation. It's better to secure the $150 now and avoid any further uncertainty."
