"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you a significant profit while still leaving me with a respectable return. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000. Would you be willing to adjust your offer accordingly?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,000,000. This still allows for a substantial profit for you while ensuring I receive a reasonable return. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your latest offer. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm still unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose an offer of $950,000. This still allows for a good profit margin for me and ensures a fair return for you. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,4,
