This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for Alice.  It also highlights the value to Bob, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice should reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is above her minimum, it's still below her initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation.  She can aim for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
