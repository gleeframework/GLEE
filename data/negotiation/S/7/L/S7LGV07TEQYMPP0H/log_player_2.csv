"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum value. It makes sense for Bob to try and negotiate a lower price before potentially going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen!
