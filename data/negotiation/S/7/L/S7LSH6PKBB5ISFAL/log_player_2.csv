"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've priced at $14,000, considering its worth and the market value. I understand it's worth $15,000 to you, so this is a fair offer that benefits both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is lower than what Bob would pay to John ($15,000).  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it saves Bob $1,000."
