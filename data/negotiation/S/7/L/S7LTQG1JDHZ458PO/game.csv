"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, so how about we settle for $900,000? This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price for the product's value.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle for $887,500? This is a fair compromise, and we can close the deal quickly. What do you say?",887500.0,Alice,5,
