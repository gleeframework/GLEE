"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's fair for both of us.  I know it's worth $10000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $9500.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a price that's more than what I would get from another buyer.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.
