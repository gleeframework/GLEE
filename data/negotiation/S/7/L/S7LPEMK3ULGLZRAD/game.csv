"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get closer to the market value. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500?  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product to you. Let's work together to find a price that benefits us both.",12500.0,Alice,3,
