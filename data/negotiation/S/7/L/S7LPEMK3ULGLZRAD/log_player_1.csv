Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get closer to the market value. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to negotiate with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $12,500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to pay a bit more to get it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $12,500.  I'll try to negotiate further with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $11,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you.  Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,800. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Bob might walk away entirely, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from him.  To guarantee a sale and a decent profit, I'm going to sell the product to John."
