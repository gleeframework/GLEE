"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a one-of-a-kind product that I'm confident you'll love, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay $15,000 for the product from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price. By rejecting, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or get a better deal from another seller."
