Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $1200000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1750000? This is a significant price point for me, but I want to see if we can find a middle ground.

Alice's offer of $1,750,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm going to reject this offer and continue to negotiate.  I have room to counter-offer again before potentially turning to John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're willing to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to go to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  $1400000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  Let's make this deal happen!
