"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1200000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is too low, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer. I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $1,200,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,750,000? This is a significant price point for me, but I want to see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're willing to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to go to $1400000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm happy with. I want to see if I can get closer to my target and explore another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm committed to getting this deal done, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1400000. I think this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is too close to my minimum. I'm not comfortable accepting a price that low.  Selling to John at $1,500,000 is a more acceptable outcome at this point."
