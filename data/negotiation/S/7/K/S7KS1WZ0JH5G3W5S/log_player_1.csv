Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's worth to Bob, increasing his perceived value and justifying the price. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides leverage. You can afford to be a bit bolder in your offer to Bob."
