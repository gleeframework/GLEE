"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  It's important to start strong to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell immediately. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for further discussion. I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and willing to pay something closer to my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is dropping his offer lower than my minimum.  I'm going to reject this offer and counter with something closer to my minimum.  I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my initial asking price and don't want to settle for anything too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to go higher. With only 5 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm holding out for a slightly better deal than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is consistently offering less than my minimum. I've already made several concessions, and we are running out of time.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's my minimum and I'm not willing to risk getting a lower offer from Bob."
