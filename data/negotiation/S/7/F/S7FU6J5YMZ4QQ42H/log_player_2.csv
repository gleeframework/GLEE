"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible.  Offering $13,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good deal for himself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob can try to negotiate further to get a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to budge, as she is already at a higher price than her desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  Offering $13,500 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. This shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to his ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is now just $100 lower than John's price. While continuing to negotiate might get a slightly better price, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer again and the potential for further rounds of counteroffers means that it's likely not worth it.  At this point, it's more efficient to simply buy from John and avoid further delays and uncertainty."
