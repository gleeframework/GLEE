Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree that this product is valuable, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price reflects the value I see in it while still being fair to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob's offer:
