"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree that this product is valuable, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price reflects the value I see in it while still being fair to you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to consider a more reasonable price. After reviewing the situation, I would like to propose a price of $875,000 for the product. This price still allows us to maintain a fair value for both parties involved. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the adjustment. I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $825,000? I think that's a fair compromise and would allow us to close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
