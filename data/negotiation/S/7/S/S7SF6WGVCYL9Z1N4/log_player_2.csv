"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than your maximum price and more expensive than buying from John. You can get a better deal by rejecting her offer and going with John."
