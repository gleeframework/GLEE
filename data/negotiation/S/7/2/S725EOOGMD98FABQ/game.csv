"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Let's start with $8500.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer, Alice, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $8750.  That's a significant discount from your initial offer and a fair compromise.  What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9250, which is still a good profit for me, but closer to your target price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, and meet you at $9100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10000.",9100.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $9000, which is my final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.  Let's make this happen.",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make this work, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9100. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a free maintenance package, which is a $500 value. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9100.0,Alice,9,
