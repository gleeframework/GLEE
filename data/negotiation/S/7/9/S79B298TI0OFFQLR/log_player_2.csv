"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than your maximum price. It makes sense to negotiate and try to get a better deal.  You always have the option to buy from John for $8,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $7,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in a negotiation. This leaves you room to move upwards while still aiming for a price well below your $8,000 maximum.
* **Polite and Positive:**  The message remains courteous and expresses continued interest, fostering a good negotiating environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John's Price:** Alice's offer of $8,200 is better than her initial offer but still more expensive than buying from John.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There are several rounds left, giving you opportunities to negotiate a lower price.  Alice has shown willingness to move from her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $8,200 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be open to $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** By offering $7,500, you're showing Alice you're willing to move upwards while still staying below your $8,000 limit and John's price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge how much further down Alice is willing to go. 
* **Maintaining Communication:**  Keeping the conversation going in a positive tone is key to reaching a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. If you're interested, let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches John's Price:** Alice has come down to your fallback price of $8,000. There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation or buying from John at the same price. 
* **Secures the Deal:** Accepting now guarantees you get the product at the desired price. Delaying further could risk Alice changing her mind or other factors coming into play."
