"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I can only go as high as $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my bottom line.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate the movement. How about $1,150,000? That's a serious offer.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $1,200,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good starting point for a final agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
