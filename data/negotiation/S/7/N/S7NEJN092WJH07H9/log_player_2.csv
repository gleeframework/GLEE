"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $12,000. The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, meaning there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the lowest possible price.  He's offering $10,500, which is just slightly above Alice's minimum price of $10,000. This counteroffer is likely to be attractive to Alice, as she'll still make a profit, and it leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a better price than John's offer, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $10,500.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob another opportunity to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to his ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He increases his offer from $10,500 to $11,500,  which is still lower than Alice's current offer of $13,000. This shows a willingness to compromise, while still trying to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer slightly to $13,200, but it's still significantly lower than John's offer of $15,000. While Bob could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are diminishing. It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a price he's comfortable with. Further negotiation might not result in a substantially better price, and the risk of Alice withdrawing her offer or Bob losing out to John is too high."
