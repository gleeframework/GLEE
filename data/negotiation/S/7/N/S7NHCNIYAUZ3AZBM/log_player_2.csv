"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $100 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $90. 
* You can potentially get a better price by rejecting and counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $90 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $88.  Let's split the difference and make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $88 is within my budget of $100.
*  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might not budge or the negotiation could drag on.
* Buying from John for $100 would be more expensive.
* Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and avoids further negotiation."
