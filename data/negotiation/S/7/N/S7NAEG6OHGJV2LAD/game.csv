"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the product's unique value, I'm willing to come down to $1650000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in continuing the negotiation.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
