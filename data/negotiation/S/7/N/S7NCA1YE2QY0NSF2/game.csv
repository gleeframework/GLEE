"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for us to discuss.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? That feels like a fairer price point.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $950,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's split the difference â€“ $1,000,000.  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
