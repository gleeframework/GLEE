Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? That feels like a fairer price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
