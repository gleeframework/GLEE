Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $100 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, can you meet me at $110? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really like this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $110. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum of $120 and it seems like Bob is serious about buying the product. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
