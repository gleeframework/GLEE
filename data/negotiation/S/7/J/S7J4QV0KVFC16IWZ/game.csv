"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my target price. I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  Would you consider $10,500? I believe that's a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in making this deal work.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that the product's value is still worth more than that.",11200.0,Alice,5,
