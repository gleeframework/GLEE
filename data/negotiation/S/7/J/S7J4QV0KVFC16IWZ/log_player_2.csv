"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above my target of saving as much money as possible. I'll start by rejecting the offer and see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping to get it lower. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my target price. I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  Would you consider $10,500? I believe that's a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in making this deal work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that the product's value is still worth more than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a little closer to my price, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. It's getting risky to keep pushing, and while $11,200 is still a bit more than my ideal, it's a reasonable price considering the value of the product. I'm going to accept the offer and avoid the risk of needing to buy from John for a higher price."
