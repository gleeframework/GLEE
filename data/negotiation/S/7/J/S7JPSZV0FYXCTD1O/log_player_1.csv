Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm confident it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering a price higher than $12,000, you signal that you're open to negotiation. This gives Bob the impression that he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down even slightly. 
* **Confident Language:** Using language like ""valuable"" and ""confident"" reinforces the product's worth in Bob's mind, potentially justifying the higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John, so don't feel pressured to accept anything less."
