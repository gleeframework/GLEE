Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Attractive to Bob:**  The price is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($120), but the message frames it as a ""deal,"" potentially enticing him. 

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing potential profit."
