"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
