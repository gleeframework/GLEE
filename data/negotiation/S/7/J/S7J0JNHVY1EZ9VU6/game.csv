"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  Would you consider $1,225,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the potential benefits you'll gain.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I'll gain from the product. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
