"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $14000 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?,10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to compromise at $13000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to walk away from. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the price, to be honest. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please reconsider.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and $11000, which is $12000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $11000, which is $11500. That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",11500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go that high, Bob. I think we're getting close to the product's value, but I'm still not convinced you're willing to meet me at a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $11500, which is $11750. That's the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll pay $11000 for the product, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please reconsider.",11000.0,Bob,10,
