"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further.  A counteroffer gives you the chance to secure a better price without losing the opportunity to buy from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll gain from owning this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is within my budget and a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away or I might end up paying more than $1,100,000.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
