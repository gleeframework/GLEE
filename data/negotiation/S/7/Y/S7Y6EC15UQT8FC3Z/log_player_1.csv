Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
