Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my limits. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This price acknowledges the product's worth while staying within my budget.  Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,000,000 mark.  At this stage, taking John's guaranteed offer is the most logical choice to maximize profit."
