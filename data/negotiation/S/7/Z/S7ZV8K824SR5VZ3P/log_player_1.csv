Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This sets a strong baseline and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me a solid fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail.
* **Assessing Bob's Value:**  By observing Bob's reaction and any counteroffers, I can gauge how much he values the product and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is significantly closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation and a possibility of getting closer to my initial asking price.
* **Avoiding Settlement:**  Accepting Bob's offer now might leave money on the table, especially if I believe his value for the product is higher.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price. I will carefully consider Bob's initial offer and my estimate of his perceived value when making my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price of $1,350,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** This price is in the middle of my initial offer ($1,500,000) and Bob's offer ($1,200,000). This increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Maintaining Value:** The price is still significantly higher than John's offer, making this a more advantageous deal.

I believe this counteroffer presents a good balance between achieving a favorable price and maintaining the possibility of closing the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lower Offer:**  Bob's latest offer is now significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than John's offer. This indicates that he might not be willing to pay a price that I find acceptable. 
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better result, as his counteroffers are steadily decreasing.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob will take time and effort, and there's a high chance of ending up with a lower price than John's offer.

**Conclusion:**

To maximize my profit and avoid further negotiation with Bob, the best choice is to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This guarantees a solid price and avoids the risk of getting a worse deal with Bob."
