Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000).  This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value and hints at wider availability if Bob doesn't take the deal.
* **Alternative:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage.  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm not losing out. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes I don't know Bob's absolute maximum willingness to pay. 
* There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, starting with a strong offer maximizes potential profit."
