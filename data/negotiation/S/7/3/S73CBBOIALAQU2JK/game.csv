"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $950000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $950000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit, and I believe it's a good starting point for finding a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
