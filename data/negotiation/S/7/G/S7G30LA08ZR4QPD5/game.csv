,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is simply too low.  It's clear you value the product, and I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,050,000?  This allows for a good profit for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, meeting you halfway. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
