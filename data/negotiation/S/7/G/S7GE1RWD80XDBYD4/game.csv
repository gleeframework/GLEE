"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product but $1,300,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,200,000 is closer, but I'm trying to keep it under $1,100,000.  Would you be willing to sell for $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I can offer you a price of $1,150,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
