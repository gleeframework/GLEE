"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering the current market.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm willing to work with you to find a fair price.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000?  This gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows how serious I am about purchasing this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $1,025,000? This shows I'm serious about closing the deal while recognizing the value of the product.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I need, but $1,025,000 isn't quite there yet. To be honest, I'd feel better closing this deal at $1,075,000. This allows both of us to walk away happy with a solid deal. Let's make this happen.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
