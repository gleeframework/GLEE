"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, you have room to negotiate and save more money. 
* **You have 10 rounds:** You have time to explore better options and work towards a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and offers you a fair return."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she's come down from her initial price, it's still above your desired price point.
* **You have more time to negotiate:** You've only had 3 rounds, and you have 7 more to potentially secure a better price.
* **John's offer is a backup:** You can always go with John if the negotiations with Alice don't work out in your favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a compromise.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer and still leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price:**  You've already secured a significant discount from the initial $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of going higher:**  There's a risk that Alice will become more firm if you keep rejecting her offers, and you could end up paying closer to her original price.
* **Time is ticking:** You've already had 5 rounds, and you don't want to risk running out of time to close the deal.
* **John's price is higher:**  Alice's offer is still a better deal than buying from John. 

By accepting Alice's offer, you can secure the product at a price that's within your budget and saves you a significant amount of money compared to John's offer."
