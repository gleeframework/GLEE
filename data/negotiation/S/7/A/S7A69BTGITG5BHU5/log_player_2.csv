"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a significant savings and I get a better price than my backup buyer. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a bit high. You know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity to negotiate a lower price with her or, if necessary, buy from John and still stay within your budget."
