Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to maximize potential profit.  It also gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counter-offers. 

I'll keep in mind that I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John if I need to move on.  I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial offer, but it's still within my acceptable range since I can get $800,000 from John. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'll use the next round to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for him to accept, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has moved up from his previous offer to $825,000. This is a significant increase, and while it's still not my ideal price, it's closer than his previous offer and only $25,000 less than John's offer.  It's more important to close the deal than to risk losing the sale altogether.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $825,000."
