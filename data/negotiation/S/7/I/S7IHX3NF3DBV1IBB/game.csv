"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Considering your offer of $90, I can meet you halfway and offer $105. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find the product worth the investment.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $95.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at that price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another compromise. Considering your offer of $95, I can offer $98. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",98.0,Alice,5,
