{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to your maximum, it's still slightly over your target. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money. You have 9 more rounds to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1199000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is $1001 less than Alice's offer, which is a significant reduction. This shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal and are willing to negotiate. It also leaves room for further bargaining if necessary."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $1,200,000. While it's a bit lower than her first offer, it's still too high. It's better to continue negotiating to see if you can get a better price.  You have 7 more rounds to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows Alice that you're willing to meet her halfway, but still aim for a price closer to your maximum. This could potentially lead to a quicker agreement, especially as you have only six rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting higher, not lower. You have already rejected several offers and have only five rounds remaining.  The risk of not getting a better deal from Alice is increasing, while the price from John remains consistently at your maximum limit. It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
