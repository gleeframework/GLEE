"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  This is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to me and framing the offer as a ""great price"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open ended question:**  I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking Bob for his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob, even though he's already lowered his offer. 
* **Selling to John is an option:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John for $12,000 open as a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is reasonable:** $9,000 is a compromise, giving Bob a better price while still ensuring I receive a decent return.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a willingness to meet him halfway, making it seem more appealing than a hard-line stance. 
* **Open for further negotiation:**  I'm still using an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and potentially find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $7,250? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $7,250 is still well below my minimum value of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation room:**  While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, there's still space to negotiate a higher price.
* **Safeguard with John:**  I'm holding onto the option of selling to John for $12,000,  which is a much better deal for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,250 is still too far below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (again):** I'm framing my offer as a compromise, meeting him halfway between our previous offers. This keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement.
* **Significant discount:** I'm emphasizing the ""significant discount"" from my initial offer to show I'm being flexible and making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we ""close this deal"", encouraging Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. How about $8,000? I think that's a fair price, and it's getting close to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** $8,000 is finally meeting my minimum value for the product. 
* **Closing the deal:** It's getting late in the negotiation, and continuing to reject offers might risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether.
* **Time is a factor:**  With only 4 rounds left, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids potentially losing more money by trying to squeeze out a higher price."
