"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  I think it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more than that to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's a better price than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $9,000, he's getting the product for a price lower than John's and significantly lower than his initial price point.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth the potential savings."
