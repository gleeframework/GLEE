# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to work with you. How about $1,300,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to your maximum budget but still above it. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you have more rounds and could potentially get the price down to your target of $1,200,000."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,250,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

```

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your target of $1,200,000. With more rounds to go, it's worth pushing for a price closer to your budget. You could risk losing the deal, but the potential savings are significant."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I value your offer, $1,275,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's closer to a price that works for both of us. Let's find a solution that benefits both sides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While you could continue negotiating, there are only a few rounds left, and the risk of not reaching a deal is high. It's more prudent to purchase the product from John for $1,200,000 and guarantee the acquisition at a price that works for you."
