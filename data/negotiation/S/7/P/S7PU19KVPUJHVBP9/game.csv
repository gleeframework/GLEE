"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $12,000. This gives you a significant discount and allows me to get a fair price. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,
