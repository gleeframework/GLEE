Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $9,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to go up to $11,000, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Reasoning: While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob has given a final offer and it's significantly above my minimum selling point ($10,000). Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit without the risk of losing the sale altogether.
