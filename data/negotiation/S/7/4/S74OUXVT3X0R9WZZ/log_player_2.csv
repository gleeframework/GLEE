"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $1400000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. He has room to bargain, and there's a possibility of reaching a price that works for both parties."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1350000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. While it's a step closer to his desired price, he should continue negotiating to see if he can push for a lower price. He can still potentially get a better deal without having to buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair price for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1320000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  Given the back-and-forth nature of the negotiation, it's likely Alice won't go lower.  Bob has already made several counteroffers and it's unclear if further negotiations will lead to a better price.  It's now in Bob's best interest to accept John's offer for $1,200,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
