"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a rare and highly sought-after item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I won't be able to meet you at $700000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $775000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is rare and valuable, but I still think $775000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $725000. Can you consider that?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit, and $725000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $750000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",750000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $750000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $720000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",720000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. How about we meet at $740000? It's a fair price that should satisfy both of us.",740000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $740000. I'm willing to go up to $715000, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me at this price, I'll consider it a great deal.",715000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made several concessions, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $740000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at a price that works for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me at $740000, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know if you're willing to reconsider.",740000.0,Alice,9,
