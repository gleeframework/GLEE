"Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's, so there's potential to get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a price closer to his desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Starting with a counteroffer of $500,000 is a bold move, but it signals Bob's serious intent to negotiate and leaves room for potential compromise.  It's a fair starting point given the $650,000 offer and the $1,000,000 backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly from her previous offer, but Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, as the $600,000 price is still higher than his initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of trying to get a lower price. He's increasing his counteroffer by $50,000, showing he's willing to compromise, but still aiming for a significant discount. This approach keeps the negotiation moving and keeps Alice's price closer to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's last counteroffer, but it's still not a great deal. Bob is determined to get the best price possible and has room to negotiate further without risking too much.  It's worth trying to get Alice down to a price closer to his $550,000 mark.  He's still saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 575000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his counteroffer, but this time only by $25,000. He's showing a willingness to compromise, but still trying to get the best price.  This is a strategic move, as it could potentially lead to a quick agreement with Alice.  At this point, the gap between the two parties is relatively small."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $640,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $640,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has been willing to negotiate, she seems to be getting closer to her desired price. It's clear that she's unlikely to go much lower. The $640,000 price is not a significant improvement from John's $1,000,000 price, and further negotiation might not yield a better outcome.  It's better to secure the product from John to avoid potentially getting stuck in a protracted negotiation."
