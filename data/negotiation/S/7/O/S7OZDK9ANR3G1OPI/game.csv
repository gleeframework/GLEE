"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $17,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",17500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to negotiate, but $17,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $19,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers at $18,250.  Let's make this deal happen.",18250.0,Bob,4,
