Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  $1,500,000 (This is the minimum you'll accept).
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **John's Value:** $1,500,000 (Your guaranteed fallback option)

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your reservation price.  This allows you to aim high with Bob. However, you need to propose a price that's enticing enough for Bob to accept, knowing he values the product less than you do.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential returns."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** We start significantly above Bob's perceived value but below your guaranteed sale price.
* **Justification:** Vaguely mentioning ""unique value"" and ""potential returns"" attempts to frame the price in a positive light without revealing specific details.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves space for some negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, potentially landing somewhere between his $1,200,000 valuation and your $1,350,000 ask. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (but still above his $1,200,000 valuation).
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a smaller margin.
