"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love! I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($135 < $150).**
* **You save money compared to buying from John ($150 - $135 = $15).** 

Even though the product is only worth $120 to Alice, it's still a good deal for you since it's less than your maximum price and you get to save some money."
