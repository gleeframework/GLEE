"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it's a good item, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $15,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle, but $15,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we settle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $14,500. This is the best price I can offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
