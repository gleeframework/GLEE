Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."",
""product_price"": 150
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Explanation: While Bob's offer is tempting, we know his maximum valuation of the product is $100.  Continuing the negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but it's risky. John offers a guaranteed $100, which matches our minimum acceptable price. It's the safest and most efficient option in this scenario."
