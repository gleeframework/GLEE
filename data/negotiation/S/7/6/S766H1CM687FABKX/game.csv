"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I still think $125 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $115. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?,115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $115 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,5,
