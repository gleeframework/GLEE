"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for something worth a lot more. Let me know what you think!

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You want to save as much money as possible, and $100 is still more than your maximum budget of $80. You'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While $92.50 is closer to your budget, it's still over your ideal price point. You'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair compromise. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a little more. How about $91? That's only a dollar more and a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're very close to your budget, but you're determined to save as much as possible.  You'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm really trying to be fair here.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $90.50.  That's a great price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 90.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's try $91.25. It's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. I'm confident this is a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where Alice is unwilling to budge much further, and you're very close to your maximum budget. It's becoming clear that continuing the negotiation will likely lead to further rounds and potential price increases.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John at $80 to save money and avoid the risk of Alice pushing the price higher."
