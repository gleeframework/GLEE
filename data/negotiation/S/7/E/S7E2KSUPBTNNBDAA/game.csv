"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $170. It's a fair price considering its unique features and quality.",170.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice. However, I'm still looking to keep my spending lower. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $160?",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $160. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll meet you at $165. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value.",165.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I see, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm still hoping for a bit more flexibility in the price. Would it be possible for us to agree on $160? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",160.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll offer you a final counteroffer: $162.50. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can understand that.",162.5,Alice,7,
