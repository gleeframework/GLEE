# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This is a great price, considering the product is worth $8,000 to you. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. You have a strong alternative with John, so there's room to negotiate a better price with Alice."
