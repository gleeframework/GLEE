"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is still a bit outside your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,320,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me.",1320000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $1,320,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $1,275,000.  Let's see if we can seal the deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
