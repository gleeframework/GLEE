# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you.

Bob should choose to buy from John. 

Even though Alice is coming down in price, she's still not at his budget, and he's already gotten a better deal from John. There's no reason to continue negotiations with Alice as he's already reached a better outcome."
