"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1000000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it reflects the fair market value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a significant offer, but I'm still not sure it's enough to meet my expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is my best and final offer for now.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $900000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",980000.0,Alice,5,
