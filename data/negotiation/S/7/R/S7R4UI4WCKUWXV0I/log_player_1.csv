Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes some risk. If Bob rejects the offer, we settle for our guaranteed $1,200,000. However, the potential for exceeding that amount by securing a deal with Bob makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
