{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's a fair price considering the value to you, and it still gives me a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still trying to save as much as possible.  Rejecting and counteroffering again keeps you in the negotiation, potentially getting a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $110.  I'm willing to go to $105.  This is a good deal for both of us, let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 105}
