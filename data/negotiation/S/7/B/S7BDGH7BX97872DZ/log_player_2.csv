"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price. Alice values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us moving forward. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price.**  The price is now $13,500, which is only $500 more than Bob's initial counteroffer. 
* **It's a good deal compared to buying from John.**  The price from John is $15,000, which is significantly higher.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation, but it may not be worth it.**  While Bob could try for a lower price, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept.  The risk of further negotiation might not be worth the potential savings of $500."
