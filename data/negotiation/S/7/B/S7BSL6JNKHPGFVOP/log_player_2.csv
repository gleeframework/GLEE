It's always beneficial to try to negotiate further.  $900,000 is a significant discount from John's price, so there's room to potentially get a better deal."

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.  We'll see how she responds."
