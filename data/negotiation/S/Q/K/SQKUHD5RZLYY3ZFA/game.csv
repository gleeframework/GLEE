"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,500?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $10,500 is the best deal for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,6,
