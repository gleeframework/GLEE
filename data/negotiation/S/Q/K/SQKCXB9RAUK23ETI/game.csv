I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $1300000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a product that's worth $1500000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a great value.,1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're presenting, I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point to ensure it fits within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value to you is $1500000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1350000 is still a bit higher than what I can realistically afford right now. I'm prepared to pay $1275000, which is closer to my budget and a fair compromise. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I still need to get a price that's closer to the product's value to me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get at least $1300000 for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1290000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product is $1500000.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
