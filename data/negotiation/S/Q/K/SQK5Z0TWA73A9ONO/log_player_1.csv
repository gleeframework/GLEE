Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get as much as possible. Since Bob is interested, I'm giving him a chance to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll see if I can get closer to my minimum price point, or I can switch to John and guarantee myself $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise, offering a price that's higher than Bob's offer but still below my initial asking price. Hopefully, we can find a middle ground. If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, $9,500 is close enough to my minimum and I'm not sure I can get much more from Bob. It's also a better deal than selling to John, as I would get an extra $500."
