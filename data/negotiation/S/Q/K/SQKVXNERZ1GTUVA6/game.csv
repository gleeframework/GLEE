Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $105? That would be a fair price for both of us.,105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $130? It's a fair price that still benefits both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $115. This would be a great deal for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $125. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
