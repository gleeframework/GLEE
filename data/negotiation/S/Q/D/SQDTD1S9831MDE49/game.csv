"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is a unique product, and I'm confident it's worth every penny.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $1,000,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
