"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm afraid $800,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
