"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $11000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $9500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle!",10500.0,Alice,3,
