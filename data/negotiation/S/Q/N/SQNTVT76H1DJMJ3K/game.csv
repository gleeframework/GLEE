"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of our premium product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $11,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
