Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $11,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer.  While I could try to negotiate further,  the difference between $11,200 and my ideal price is small enough that it's worth securing the deal now."
