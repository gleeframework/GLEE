{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the potential value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value it brings to your business.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $11,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not there.  I can offer you $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business. Let's aim for a final agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target:**  The offer of $11,250 is only $250 higher than your last counteroffer of $11,000.
* **Limited room for further negotiation:** Alice has stated that this is her lowest price, meaning further negotiation might be futile.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  You're nearing the halfway point of the rounds.  Rejecting this offer risks losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price.

**Conclusion:**  It's time to accept the offer and secure the product. While you might be able to squeeze out an extra couple of hundred dollars, the risk of a failed negotiation and a higher price from John outweighs the potential savings."
