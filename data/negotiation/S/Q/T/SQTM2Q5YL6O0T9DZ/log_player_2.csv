"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a great return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent deal, Bob can likely get a better price. He has a significant buffer ($200,000) before having to resort to John's offer. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. I understand it's a valuable product, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  Bob is starting with a lower offer, aiming to find a middle ground.
* **Emphasizes mutual benefit:**  He frames his counteroffer as a win-win scenario for both of them. 
* **Sets the stage for negotiation:**  He's open to further discussion, suggesting he's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction:** She's lowered her price from $1,000,000 to $950,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still room for negotiation:**  Bob has a significant buffer ($250,000) before needing to buy from John. There's likely room for Alice to come down further.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pressing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. How about $900,000? That's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make it work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  Bob is offering a price that's exactly halfway between his previous offer ($850,000) and Alice's current offer ($950,000).
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  He emphasizes compromise and finding a solution that works for both parties.
* **Still leaves room for further negotiation:**  While $900,000 is a good deal for Bob, he can still afford to go a little higher if necessary."
