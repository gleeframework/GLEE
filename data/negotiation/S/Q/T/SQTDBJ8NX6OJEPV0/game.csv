"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,
