# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though Alice claims it's a great deal, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He can get the same product from John for a lower price, saving himself $200,000."
