**Reasoning:**

* The negotiation has reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the risks. 
*  I've already shown flexibility and tried to meet Bob in the middle, but he hasn't budged significantly.
* Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob in the remaining rounds.

**Conclusion:** 

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to secure a guaranteed profit and minimize risk."
