"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I understand your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,000?  This price still offers you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. How about we meet at $8,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you on the budget, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit further apart. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm still thinking $8,750 is a fair price for me. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about we settle on $9,250? This would give us both a good deal and close this negotiation. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to lose patience. I've been willing to negotiate and meet you halfway, but $9,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't agree on a price. I'll give you one last chance: $8,000 or I'll have to look elsewhere.",8000.0,Bob,8,
