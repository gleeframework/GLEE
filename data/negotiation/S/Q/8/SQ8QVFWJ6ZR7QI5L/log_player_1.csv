Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it is still below my minimum price. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
