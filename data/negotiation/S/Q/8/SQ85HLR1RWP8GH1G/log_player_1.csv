Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $175. I think you'll find it's worth it!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $150. 
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Offering it at $175 allows for a $25 profit if Bob accepts.
* **Not Being Greedy:** While a higher price is tempting, it significantly increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. $175 feels like a reasonable markup that Bob might be willing to pay.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no risk of being left with the product."
