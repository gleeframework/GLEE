"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $17,000. This is a strong opening offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a little more than the minimum he's willing to, but I'm also prepared to potentially lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get a little closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering $16,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I hope Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,200 is only slightly higher than what I'd get from John, and it's getting close to my minimum price. It's not ideal, but I'd rather take the $200 extra than risk going through more rounds of negotiations."
