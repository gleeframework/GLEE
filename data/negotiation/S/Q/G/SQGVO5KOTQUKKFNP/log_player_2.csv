"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still a significant amount over your ideal price point. There's room to negotiate further. By rejecting, you can try to push the price lower and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer at $1,200,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. The goal is to start the negotiation process with a clear signal that I'm serious about getting a lower price.  We'll see if she's willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's still a bit higher than my ideal price, but it's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to what I'm willing to pay.  Going back and forth with more counteroffers risks getting stuck in a stalemate, and John's offer is still a much less desirable option."
