"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend less than $1,000,000.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our original offer, so I'm counteroffering $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $1,025,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, and I'm willing to consider your latest offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
