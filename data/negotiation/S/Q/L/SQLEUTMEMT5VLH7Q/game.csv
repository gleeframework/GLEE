"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're presenting, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $800000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price.  I'm willing to go up to $850000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
