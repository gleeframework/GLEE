You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate further. You can potentially save more money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  While you might not get the product for less than $950,000, there's a chance Alice will be willing to go lower to close the deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  Accepting her offer at $925,000 saves you $75,000 compared to buying from John. The risk of further negotiation is that Alice could reject your counteroffer and you might end up paying more."
