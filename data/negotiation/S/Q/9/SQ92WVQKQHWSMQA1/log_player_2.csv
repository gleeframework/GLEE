"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. This is a fantastic deal, as the value of this product is much higher. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'll choose to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $150 to Alice, but I'm looking to save as much money as I can, and $135 is still $15 more than I'm willing to pay. I'll look elsewhere.
