"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My starting offer is $1,250,000.  Let's discuss."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1250000 is a bit steep for me. Given my assessment, I'm willing to pay $1050000. This price reflects the value I place on the product, while still allowing for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can still secure a better deal with Bob or, if necessary, move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential partnership, $1,050,000 is simply not a price I can accept.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the unique value of this product to you, and I believe it allows for a fair and profitable deal for both of us. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1150000 is still above my budget. I believe $1100000 is a fair compromise, reflecting the unique value of the product to me while allowing for a healthy profit for you. Let's find a middle ground and seal this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's a good deal, and we've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation. Accepting this offer secures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
