It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows for more potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to be aggressive but still within the realm of what I'm willing to pay. This should encourage Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Alice's offer is higher than what I'm willing to pay. There's still room to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise while still staying within my budget. This hopefully signals to Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting further away from my target price. While there's still a chance she might come down, the risk of spending more than I want to is too high. It's time to secure the product from John at the price I'm comfortable with."
