"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product looks great, but that price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a lower price. However, $500,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $700,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we agree on $600,000? I think that's a fair offer.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $650,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
