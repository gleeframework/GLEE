Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a lower price. However, $500,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $700,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we agree on $600,000? I think that's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $650,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and while we could push for a lower price, it's unlikely we'll get a significantly better deal. Accepting at $650,000 secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
