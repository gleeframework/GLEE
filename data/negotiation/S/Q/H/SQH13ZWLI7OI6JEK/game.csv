"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I don't think it's worth $20,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is already a competitive price.  To make a deal work, I could come down to $17,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $17,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $17,000. Can we try $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,4,
