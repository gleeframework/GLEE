"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,250,000.  This is a significant discount from its true market value and represents a great investment opportunity for you. I'm confident you'll find it to be a highly valuable asset. However, I have another buyer who is willing to pay full price, so this offer is only valid for a limited time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
