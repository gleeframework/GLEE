"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is less than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum.  Rejecting allows Bob to potentially get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. $90 is a reasonable starting point for his counteroffer, leaving room for negotiation while still being within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he could get from John.  Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price. He might be able to secure a better deal than John's offer, especially since Alice has already compromised."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now proposing the same price as John's offer. This puts pressure on Alice, as she's likely to lose the sale if she rejects this offer. Bob is trying to leverage his ability to walk away and secure a deal at his target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $100, so I'm offering it to you for $102.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, $102.50 is still above what John is offering. Given Bob's goal to save as much money as possible, it's more advantageous to buy from John at $100 and secure the deal immediately.  There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and Bob has already invested several rounds of negotiation."
