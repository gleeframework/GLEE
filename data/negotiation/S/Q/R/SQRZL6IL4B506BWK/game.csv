"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $8200 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised a bit with my previous offer. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm counteroffering at $9500 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 6-month warranty and dedicated support. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
