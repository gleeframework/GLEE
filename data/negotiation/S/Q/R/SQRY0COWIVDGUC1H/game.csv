"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? It's still a great price for a product worth that much to you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. ",8000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your asking price, so I'm offering $7,750. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7750.0,Bob,4,
