"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to get it for closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. Would you be willing to go up to $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm willing to consider your latest offer, Bob, but I need to think about it. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $10,750. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,250. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,,
