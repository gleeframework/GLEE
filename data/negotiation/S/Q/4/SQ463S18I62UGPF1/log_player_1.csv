"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $10,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer as the product is worth $12,000 to him. However, if he rejects, I'm prepared to counter-offer and use the remaining rounds to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer.  While it's above my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm confident I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a fair price considering the value of the product to him. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's likely closer to his perceived value. If he rejects again, I'll continue to negotiate strategically, keeping in mind the value to John as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds, so I need to be strategic.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,900. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it's a strategic move.  It signals to Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal but also that I'm not willing to go too much lower.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to consider John's offer, but I'm still hopeful we can reach a deal with Bob."
