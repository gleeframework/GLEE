"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product. We're excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $900,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you. However, we're not willing to go as low as $750,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. We believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is fair considering the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close, but we're not quite there yet. We're willing to make one more concession. We'll offer the product for $815,000. This is as low as we're willing to go, and we believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've successfully negotiated the price down from $900,000 to $815,000.  You're within your desired price range and have saved a significant amount of money.  While you could continue negotiating, you're getting close to Alice's minimum price, so it's likely that further negotiations will take longer and may not lead to a much better outcome."
