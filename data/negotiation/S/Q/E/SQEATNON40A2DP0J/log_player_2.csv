Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,800,000 represents the high end of the product's value,  $1,000,000 undervalues it significantly.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
