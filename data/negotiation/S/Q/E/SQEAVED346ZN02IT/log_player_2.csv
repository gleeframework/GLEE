"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its features and potential.  To make this a win-win, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,000 is too high for Bob, as he is willing to pay a maximum of $12,000. 
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible, and $9,500 is a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Strategy:** A counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer shows Bob's serious intent to negotiate. 
* **Counteroffer Logic:** This offer is still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($8,000) but gives her room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $10,250 is still too high for Bob.
* **Strategy:** Rejecting the offer again allows Bob to continue negotiating a lower price.  He can try to get closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is still a bit above what I can comfortably offer.  How about $9,800?  It's a fair compromise closer to our respective positions."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Get the product for as close to $9,500 as possible.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, showing flexibility. It's also closer to Alice's last offer, aiming to signal a potential agreement.
* **Counteroffer Logic:**  This price is still higher than what the product is worth to Alice, but lower than Alice's previous offer, indicating a willingness to reach a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,800 is getting closer, but I need to be closer to $10,000 to make this work. Would you consider $9,950? It's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** $9,950 is close to Bob's desired price point of $9,500 and is within his budget of $12,000.
* **Strategy:** Accepting this offer is a good compromise that secures the product at a price Bob can afford, minimizing potential further negotiation. 
* **Risk Assessment:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and him potentially having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings from a slight price reduction."
