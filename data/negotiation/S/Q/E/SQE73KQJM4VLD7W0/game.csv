Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think?,20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you the product for $12000. This is a good compromise between your budget and my asking price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $9000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial asking price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit high.  I'm going to have to stick with my offer of $9000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $9000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm going to stick with my offer of $9000.  I truly believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $9000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,9,
