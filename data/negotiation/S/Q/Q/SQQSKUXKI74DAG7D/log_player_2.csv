Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice is moving closer to my desired price, but I'm still aiming for a better deal. I'll hold out a bit longer and see if I can get it closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, Bob. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a reasonable price, and Alice has stated it's her final offer.  It's unlikely I'll get a better deal, and I don't want to risk losing the product."
