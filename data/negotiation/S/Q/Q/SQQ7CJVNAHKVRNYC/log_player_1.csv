"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and using language like ""great deal"" to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open ended question:**  The question ""Let me know your thoughts!"" invites Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even my initial offer of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob is interested in the product, and his counteroffer indicates a willingness to negotiate. This makes further rounds worthwhile.
* **Strategic advantage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and can potentially secure a higher price in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value, subtly implying that $10,500 is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive framing:**  I use language like ""fair compromise"" and ""happy to work with you"" to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $9,800 is still below my $15,000 threshold.
* **Negotiation room:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate. There's still room to push for a higher price.
* **Strategic advantage:** I want to avoid selling for a loss. By rejecting this offer, I maintain leverage and can explore better options in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  While $9,800 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,200. This is a significant compromise from my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still keeping the price above my minimum.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the product's value to remind Bob that $10,200 is still a fair deal.
* **Open-ended question:** The question ""What do you think?"" keeps the conversation going and allows Bob to respond.
* **Positive framing:** I use language like ""serious about getting this product"" and ""significant compromise"" to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I'm really close to walking away, but I still think this product could be a great fit for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too low:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While he claims he's ""really close to walking away,"" his actions suggest he's willing to keep bargaining lower.
* **Time is running out:** We're already at round 6, and I've already made several concessions. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price and a longer process. 
* **Guaranteed sale:**  John is offering a price that meets my minimum, guaranteeing a successful sale and ending the negotiation. It's a safer and more financially advantageous choice."
