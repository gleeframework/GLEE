"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a good compromise for both of us.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  While $9,800 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,200. This is a significant compromise from my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I'm really close to walking away, but I still think this product could be a great fit for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer.",9500.0,Bob,6,
