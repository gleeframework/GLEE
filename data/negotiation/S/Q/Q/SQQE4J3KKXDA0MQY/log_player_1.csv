**Reasoning:** 

While Bob has increased his offer, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  His increases are also getting smaller, suggesting he's reaching his limit. It's unlikely he'll reach $10,000.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to take John's guaranteed offer and avoid wasting further time."
