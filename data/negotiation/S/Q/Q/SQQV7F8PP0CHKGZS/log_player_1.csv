Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I know you're interested in. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, offering it slightly below that at $14,000 maximizes Alice's potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $14,000, there might be a small window for Bob to negotiate down slightly, still landing Alice above her minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering it too high (close to $15,000) risks Bob rejecting the offer and going with another option, forcing Alice to sell to John for $10,000."
