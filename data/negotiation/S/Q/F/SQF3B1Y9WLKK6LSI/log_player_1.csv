Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider this price?

Round 6

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is clearly interested. While his offer is getting closer to the $1,100,000 mark, we have room to push for a better price. It's too early to settle, and selling to John would mean leaving a significant amount of money on the table."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position on the budget. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,160,000? This is a significant investment for both of us, and I believe it reflects a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1160000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining a firm stance:** While we are moving closer to Bob's price range, we want to reiterate that we value the product highly.
* **Finding a middle ground:** We are making a smaller concession this round ($30,000 instead of $40,000 or $50,000) to signal that we are nearing our bottom line.
* **Positive framing:**  We're highlighting the mutually beneficial aspect of the deal to keep the tone collaborative."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,080,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time constraint:** We are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Waiting longer increases the risk of Bob walking away or offering even less.
* **Diminishing returns:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively for small gains might sour the deal.  A $1,080,000 sale is still a very significant profit.
* **Opportunity cost:** While we could hold out for more from Bob, there's always a chance he won't budge. Accepting now guarantees a substantial return, whereas continuing carries risk. 

While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more from Bob, accepting at $1,080,000 ensures a successful and profitable outcome at this stage."
