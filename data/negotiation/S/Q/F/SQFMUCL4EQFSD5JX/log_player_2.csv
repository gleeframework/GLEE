You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his maximum budget.  He should proceed with a counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

```

Bob is starting with a very low counteroffer, hoping to get a negotiation going. It's highly unlikely Alice will accept this price, but it establishes a starting point and signals Bob's serious intent to buy, but at a much lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. While it's closer to his maximum budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate further to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Bob is raising his offer, but still significantly below Alice's price. He's trying to find a middle ground that both parties might be willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his maximum budget, it's still a little higher than he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate further and see if he can get Alice to come down to a price closer to his ideal. He can also consider buying from John as an option, but it's best to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Bob is making a final counteroffer, close to his maximum budget but still lower than Alice's offer. It's a calculated risk, but he's hoping Alice will accept to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is only $50,000 less than John's price, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept any further counteroffers.  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice when John is offering a price that is within Bob's budget."
