"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's fair for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. My counteroffer is $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,225,000. This is the closest I can get to your offer while still meeting my minimum requirements.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $1,225,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
