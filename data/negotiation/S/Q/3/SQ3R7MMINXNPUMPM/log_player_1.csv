Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so I won't go lower than that. 
* **Potential for more:** I'm aiming for a higher price, hoping Bob values the product more than $1,000,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Bob will reject, but I'm willing to take that chance for the potential of a higher profit. If he rejects, I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. 

This offer is a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring I don't lose out on a sale."
