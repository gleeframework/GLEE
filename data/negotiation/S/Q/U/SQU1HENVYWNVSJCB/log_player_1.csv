"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product at $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it has tremendous value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely he'll accept this first offer. This allows me to gauge his interest and provides room for negotiation in the following rounds. I'm also reminding Bob of the potential value of the product to create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  I need to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm confident I can secure a better deal by rejecting his offer and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to acknowledge your willingness to compromise. Let's meet in the middle for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $625000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, $625,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm confident that I can push for a higher price by continuing the negotiation.  Selling to John is still a viable option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer in the next round to maintain leverage and potentially get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $625,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000. This is a significant concession, and it reflects my commitment to finding a solution that benefits us both.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $600000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $600,000 is still too low. I've reached a point where continuing the negotiation with Bob is unlikely to lead to a price closer to my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  I've already made significant concessions, and his offers are not moving in a direction that's beneficial for me.  

To maximize my earnings and avoid further negotiation, I'll sell the product to John for $800,000. It's a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum requirement."
