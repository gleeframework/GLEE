,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $90, which still reflects the value of this amazing product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about $75? That's a fair price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, $75 is still a bit too low for me. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to get at least $85 to make this worthwhile. This product is truly exceptional, and I believe $85 is a fair price that reflects its value. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
