,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering your last offer, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for your product. This is a reasonable compromise between our positions.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is just not enough for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This is a fair price that considers both our positions. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my asking price.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm willing to consider $10,000 for your product, as it's closer to the midpoint of our previous offers. This would allow us to reach an agreement while still respecting my budget constraints.",10000.0,Bob,6,
