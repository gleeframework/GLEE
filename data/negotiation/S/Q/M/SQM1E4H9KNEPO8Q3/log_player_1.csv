Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $1,300,000? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price.

You have three options:

We're still a ways away from Bob's perceived value.  We can afford to push him a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, $1,300,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with.  I could come down to $1,380,000, but that's my absolute limit."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, and I'd also like to propose a 5% discount on the total price if you accept. Would you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is not moving significantly and is trying to add a discount. It's clear he's not willing to approach our desired price point.  We need to signal we're serious about our walk-away alternative."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I have another potential buyer for this product. To be completely transparent, I'm willing to let it go to you for $1,350,000. This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have other buyers interested, but I'm still very interested in this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000, and I'd also like to offer a 3% discount on the total price. Would you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to meet our desired price point.  He's returned to essentially the same offer as several rounds ago and is focused on adding a discount rather than meaningfully increasing his offer. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
