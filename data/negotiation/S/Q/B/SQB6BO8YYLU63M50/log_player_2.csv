# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth the same to you and Alice, there's no advantage to buying from her. You can get the same product from John for the same price. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to save money."
