"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay right now.  Would you be willing to consider $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is still a bit low for me. How about $135? I think that's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",135.0,Alice,3,
