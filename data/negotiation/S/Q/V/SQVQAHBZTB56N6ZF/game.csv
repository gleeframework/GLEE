"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. ",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate but $19,000 is still outside my price range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $12,000. This is a fair price, given my budget constraints.  I'm hoping we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $12,000. My final offer is $16,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  I have another buyer interested at a higher price, but I'm hoping we can close this deal today.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your situation, but $16,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is my final offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, given our respective positions.  If you're serious about selling today, this is our best chance to reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,6,
