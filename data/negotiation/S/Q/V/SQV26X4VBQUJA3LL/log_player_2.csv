"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  He's willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. He's offering a price that's still more than his maximum, but leaves room for Alice to counter if she's not comfortable with that price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I can get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $10,000 limit. While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $11,500 is still higher than Bob's target. He should continue negotiating, hoping to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price but is still trying to secure a better deal.  He's increasing his offer slightly from the previous round to show his willingness to negotiate but remaining firm in his desire to get a price closer to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for $11,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is still above Bob's target of $10,000.  While there's still room for negotiation, Bob has already made several counteroffers and the price isn't dropping significantly. He's reached a point where it's more advantageous to buy from John, ensuring he gets the product at his maximum price point. Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether."
