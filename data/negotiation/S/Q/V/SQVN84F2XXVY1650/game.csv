"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a great deal for you as well.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm going to have to counter at $1,300,000. That's still a great deal for you, and it fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
