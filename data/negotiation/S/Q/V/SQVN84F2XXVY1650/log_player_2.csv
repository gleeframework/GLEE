"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a great deal for you as well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a better price. You have room to negotiate, and rejecting the offer allows you to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm going to have to counter at $1,300,000. That's still a great deal for you, and it fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within your budget, and you've already negotiated down from her initial asking price. Accepting this offer means you get the product without further negotiation and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer or you having to buy from John at a slightly higher price."
