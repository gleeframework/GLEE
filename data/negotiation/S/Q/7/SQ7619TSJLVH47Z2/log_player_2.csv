It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. $1,200,000 is above your maximum budget, and you can potentially get a better deal."

``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a bold move to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."

While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $950,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good price."

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my budget, I'm still willing to risk rejecting it to try and get a better deal. There's a chance that Alice is getting closer to her bottom line and might be willing to accept a counteroffer."

I'm going to meet Alice halfway at $1,000,000. This is my absolute maximum, but it's still a good deal compared to John's price.  If Alice accepts, I get the product at my budget limit. If not, I can go with John without any loss."

Alice is clearly not willing to budge on her price, and I'm not comfortable going higher than my initial offer of $1,000,000. It's time to move on and secure the product from John at my maximum budget."
