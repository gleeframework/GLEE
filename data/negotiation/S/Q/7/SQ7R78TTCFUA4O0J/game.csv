"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a premium price point of $22,000.  I think it will be incredibly valuable for you, even more so than my usual buyers.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $5,000.  What do you think?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter but $5,000 is far too low. This product is highly sought after and I have other buyers interested at a much higher price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $18,000 is still significantly more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I can tell you're serious.  While $7,000 is still too low, I'm willing to come down a bit more to $15,000. This is my absolute bottom line, as I have another buyer ready at this price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
