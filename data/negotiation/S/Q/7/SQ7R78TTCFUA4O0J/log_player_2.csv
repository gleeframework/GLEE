"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a premium price point of $22,000.  I think it will be incredibly valuable for you, even more so than my usual buyers.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter but $5,000 is far too low. This product is highly sought after and I have other buyers interested at a much higher price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I can tell you're serious.  While $7,000 is still too low, I'm willing to come down a bit more to $15,000. This is my absolute bottom line, as I have another buyer ready at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down to her minimum price ($15,000), which she states is her ""absolute bottom line.""  It's unlikely she'll go any lower. Since your maximum price is $8,000 and John is offering the product at that price, it's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and buy from John."
