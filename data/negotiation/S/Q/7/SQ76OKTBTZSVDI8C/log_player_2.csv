"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make me a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Since John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or, if that fails, buy from John at the same price."
