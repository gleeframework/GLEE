I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  He's clearly willing to pay more than $100, and I'm not yet at my minimum price."

I'm still trying to get as close to my desired price as possible while staying within the negotiation space and keeping Bob interested."

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer of $106.  While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, we're running out of rounds and I'm getting closer to the minimum price I'm willing to accept.  It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing it entirely."
