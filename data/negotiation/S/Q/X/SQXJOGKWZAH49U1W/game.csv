"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However,  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference -  how about $8,500?  That seems like a fair compromise.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $8,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I think we can close this out. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Alice,5,
