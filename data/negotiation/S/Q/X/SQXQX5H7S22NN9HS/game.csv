"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  How about $12,500?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,500? It's a good compromise, and still a great value for you.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,500.  Let's split the difference - how about $13,000? I think that's a fair price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
