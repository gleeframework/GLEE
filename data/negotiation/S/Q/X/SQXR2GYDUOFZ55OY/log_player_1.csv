Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll analyze Bob's response to understand his interest level and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of significantly compromising my profit.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $900,000, which is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal and a fair compromise.  Accepting this offer is a good way to finalize the sale and avoid further negotiation."
