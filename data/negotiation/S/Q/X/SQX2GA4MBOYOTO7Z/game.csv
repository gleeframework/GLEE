"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I believe this price reflects the value of the product for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $10,750 is better, I'm aiming for something around $10,250. Would that work for you?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $10,500. This gives you a good price, and it's closer to my asking price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
