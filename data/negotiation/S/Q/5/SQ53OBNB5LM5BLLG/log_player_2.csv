"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,600 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between his ideal price of $8,000 and Alice's initial offer of $9,600. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a significant discount.  By offering $8,500, Bob is signaling his willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price slightly, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob is likely to continue negotiating, as there's still room for both parties to find a mutually agreeable price. He might try another counteroffer or see if Alice is willing to go lower in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $8,800. This shows Alice that he's willing to negotiate but still wants a good deal.  It's a moderate increase from his previous offer, signaling a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,900 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, the negotiation is getting close, and there is a high chance that Alice will not lower the price significantly further. It's more beneficial for Bob to take the guaranteed price of $8,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice.  While there is still room to negotiate with Alice, the potential savings are small compared to the certainty of a deal with John."
