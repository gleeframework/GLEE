Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $105?  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $97.50 is still below what I can accept. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $101.25. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $100, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees the best price for your budget."
