# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial to you and I'm pleased to offer it to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is $1,450,000.
* **John's offer is the best option:** Since John is willing to sell for your maximum price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and go with John."
