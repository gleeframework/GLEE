Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $105. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $97 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has met your target price. There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and it's not worth risking missing out on the product altogether by continuing to negotiate."
