,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, however, I believe the true value of this product is closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the significant benefits you'll gain.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. My final offer is $1,125,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm not willing to go above $1,100,000. I'm making a final counteroffer at $1,100,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
