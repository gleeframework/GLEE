Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. This price reflects its worth to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.
