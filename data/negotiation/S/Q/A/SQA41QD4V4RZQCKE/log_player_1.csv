{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly greeting and builds rapport. It also highlights the value of the product, subtly emphasizing its worth to Bob while acknowledging your own minimum price point. This approach aims to get Bob interested while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's only $100, and I'm confident I can get more.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $115? It's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. Let's try to meet in the middle. How about $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get more, $108 is a fair compromise and significantly better than selling to John for $100.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
