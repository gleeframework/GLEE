"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand this is a significant investment, so I'm willing to give you a special price.  I'm asking for $1000000. This is a substantial discount from what I could potentially get elsewhere.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what Bob would pay John ($1,000,000 vs $1,500,000).  This represents a potential saving of $500,000, making it a very favorable deal for Bob.  While Bob doesn't know the true value of the product to Alice, the fact that she's offering a substantial discount implies it might not be as valuable to her as it could be to Bob.  

It's a good deal for Bob, and he should accept."
