**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal compared to John's offer of $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price, potentially saving some money."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?
