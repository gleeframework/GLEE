Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it also leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more, but if he counters with a lower offer, I can still make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price closer to the product's value. I'll counter with a higher offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob is unwilling to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. I've lowered my price from the initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, and I believe it reflects the product's true value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counter with a higher offer, but if Bob is not willing to meet me halfway, I'll sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This is my final counteroffer. It's a small concession from my previous offer but still allows me to earn a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price and accept the offer. If he rejects it, I will sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
