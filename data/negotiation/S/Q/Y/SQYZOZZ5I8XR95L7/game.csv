"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is quite a bit below my asking price.  Could you meet me halfway at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $10,000 is low, but $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $11,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",11500.0,Bob,4,
