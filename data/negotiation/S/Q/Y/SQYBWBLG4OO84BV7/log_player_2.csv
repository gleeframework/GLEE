(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where we've exhausted most of our negotiation options and Alice is showing no signs of budging significantly. We're now risking running out of rounds and being forced to accept a higher price than we'd like.  

Buying from John at $1,500,000 ensures we get the product within our budget, even though it's not the ideal price. It's a pragmatic decision to avoid further negotiation and potential risk."
