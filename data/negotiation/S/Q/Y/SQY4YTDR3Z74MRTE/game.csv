"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in lower than $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm going to counter with $1,080,000. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,080,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,065,000?  This would allow both of us to be satisfied with the deal.",1065000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,065,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm going to counter with $1,090,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get your target price, but $1,090,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,095,000. I'm willing to make one last push to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm going to counter with $1,085,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",1085000.0,Alice,7,
