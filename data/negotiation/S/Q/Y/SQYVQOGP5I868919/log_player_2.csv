"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price.  You know John will sell it for $120, so rejecting Alice's offer might push her to lower the price further."
