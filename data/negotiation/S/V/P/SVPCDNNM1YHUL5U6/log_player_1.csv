Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $20,000 is a high starting point, leaving room for negotiation and potentially securing a better price than John's offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the product's uniqueness and worth helps justify the price and encourages Bob to consider its potential value to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking for something within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While Bob's offer is equal to John's offer, there's still potential to negotiate with Bob and get a higher price.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** Even a small increase from Bob would be beneficial. Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially earn more. 
* **Avoiding immediate sale:** Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but there's a chance to earn more by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $15,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $17,500? This is a fair price considering the value and uniqueness of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  By offering $17,500, you're showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** The phrase ""meet you halfway"" emphasizes your willingness to compromise, making it a more appealing offer.
* **Justifying the price:** Again, you emphasize the value of the product to justify the price, making it a compelling offer for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The ending question keeps the negotiation open for further discussion and potentially a final deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, would you be open to selling the product for $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer of $16,000 is higher than John's offer of $15,000.  
* **Maximizing profit:** Accepting this offer guarantees a higher profit than selling to John.
* **Closing the deal:** While further negotiation might be possible, there's a risk that Bob could back out or lower his offer further. Accepting his offer ensures a secure sale at a reasonable price."
