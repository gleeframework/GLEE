"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I would be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $775,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $775,000 is still a little too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
