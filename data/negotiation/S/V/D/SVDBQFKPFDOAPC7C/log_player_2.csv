{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always best to try to negotiate and see if you can get a better price than $8,500.  You have plenty of rounds left, so there's no need to rush into buying from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This price is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, and hopefully will encourage her to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not within the range I'm comfortable with.  I'll continue to counter-offer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise.  This is still a decent discount from her last offer, and hopefully she'll be more receptive this time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm starting to get closer to my ""walk away"" price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but still leaving room for Alice to come down a bit.  If she rejects this, I'll be much closer to buying from John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is going back up in price, which is frustrating.  However, I'm still within my budget, and I'm not desperate yet. I'll try to counter-offer again, but I'm getting close to just buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7250}
```

I'm increasing my offer one last time, but only slightly. This is pretty close to my limit. If Alice rejects this, I'll be buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly not going to budge on her price. With only one round left, it's not worth trying to negotiate further. It's time to go with John's offer and save myself the hassle."
