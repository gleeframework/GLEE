Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to haggle you down a bit.
* **Not Too High:** While starting high, it's crucial to keep the price within a reasonable range. Asking for $250 would likely be rejected outright, as it's more than double what Bob values the product at.  
* **Justification:** A brief, non-specific statement about the product's value can encourage Bob to consider the offer more seriously. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still maintaining a good chance of Bob accepting the offer. If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always propose a lower price or simply sell to John for her minimum acceptable price."
