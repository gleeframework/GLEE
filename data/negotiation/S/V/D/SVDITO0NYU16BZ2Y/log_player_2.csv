Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900000 is unfortunately too low for me. The product's value is intrinsically tied to its potential, which I believe warrants a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $950000. It's a fair compromise that reflects both the value and your budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
