"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I know it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that's still very fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a figure that works for both of us.  I'm open to negotiation.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
