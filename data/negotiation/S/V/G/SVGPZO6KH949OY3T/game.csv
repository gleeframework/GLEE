"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $10,750? That's a good compromise, I think.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there with $10,750. Let's try $11,250. It's closer to your offer, and hopefully, we can finally reach an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
