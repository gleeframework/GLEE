"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I know you'll love. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, but I think we can do better than that. Can you meet me in the middle at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a strategic move.  While $8,750 is more than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. It's worth exploring if we can get closer to my desired price point by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding a compromise, $8,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $9,125? This would allow us both to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable with $9,125, and I think we can do better than that. I'm still willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While he's sticking to $8,500, I'm hoping that by continuing the negotiation, I can push him closer to my desired price point or at least get a better counteroffer in the next round. Selling to John for $10,000 is always an option, but it's still worth exploring if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price a bit further to $9,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  I think this shows I'm committed to making this deal work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go any higher. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer of $8,750 is better than his previous offers, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point.  I've already been negotiating for a few rounds, and it seems unlikely that I can push Bob to meet my price point. 

Since John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, it makes sense to sell to him to maximize my profit.  I've already wasted some time negotiating with Bob."
