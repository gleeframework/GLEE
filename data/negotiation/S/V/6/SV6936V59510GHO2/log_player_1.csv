Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It's unlikely he'll go as low as $12,000 (your minimum) knowing he gains $3,000 in value from the purchase.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 provides a safety net. This means you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
