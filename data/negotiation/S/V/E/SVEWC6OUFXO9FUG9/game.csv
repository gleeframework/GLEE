,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate. However, given the quality and features of the product, I believe $80 might not cover our costs. To accommodate you, I would like to offer the product at $95. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while providing you with a great value.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $87.50. Can you consider this price?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the value provided by our product, I am willing to offer it to you at $90. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that I'm not going to find a better deal anywhere else, but I'm still not willing to pay $90. I'll make one more offer: $85. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me at this price.",85.0,Bob,6,
