"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's make this deal happen!",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $750,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to offer $725,000 for the product. This would be a significant saving for me and still allows you to get a good price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",725000.0,Bob,4,
