"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my maximum budget. I hope we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $925000 is still a bit higher than I'm prepared to go at this time.  I'm willing to pay $875000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us and allows for a successful transaction.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
