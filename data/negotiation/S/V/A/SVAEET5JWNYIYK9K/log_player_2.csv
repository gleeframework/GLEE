"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting because it's below your maximum price. However, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's room for a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your ideal price, but it's closer to your counteroffer than her initial offer. There's still room for negotiation, and you can try to lower the price further.  Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is back to her original price of $900,000.**  This is a reasonable price, especially considering you've already rejected two of her offers.
* **Continuing to negotiate might result in a further stalemate.**  Alice is likely not willing to go lower than $900,000, and you might be stuck in a back-and-forth without reaching a deal. 
* **Buying from John would cost you $1,200,000.**  This is significantly more than Alice's current offer. 

**Conclusion:** It's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a price that's still within your budget and allows for a successful transaction."
