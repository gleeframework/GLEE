Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really find valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but still lower than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly and casual tone can help build rapport and make Bob more open to negotiating.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to see it as a worthwhile investment. 
* **Negotiation Flexibility:**  This offer leaves room for Bob to counter, allowing me to adjust my price accordingly.  
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's still above my value for the product. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** Rejecting and counteroffering creates uncertainty.  There's a chance Bob will walk away, leaving me with only the $80 offer from John. 
* **Profit Maximization:**  Accepting the offer guarantees a profit of $20, which is better than the $0 profit I would get if Bob walks away."
