{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but significantly lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a positive tone encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting at $1,250,000, there's room for Bob to make a counteroffer, and for me to potentially negotiate further without dropping below my minimum. 
* **John as a Backup:**  The knowledge that John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to take the $900,000, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I know John is a backup buyer, which gives me leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection with Justification:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but clearly state it's too low. 
* **Counter with Reason:** I provide a counteroffer that's a significant step down from my initial price, but still above Bob's offer. I emphasize the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:** I use language that suggests a willingness to reach an agreement, encouraging Bob to consider my offer. 

By maintaining a firm but diplomatic approach, I aim to continue the negotiation and reach a mutually acceptable price while staying above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000. I am willing to continue negotiating to see if I can reach a mutually acceptable price, but I won't settle for an offer that is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  

I have the safety net of John's offer at $1,500,000, which gives me confidence to hold firm and potentially counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  However, $950,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal; it's a great opportunity for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I acknowledge Bob's increased offer, showing that I'm engaging in the negotiation. 
* **Compromise with Justification:** I counter with a price that's a further step down from my previous offer but still above Bob's, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Positive and Urgency:** I use language that suggests a willingness to reach an agreement, and I introduce a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually acceptable price while ensuring I don't settle for a price too far below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we've gotten closer, it seems like we're at an impasse.  It's becoming clear that we're not going to agree on a price that works for both of us.  

Rather than continue to negotiate with Bob and risk wasting more time, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees me my minimum desired price and ensures I don't lose out on a valuable opportunity."
