Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000, which is $11,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll go below $11,000. Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal and avoid further negotiation."
