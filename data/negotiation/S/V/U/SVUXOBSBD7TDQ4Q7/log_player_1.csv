"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. While I'd prefer to earn more, accepting his offer ensures I don't lose out on the deal and get my desired value. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
