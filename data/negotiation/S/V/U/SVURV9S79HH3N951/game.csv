"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
