"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget.  It's always better to try and negotiate with Alice, hoping she'll lower the price. If negotiations fail, you can always resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still within a reasonable range for a negotiation.  This initial counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if necessary while also demonstrating your seriousness about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at your maximum budget. Buying from Alice at this price is equivalent to buying from John.  There's no benefit to further negotiating, as you could potentially end up paying more or spending more time in the negotiation process."
