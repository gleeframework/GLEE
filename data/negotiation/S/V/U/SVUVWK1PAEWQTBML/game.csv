"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product but $8500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9500?  That leaves some room for negotiation and is still a fair price for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $9000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9000. I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $9250? That's a small step for me, and it would be a good deal for you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go up to $9250. I think $8800 is a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at that price?,8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're set on $8800, but I'm really hoping to get at least $9000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $8900?  This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find this a good deal.",8900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but $8900 is still a bit high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8700. Can you consider that?",8700.0,Bob,8,
