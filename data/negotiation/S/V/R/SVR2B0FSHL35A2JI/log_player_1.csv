Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I know you're interested in. I'm willing to sell it for $140.  It's a fantastic price and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value of $150 without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes that this is a ""great deal"" to entice Bob.

By offering a price of $140, we increase our chances of:

1. **Bob Accepting:** He gets the product for less than his perceived value.
2. **Maximizing Profit:**  We earn $20 more than selling to our backup buyer, John."
