Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer on it, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.

While Bob is getting closer to my acceptable range, it's not worth the risk of him dropping out entirely. I'll take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
