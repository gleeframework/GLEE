{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It gives you room to make concessions if needed.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows confidence and sets a clear expectation. 

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if I want to accept or make a counteroffer of my own. If I can't reach a deal, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $10,000 for it. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is far below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $11,500 for this product.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am still interested in purchasing your product. I would like to propose a price of $11,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and Bob has stated this is his final offer. It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing the deal and potentially having to sell to John for less."
