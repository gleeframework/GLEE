Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is truly significant. I could come down to $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a touch higher than I'd like to go. How about $1,100,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $1,100,000 is a strong profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further negotiation rounds driving the price down."
