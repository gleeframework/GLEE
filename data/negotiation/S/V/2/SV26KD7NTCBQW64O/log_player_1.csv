"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product for $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I am willing to go lower than my initial offer but not that low. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $700,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $850,000? This price still allows for a substantial profit for you, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $775,000 is the maximum I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to accept. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe the product's worth more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's try $825,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to get what we want.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from comfortable with $825,000. Can we try $790,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had several rounds of negotiations with Bob and we're not getting close to my desired price. While $790,000 is getting closer, it's still not enough.  I've reached a point where it's more beneficial to sell to John for $800,000. It's a guarantee, and I'm not confident we'll reach a deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
