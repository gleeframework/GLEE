"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $700,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $850,000? This price still allows for a substantial profit for you, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $775,000 is the maximum I can go. Can you consider that?",775000.0,Bob,4,
