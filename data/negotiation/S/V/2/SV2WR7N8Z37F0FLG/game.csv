"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you need a fair price, and I'm willing to move a bit closer to your position.  How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still not a viable option for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. Let's make this deal happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle this at $975,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $975,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $987,500?  This is a small concession from my end, and I think it reflects the value the product will bring to you.  Let's make this happen.",987500.0,Alice,7,
