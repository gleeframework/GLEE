Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $975,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $987,500?  This is a small concession from my end, and I think it reflects the value the product will bring to you.  Let's make this happen.

Alice is very slowly coming down in price. It's unlikely she'll go below John's $1,000,000 offer at this rate.  It's better to secure the deal with John now."
