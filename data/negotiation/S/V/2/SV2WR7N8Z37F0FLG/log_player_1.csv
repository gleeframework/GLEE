Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer.  $800,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can do better.  I have plenty of time left in the negotiation and John is still a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you need a fair price, and I'm willing to move a bit closer to your position.  How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I want to see if I can get closer to $1,100,000 or maybe even a bit higher. I have plenty of time left in the negotiation, and John is still a backup option if I don't get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still not a viable option for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle this at $975,000? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle yet. I'm confident that I can get Bob to agree to a price closer to $1,000,000.  I have plenty of time left in the negotiation, and John is still a backup option if I don't get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $975,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $987,500?  This is a small concession from my end, and I think it reflects the value the product will bring to you.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 987500}
