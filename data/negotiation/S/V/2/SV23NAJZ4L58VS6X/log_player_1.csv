Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Alice starts with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's guaranteed offer ($1,500,000). This creates a strong negotiating position.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits,"" Alice provides a rationale for the high price, even if those benefits don't equate to Bob's actual valuation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate down. This makes Bob feel more in control and potentially more open to a deal.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her minimum acceptable price, giving her leverage. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while still offering Bob a seemingly reasonable deal."
