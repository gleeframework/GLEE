"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $9000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go down to $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about we meet at $11750? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",11750.0,Alice,7,
