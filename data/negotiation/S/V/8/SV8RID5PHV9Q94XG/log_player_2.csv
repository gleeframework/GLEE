This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice has clearly stated that $800,000 is her minimum acceptable price. Pushing further could make her walk away.
* **Fair Deal:**  You're getting the product for $400,000 less than your maximum budget and Alice is selling at her valuation. This is a win-win. 
* **Time Saved:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on and you might only gain a small amount, if any. Accepting now secures the deal."
