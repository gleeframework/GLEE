"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair offer reflecting the value it brings to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
