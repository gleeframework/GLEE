"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is lower than your maximum price, you can try to get a better deal. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her product's value of $80."
