"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $900,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable price for me. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While he's getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I want to see if I can push him further or if I should sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession and come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,005,000, but no more. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,005,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $1,005,000 is only slightly below the guaranteed $1,000,000 I can get from John.  It's worth closing the deal and securing this profit, rather than risking further negotiation and potentially losing a sale entirely."
