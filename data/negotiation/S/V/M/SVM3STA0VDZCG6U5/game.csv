,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession and come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
