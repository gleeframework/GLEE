"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is your maximum budget, there's no reason to accept the first offer.  You have 10 rounds and the ability to counteroffer. This gives you leverage to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer (10% off) shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This establishes your bargaining position early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still not the best deal possible.  Since you have 7 rounds left, there's room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for more potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already moved closer to your target price.  This counteroffer is a smaller step closer, but it still shows your willingness to negotiate.  It also leaves some room for Alice to come down further if she's motivated to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to your target price and you've already had several rounds of negotiation.  With only 5 rounds left, it's worth accepting the offer to secure a good price. 

The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice may not budge further and you might end up losing the opportunity to get this price.  It's better to secure this deal rather than risk potentially getting a worse price later."
