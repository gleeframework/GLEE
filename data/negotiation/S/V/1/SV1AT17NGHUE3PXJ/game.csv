"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,200,000. The product is a valuable asset, and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I think this price is fair, considering your interest in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
