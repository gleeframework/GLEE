{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price is fair given its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** It leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense of getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear starting point:** The message sets the tone for a fair and respectful negotiation. 

Keep in mind that this is just a starting point. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and John's potential offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, you're likely to get a better price. Here's why:

* **Bob's motivation:** Bob clearly values the product at $1,500,000, so he's still motivated to reach a deal.
* **Negotiation space:** You have room to counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price. 
* **John's offer:**  You can still fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal your willingness to negotiate further and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,200,000. The product is a valuable asset, and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I think this price is fair, considering your interest in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a strategic move:

* **Compromise:** You're showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's price.
* **Midpoint:**  $1,300,000 is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Motivation:** You're maintaining your stance that the product is valuable while giving Bob a reason to agree.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and gives you a better chance of getting a price closer to your ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Close to your target:**  $1,250,000 is significantly closer to your goal of $1,400,000 than John's offer of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While it might be tempting to try for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer suggests that he's likely at his limit. Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a longer negotiation process.
* **Time and effort:**  Accepting Bob's offer will save you time and effort in continuing the negotiation process.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a solid profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's lower price."
