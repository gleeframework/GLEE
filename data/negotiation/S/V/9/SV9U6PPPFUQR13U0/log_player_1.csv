Round 2

While $6,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price, but I'm getting nervous about running out of time. I'll try to counter with a slightly higher offer."
