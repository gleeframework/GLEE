"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'll sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is my best offer, and it's still a significant amount for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'll sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still quite a stretch for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
