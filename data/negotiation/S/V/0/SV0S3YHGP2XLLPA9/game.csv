"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for a product that I'm excited about.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, I believe $1,400,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, so I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is my final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
