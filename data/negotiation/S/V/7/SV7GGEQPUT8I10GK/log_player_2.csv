"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a better price than John's $150, there's room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to go that low? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $100, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you halfway, though. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within Bob's budget and a better deal than John's $150.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will either reject the counteroffer or walk away from the deal altogether.  Accepting the $110 offer is a good compromise."
