"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $1,150,000 price leaves room for potential counteroffers and negotiation.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** While I'm aiming high, I'm not going all-in. This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting it wouldn't leave me any profit beyond my minimum value.
* **Selling to John isn't ideal:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, I believe I can potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob.  
* **Continuing negotiation:**  I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations. This allows me to explore the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price slightly:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000 to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** This price remains above my minimum value of $1,000,000, ensuring I still make a profit. 
* **Testing Bob's willingness:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's true buying power and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Selling to John is still not ideal:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, I believe I can potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob, even though he's currently offering less.
* **Continuing negotiation:** I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations. This allows me to explore the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob.  There are still several rounds left, and I may be able to get a price closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm lowering my price again, this time to $1,050,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer.  
* **Showing willingness to compromise:** This move demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Minimizing risk:** While this price is closer to Bob's initial offer, it's still above my minimum, ensuring that I make a profit. 
* **Building momentum:**  This counteroffer is a step towards finding a middle ground and potentially closing the deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, it's not enough to make it worthwhile for me.
* **Selling to John is tempting:** This offer is very close to what John is willing to pay. However, I still believe that I can potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Limited rounds:** With only four rounds left, I need to start making decisions that balance potential profits with the risk of running out of time.
* **Continuing negotiation:**  I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations. I'm hoping to get a higher price from Bob, but I'm also aware that I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** I'm lowering my offer again, but this time only by $25,000. This keeps the price relatively close to my previous offer, showing I'm still willing to negotiate, but also demonstrates that I won't accept offers significantly below my target.
* **Testing Bob's limits:** I'm aiming to see how close Bob is willing to get to my desired price. With only three rounds left, I need to quickly gauge his willingness to compromise.
* **Minimizing risk:**  This price is still above my minimum, ensuring I make a profit.  
* **Building momentum:** This counteroffer aims to create a sense of urgency for Bob and potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds remaining, it's unlikely I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Bob's offer is still below minimum:**  $987,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John's offer guarantees a profit of $1,000,000, which meets my minimum requirements. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, accepting John's offer ensures I don't lose money or risk running out of time before reaching an agreement with Bob. 

It's a strategic decision to take the guaranteed profit and avoid further negotiation with Bob, especially with limited time remaining."
