"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $700000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and the benefits it can bring to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not sure if $800000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's worth the investment. I'm thinking of $750000 as a more reasonable price. Can you consider this offer?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $750000. Considering the product's unique features and the benefits it can bring to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering it to you for $825000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure it's worth the investment. I'm thinking of $785000 as a more reasonable price. Can you consider this offer?",785000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $800000. I've already made significant concessions, and I believe this is the best price I can offer. If you're not willing to meet me at $800000, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $1000000, and I think that's a better deal for you than walking away.",800000.0,Alice,9,
