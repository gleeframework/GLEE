"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is way too high.  It's important to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give us room for negotiation and signal that we're serious about a lower price point. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  We want to maintain a positive tone and express our interest in the product while still being firm about our budget.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""around $10,000"" suggests we're open to some movement on the price, but it sets a clear target for Alice."
