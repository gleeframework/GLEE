Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's significantly lower than what I'd get from another buyer. This is a rare opportunity for you to acquire it at a great value.  The price is $1,700,000.  It's a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've set the price at $1,700,000. This is a significant discount from what I'd get from John, but it still gives me a profit.
* **Message:** I've framed the message to emphasize the value proposition for Bob. I've mentioned the discount compared to other buyers, and highlighted the potential benefits of acquiring the product at this price. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize Profit:** While $1,700,000 is less than what John is offering, it's still a good profit margin.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:** By setting a slightly lower price than I'd be willing to accept, I leave room for negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning the other buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency for Bob, potentially motivating him to accept the offer."
