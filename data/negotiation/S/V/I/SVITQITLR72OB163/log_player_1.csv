Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will either accept or counter with a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$60 is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100, which is still a good profit for me, but closer to what Bob might be willing to pay. This should give us some room to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than $60, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $90. This is a reasonable compromise that still gets me closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will finally accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This negotiation is going nowhere.  Bob is unwilling to come close to my minimum price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $120."
