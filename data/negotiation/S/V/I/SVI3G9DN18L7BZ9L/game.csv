"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $80 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $95? That would give us both a good deal.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90, which would be $87.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $87.50 is still too low for me. Given our limited time, I'm willing to make a final compromise. How about $90? This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the product.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,7,
