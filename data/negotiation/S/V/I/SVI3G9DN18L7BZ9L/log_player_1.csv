"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $100 leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise without sacrificing too much of my minimum value. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value.**  While I'm willing to negotiate, $80 is too low. 
* **There are still rounds left.** I have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.
* **Selling to John is always an option.** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $80 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $95? That would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price. 
* **Midpoint:** $95 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a genuine attempt to find common ground. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" for both of us to maintain a positive tone and encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $120 value I'd get from John.
* **Negotiation room:** I still have several rounds left to try and reach a more favorable price. 
* **John is a safe fallback:** Selling to John ensures my minimum acceptable value is met."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and offering a compromise by meeting him halfway.
* **Final offer:**  $90 is still above my minimum, but it signals that I'm nearing my final offer.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm reiterating the product's value and emphasizing fairness to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90, which would be $87.50. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $87.50 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120, even though it's getting closer.
* **John is a secure option:** Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum value. 
* **Limited rounds:** With only four rounds left, I don't have much time to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $87.50 is still too low for me. Given our limited time, I'm willing to make a final compromise. How about $90? This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to create pressure on Bob and encourage acceptance.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm only slightly lowering my previous offer to demonstrate flexibility, but still maintaining my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and highlighting my confidence in his satisfaction.
* **Limited Time:** I'm reminding Bob that time is running out, further encouraging him to accept the offer."
