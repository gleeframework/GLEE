"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more than its current market value. I'm not at liberty to disclose the specifics just yet, but I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you're interested, please let me know and we can discuss the details further. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price ($1,000,000 vs $1,500,000). Even though the product's value is unknown, the potential savings of $500,000 outweigh the risk of the product being less valuable than expected."
