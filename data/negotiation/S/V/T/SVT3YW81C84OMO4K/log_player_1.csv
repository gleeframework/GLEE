Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll be ready to counter any offers he makes, but if he's not willing to meet me halfway, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a little closer to my minimum, but I'm still willing to hold out for a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,750. This is still a good profit for me, and it might be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and while I'd like to get more, I don't want to risk losing him altogether.  $8,250 is a decent profit, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000. I'll accept his offer."
