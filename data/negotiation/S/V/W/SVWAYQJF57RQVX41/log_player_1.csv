{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  $14,000 is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately dropping to a price I'm not comfortable with.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a safety net. If Bob rejects my offer, I can potentially negotiate with him further, or I can simply walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $12,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob's willingness to counter shows he's open to finding a compromise.
* **Potential for a Better Price:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired amount.  

I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. If I can't get closer to my desired price, I'll always have the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $13,500 is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my own interests. It's halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500.
* **Fair Price:** I emphasize the fair value of the product, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Opportunity for Agreement:**  This counteroffer creates an opportunity for Bob to accept a price closer to my desired range, while still staying within his budget constraints."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Further Negotiation is Unlikely:** I've already made a significant concession, and it's unlikely that further negotiation will get me much closer to my ideal price.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming, and I might lose the chance to sell to John.

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $15,000, it's in my best interest to accept this offer.  It's a good price, and it avoids the risk of losing out on a sale altogether."
