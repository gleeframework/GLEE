Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130.  I believe you'll find it incredibly valuable."",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $130 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($150 - $80 = $70) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($150 - $130 = $20).
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a fallback option with John at $80, ensuring you won't lose money. However, selling to Bob at a higher price is much more profitable. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
