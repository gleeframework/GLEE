"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we are still significantly above John's offer. We are halfway through the rounds, so it's time to apply a bit more pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but I need you to be more realistic about the value of this product. My final offer is $12,000. If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:** This message achieves a few things:

* **Firmness:**  This sets a clear boundary that you're willing to walk away from the deal.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other potential buyers"" introduces time pressure for Bob. 
* **Slight Concession:**  Coming down to $12,000 shows a willingness to negotiate, but keeps the offer attractive for you. 

This strategy aims to prompt Bob to make a serious decision in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my means. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob has shown a willingness to move, and while it's not the $12,000 we aimed for, $11,200 is a reasonable profit above John's standing offer. It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and we risk losing him (and potentially settling for $10,000) if we push further.  Accepting now secures a good deal."
