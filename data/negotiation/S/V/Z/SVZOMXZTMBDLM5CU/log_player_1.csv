"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) to see if I can gauge his interest and potentially negotiate upwards.  I'm also leaving myself some room to lower the price in later rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $14,000. This is still above his offer but lower than my initial offer, showing I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my initial goal, it's higher than my minimum and getting closer to my initial ask.  With only 6 rounds left, it's a good deal and less risky than continuing to negotiate."
