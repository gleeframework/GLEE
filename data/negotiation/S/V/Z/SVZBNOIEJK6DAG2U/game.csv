"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I would like to make a counteroffer of $12000 for the product. This still reflects its true value, but I am willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $10000, which is my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
