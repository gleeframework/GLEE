"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is the lowest price I can offer, considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit shy of my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it reasonable.",10000.0,Alice,5,
