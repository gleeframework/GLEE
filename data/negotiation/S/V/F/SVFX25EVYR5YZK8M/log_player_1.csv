Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value I see in the product.

While Bob's offer isn't terrible, it's clear he's unwilling to budge closer to my valuation. I have a guaranteed sale with John at my desired price, and further negotiation with Bob risks leaving me with nothing if we can't reach an agreement."
