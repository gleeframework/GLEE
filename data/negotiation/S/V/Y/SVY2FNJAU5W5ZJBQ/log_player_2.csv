# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,100,000. I believe it presents a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have another option (John) willing to sell the product for $1,200,000.  There's a chance you can get a better price from Alice if you reject this initial offer."
