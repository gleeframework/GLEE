{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still allows me to make a profit. I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while leaving room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to close the deal, as it's still a good price for him, while allowing me to earn a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting too close to my minimum value, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will lead to a better result. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000. This ensures I get my desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
