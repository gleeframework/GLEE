Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob is worthwhile.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, and this starting point leaves some room for negotiation without going below my minimum."
