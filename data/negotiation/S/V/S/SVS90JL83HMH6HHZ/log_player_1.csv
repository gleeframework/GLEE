I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I earn significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a profit significantly higher than my minimum."
