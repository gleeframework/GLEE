"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what I need to get for this product. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not there.  $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $1,150,000? That's a good compromise, and gives us both something to work with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for your latest offer. I am willing to consider $1,125,000 as a counterproposal. This brings us closer together and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can squeeze a bit more out of the deal. I'm going to try and push him a little further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  $1,137,500 is my final offer.  If you're serious about buying, this is your chance.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1137500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to reach an agreement. I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose $1,130,000 as a counteroffer. This brings us even closer together and I believe it is a fair price for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,130,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting very close to my minimum acceptable amount, and I'm concerned that if I keep pushing, I might lose the deal entirely.  It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than to risk getting nothing at all."
