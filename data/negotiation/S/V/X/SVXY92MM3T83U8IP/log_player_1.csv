Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High but Reasonable:**  Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price ($1,450,000) leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit.
* **Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  Ending with an invitation to discuss keeps the lines of communication open if Bob wants to negotiate."
