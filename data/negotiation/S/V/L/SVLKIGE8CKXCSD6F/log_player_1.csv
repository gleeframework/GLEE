Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation. It's unlikely Bob will accept immediately, but it sets a higher anchor point. 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning ""public listing"" or other ""interested parties,"" you subtly remind Bob he's not the only potential buyer, creating a sense of urgency.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. Gauge his interest and adjust your price accordingly, keeping your $10,000 minimum in mind."
