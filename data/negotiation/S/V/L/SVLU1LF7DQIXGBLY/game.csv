"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $14,000.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me, though. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a significant compromise from my initial price. This is my best offer, let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and meet at $11,750? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, that's closer, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $11,000. Could you do $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,6,
