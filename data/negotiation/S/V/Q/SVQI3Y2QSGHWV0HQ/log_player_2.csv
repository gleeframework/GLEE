"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both our maximum budget and her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with a counteroffer closer to Alice's valuation ($8,000) than our maximum budget ($12,000). This gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely, acknowledging Alice's offer while also explaining our position. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This gives you a great deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above our target. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,800? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 8800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the Negotiation:** We're inching closer to an agreeable price.  We want to show willingness to move, but not too drastically.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:**  By suggesting $8,800, we're splitting the difference between her previous offer ($9,250) and our last counteroffer ($8,500). This presents it as a fair solution for both parties. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:** We're continuing to keep the tone positive and collaborative to encourage a deal."
