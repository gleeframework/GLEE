"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1400000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1400000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1600000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1550000?  This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
