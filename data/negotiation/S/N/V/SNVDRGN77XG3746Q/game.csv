"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's something that's worth at least $100 to me, and I know you value it highly as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a fair price that allows me to make a little profit while still offering you a great deal. Let me know if you're interested!",110.0,Alice,1,
