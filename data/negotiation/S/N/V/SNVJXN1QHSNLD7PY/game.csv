"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. I would like to counter with an offer of $950,000 for your product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gets us both closer to a deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, but given my financial situation, I can't agree to $975,000. I would like to propose $960,000 as a compromise.",960000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $960,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle at $965,000?  It's a small difference, but it gets us closer to a deal, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",965000.0,Alice,5,
