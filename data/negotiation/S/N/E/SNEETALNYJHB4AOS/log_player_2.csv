"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking $95 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You want to save as much money as possible, and $95 is still a bit higher than your ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $90 is better than $95, you're still trying to get the best deal possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a price closer to your desired $85."
