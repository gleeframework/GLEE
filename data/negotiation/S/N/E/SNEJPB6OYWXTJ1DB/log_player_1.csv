Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $14,000 is higher than what Bob believes the product is worth, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $14,000 is still above your minimum price of $15,000, ensuring you profit from the sale.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still space to negotiate downwards if Bob pushes for a lower price, but it also allows you to potentially get a higher price if he's eager. 

This strategy allows for a balanced negotiation where you can explore if you can secure a price closer to your value while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he got a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to keep my expenses within $12,000. Would you be able to consider a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a better outcome. However, there's still potential to get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $13,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a more reasonable price for my product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose $13,000 as a compromise. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $500 less than my previous counteroffer of $13,500. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum. Considering that John is offering $15,000, accepting Bob's offer means losing out on $2,000.  However, it's a more reasonable compromise and allows me to avoid further negotiation, which could be time-consuming and potentially lead to a lower price."
