"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,250,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This price still allows me to acquire a valuable asset while keeping within my financial limits. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below the value I need to receive for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,150,000.  This price still allows you a considerable gain while ensuring I receive a fair return. I believe this is a reasonable compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
