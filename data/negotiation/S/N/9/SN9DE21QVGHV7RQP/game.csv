"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still not quite there.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This leaves room for both of us to feel like we've gotten a good price. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on your offer, but $1250000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $1275000?  This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good outcome. Let me know what you think.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
