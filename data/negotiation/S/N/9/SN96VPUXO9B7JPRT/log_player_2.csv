It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room to save some money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you and the potential savings for me. What do you think?

Alice's counteroffer is a good compromise.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal to John or having the negotiation drag on for too long outweighs the potential savings of a few more thousand dollars."
