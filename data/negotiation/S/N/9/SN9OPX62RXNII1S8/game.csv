"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50? That would be a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far off from $82.50. How about we meet at $78? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",78.0,Bob,4,
