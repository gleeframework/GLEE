"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, you can potentially get a better price by counter-offering. Since your maximum budget is $120, and Alice values the product at $80, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to pay closer to $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $95 is still within your budget. Accepting her offer ensures you get the product for a good price without risking a further negotiation that might lead to a higher price or a deal falling through entirely."
