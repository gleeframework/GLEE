"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm asking $18000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $18000 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $12000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13500.  Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,4,
