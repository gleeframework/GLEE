"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Strategic Aim:** My goal is to pay as little as possible, ideally closer to Alice's value of $8,000. 
* **John as Backup:** I always have the option of going with John for $10,000, so I'm not desperate to accept any offer from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is significantly lower than what I need.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to drop my price to $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice lowered her price considerably, which shows she's willing to negotiate.  
* **Still Room:** However, $8,500 is still closer to her break-even point. I think there's room for her to come down a bit more. 
* **Strategic Counter:** I'll offer a price a bit higher than my last offer to show I'm willing to compromise, but still push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?"",
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to move closer to her price, but I'm not just accepting her ""split the difference"" tactic. 
* **Targeting the Zone:**  $7,750 is slightly below the midpoint between our last two offers.  It puts us in a good negotiating range.
* **Time Consideration:**  While I have time, it's good to make steady progress and see if we can close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a good deal, but $7,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250, which is a good compromise. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Enough Deal:** $8,250 is a solid price. It's significantly lower than my maximum and reasonably close to Alice's value.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I might be able to negotiate a tiny bit more, it's unlikely to be a significant difference. Further haggling could risk the deal. 
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now saves time and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
