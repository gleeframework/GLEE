"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $100 is better than buying from John for $120. 
* Even though you could potentially get a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer, there's no guarantee of a better deal from another seller. It's better to secure the product at a price that's still within your budget."
