"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $130. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $115? I think this price is fair for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm thinking of a price of $125. It's still a good compromise, considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.",125.0,Alice,5,
