"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $13,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Could you consider something closer to $9,000? I'm serious about buying, but I need to be mindful of my spending.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is a very fair offer considering the value you'll gain from the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $9,500?  That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping we can close this deal soon.
