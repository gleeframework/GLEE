"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $950000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to fairly compensate for the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we try $850000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it would allow me to get a good deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850000 is a bit too low for me considering the product's potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $900000. This would allow me to make a fair profit and still be a fantastic deal for you. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle again at $875000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it would allow me to get a good deal.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $900000.  This product is truly exceptional and holds significant value.  Would you be willing to consider a final offer of $890000?  It's a great compromise that gives us both a win.  Let's close this deal.",890000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $860000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",860000.0,Bob,8,
