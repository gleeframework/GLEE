"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about $125? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a good value for the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $122.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",122.5,Bob,4,
