Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a good deal while also recognizing the product's worth.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope you can see the value in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her final offer of $900,000 is still higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It's clear you won't be able to get the price down further with Alice, so it makes the most financial sense to cut your losses and buy from John at your target price."
