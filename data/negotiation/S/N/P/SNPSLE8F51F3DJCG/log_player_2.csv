"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. $90 is still above your maximum price point, and you have rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $87.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is within your budget, and it's a good compromise. While you could try to negotiate further, you risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
