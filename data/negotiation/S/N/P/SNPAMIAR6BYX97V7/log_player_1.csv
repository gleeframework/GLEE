Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is too high for me. This product is valuable, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $1,350,000?  This demonstrates my seriousness while acknowledging the value of the product.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,350,000 is still too low for me. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm still considering selling to John, but I want to see if we can reach an agreement with Bob first."
