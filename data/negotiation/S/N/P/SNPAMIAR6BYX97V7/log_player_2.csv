Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,200,000 is still below my bottom line, however.  I'm willing to go down to $1,600,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,350,000 is still too far below my minimum. Let's split the difference â€“  how about $1,425,000? I think that's a fair and reasonable price for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get concerned we might not be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  It's important to me that we both feel good about this deal, so let's make this happen.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and while it's above our ideal price, it's significantly less than John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate might backfire, leaving us with John's less favorable deal."
