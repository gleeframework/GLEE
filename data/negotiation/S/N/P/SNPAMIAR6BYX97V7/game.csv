"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm starting with an offer of $1,800,000.  It's a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is too high for me. This product is valuable, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,200,000 is still below my bottom line, however.  I'm willing to go down to $1,600,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $1,350,000?  This demonstrates my seriousness while acknowledging the value of the product.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,350,000 is still too far below my minimum. Let's split the difference â€“  how about $1,425,000? I think that's a fair and reasonable price for both of us.",1425000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to get concerned we might not be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  It's important to me that we both feel good about this deal, so let's make this happen.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
