"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to propose a price of $1,150,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about $1,200,000? This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
