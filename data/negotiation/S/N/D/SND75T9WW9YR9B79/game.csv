"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll sell it to you for $95. This is my final counteroffer.",95.0,Alice,5,
