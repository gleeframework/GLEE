"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet closer to the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $90 is still too low for me.  How about $110? This is my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
