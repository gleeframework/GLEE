Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate but I won't go below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  John's offer is my safety net, so I have room to play."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I need to make more than $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm coming down a bit, but I'm still holding firm to making a decent profit.  This is a compromise, but I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price.  John's offer is a secure deal that meets my minimum, so I'm going to take it."
