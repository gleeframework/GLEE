Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140.  I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $150 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 offers a significant discount to Bob (almost 30% off his perceived value) making it more likely he'll accept. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy for $150 gives Alice leverage.  She doesn't need to go below her minimum.

**Why not other prices?**

* **$150 or higher:** Bob will definitely reject, knowing he can get it cheaper elsewhere.
* **Between $100 and $140:**  While Bob might accept, Alice loses potential profit.  

This strategy aims for the highest possible gain while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
