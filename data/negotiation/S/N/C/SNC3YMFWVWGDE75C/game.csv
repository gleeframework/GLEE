"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. I'm asking for $15,000 to start.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and I think this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $15,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $12,000, which would be $12,750. Can we discuss this further?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you seem serious about this product and I want to make a deal.  However, I need a bit more to make it worth my while.  Let's try $13,125 and see if we can close this out.",13125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $13,125 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. Can we shake on it at this price?",12500.0,Bob,6,
