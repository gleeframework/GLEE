"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something that I value at least $80, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance you can get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her $80 value."
