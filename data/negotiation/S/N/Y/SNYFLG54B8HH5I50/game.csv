"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1350000. This is my final offer in this range, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm making a fair profit. I can offer it to you for $1320000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1320000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $1280000. This is my last offer in this range, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
