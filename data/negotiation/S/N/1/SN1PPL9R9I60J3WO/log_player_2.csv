"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than my maximum budget ($80). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still stay within a reasonable price range. 
* **Anchoring:**  By throwing out a low number first, I'm trying to influence Alice's perception of the product's value. She might be more open to a counteroffer closer to my price if I anchor her to a lower number initially. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I understand this is just the beginning of the negotiation. I expect Alice to counter, and I'm prepared to gradually increase my offer over subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While $100 is closer to my budget, it's still significantly more than I want to spend, especially knowing I have the option to buy from John for $80. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  Alice is showing willingness to negotiate by coming down in price.  This suggests there's room for further bargaining. I'll continue to counter-offer in hopes of getting closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we try to find a middle ground? Would you consider $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by increasing my offer significantly from $60 to $75. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying but still want a fair price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My offer of $75 is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($60) and Alice's current offer ($90).  This reinforces the idea of finding a ""middle ground.""
* **Nearing Walk-Away Point:** I'm getting closer to my maximum budget of $80. If Alice doesn't accept this offer or come down significantly in her next counter, I'll likely walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise again and sell the product to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Alice has increased her offer from $100 to $110. This suggests she's not willing to come down to a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  We've gone through five rounds, and the price difference is still significant.  I'm concerned about continuing to negotiate with no guarantee of a favorable outcome.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** I have a standing offer from John for $80. This is a much better deal than anything Alice is currently offering. It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take the guaranteed savings."
