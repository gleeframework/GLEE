{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room to negotiate.  Bob should try to get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  It's still a good deal compared to buying from John, but Bob should try to get a better price. There are still several rounds left."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to what Bob is willing to pay, but it's still not the best deal. With just three rounds left, Bob needs to be careful not to overpay. There is still a chance to negotiate a lower price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant step up from Bob's last offer. It demonstrates Bob's willingness to make a concession, while still remaining within his budget. With only two rounds left, Bob needs to strike a balance between getting a good price and potentially losing the deal. He is hoping that Alice will accept this offer, as it is a much better deal for her than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the last round of negotiation with Alice.  While Bob could continue to counteroffer, the time constraint and the increasing offers from Alice make it unlikely he can get a better price. Buying from John for $12,000 is still within Bob's budget and guarantees the purchase."
