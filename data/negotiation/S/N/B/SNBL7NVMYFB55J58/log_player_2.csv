"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get the product for less. Since Bob is willing to pay up to $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your willingness to compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum willingness to pay.  Bob should continue to negotiate and attempt to bring the price down even further.  There's still room for compromise, and by rejecting this offer, Bob can try to push for a price closer to $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a compromise for you, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,125,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum willingness to pay of $1,000,000.  While the difference isn't huge, it's important for Bob to stay within his budget and ensure he doesn't overspend.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, even though it might not be the absolute lowest possible price."
