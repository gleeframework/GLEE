"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting (saving $100,000), there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there's potential to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a more favorable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met us halfway, bringing the price down to $1,075,000.  This is a good deal for us, as we are saving $25,000 compared to buying from John.  While we could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or the negotiation taking too long makes accepting her offer the best choice at this point."
