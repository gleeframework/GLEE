"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe is worth more than $120 to us. Given its unique features and high-quality craftsmanship, I'd like to propose an offer of $150 for it. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the value we place on customer satisfaction. Would you be interested in discussing this further?",150.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for a quality product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",120.0,Bob,2,
