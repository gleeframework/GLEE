Given its unique features and high-quality craftsmanship, I'd like to propose an offer of $150 for it.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for a quality product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.
