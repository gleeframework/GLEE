Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't afford that price.  I'm willing to pay $8000, which is my maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
