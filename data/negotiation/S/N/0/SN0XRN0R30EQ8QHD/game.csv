"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price of $1100000. It's a significant deal for you, as the product is worth $800000 to you. This is a one-time offer, so consider it carefully. If you decline, I will be selling it to John for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, allowing you a substantial profit margin.  Let me know your decision.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
