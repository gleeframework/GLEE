Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum value, leaving room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. It's also polite and encourages a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product. I understand its value might be higher to you, but based on my assessment, I am willing to pay up to $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but accepting it is better than risking a longer negotiation that might lead to a lower price or the need to sell to John."
