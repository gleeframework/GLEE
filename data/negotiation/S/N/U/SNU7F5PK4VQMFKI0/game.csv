"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1800000. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential value. I believe this price reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in my product.  $900000 is a bit too low for me, considering its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1350000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. Can you consider $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is closer, but still a little below my minimum.  To make this work, I'd need $1150000. This price reflects the product's value and allows me to  avoid selling to John.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $1150000, which is $1100000. That's the highest I can go. Can you consider this price?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
