Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential value. Please consider my offer carefully."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  The message is designed to pique Bob's interest and highlight the potential value of the product. It emphasizes the benefit to Bob while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Product Price:** The price is set at $1,550,000. This is slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,500,000) but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay.  This gives me some room for negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer.

**Why this strategy:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I'm aiming to secure a slightly higher price than my minimum, which will increase my profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Setting a price slightly higher than my minimum allows for a possible negotiation and a potential compromise with Bob.
* **Back-up Plan:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose out on the deal entirely."
