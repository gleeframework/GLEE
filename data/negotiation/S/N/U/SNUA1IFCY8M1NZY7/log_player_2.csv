```

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay $150 for the product, and Alice is offering it at $150. While Alice might be trying to convince you it's worth more, the information provided doesn't give you any reason to believe her product is better than what John is selling for the same price.  Therefore, you should reject the offer and buy from John, as you have no incentive to accept Alice's offer."
