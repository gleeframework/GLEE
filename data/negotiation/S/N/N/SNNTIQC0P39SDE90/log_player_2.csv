# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price.

Alice has come down to $1,050,000 which is a good price for Bob, considering John is selling the same product for $1,200,000. It's worth accepting the offer and saving the additional $150,000."
