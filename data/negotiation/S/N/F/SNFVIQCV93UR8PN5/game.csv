"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. Can we discuss this further?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, so I'll offer you $10,000. This is my final offer for now.",10000.0,Alice,5,
