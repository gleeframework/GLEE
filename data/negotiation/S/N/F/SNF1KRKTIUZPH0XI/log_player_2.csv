"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $70 is below Alice's value of $80, but it's a starting point.  It lets Alice know we're serious but also trying to save money.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone of the message remains polite and suggests a willingness to continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? Let's try to find a price we're both happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a price we'd consider, but it's still above our target. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and lets Alice make another move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:** We're increasing our offer, signaling we're willing to compromise. 
* **Targeting the Midpoint:**  $77 represents a near-perfect split between the previous offer ($85) and our counteroffer ($70). It suggests fairness.
* **Maintaining a Good Deal:**  $77 is still significantly below John's price and a good value for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $77 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $81?  That way we're both getting closer to what we want. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $81 is within our acceptable price range and a good compromise.
* **Limited Time:**  We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds, and further haggling might not yield significant gains.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing might lead Alice to withdraw the offer or get closer to John's $100 price, making the potential savings negligible."
