Round 2

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? Let's try to find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 85}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $77 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a bit more.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
