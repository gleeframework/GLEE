Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) than your minimum ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Sale:** The offer is still attractive enough compared to Bob's perceived value, making it likely he'll accept and avoid the risk of you selling to John."
