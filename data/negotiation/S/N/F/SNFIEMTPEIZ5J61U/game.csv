"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it, considering your value and my own.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,150,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  How about $1,125,000? It's a fair compromise and keeps the deal moving forward.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,137,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and I think it's a good compromise.",1137500.0,Alice,5,
