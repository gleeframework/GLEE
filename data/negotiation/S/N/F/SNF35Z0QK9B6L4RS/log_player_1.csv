Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is higher than my minimum value of $80, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is within my acceptable range, and it's better than selling to John for $80.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and secure the sale."
