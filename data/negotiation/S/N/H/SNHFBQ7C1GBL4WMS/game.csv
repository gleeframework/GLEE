"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my asking price but still a fair profit for me.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. This considers a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable investment.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer you the product for $700,000. This gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a profit.  What do you say?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $800,000.  While $700,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $650,000. Would you consider $650,000 for the product? This would be a beneficial deal for me and still allow you a decent profit.",650000.0,Bob,4,
