"Thanks for offering! That's a bit high for my budget, though. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can offer you a compromise. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer considering its value to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $9,000, which is $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Alice,5,
