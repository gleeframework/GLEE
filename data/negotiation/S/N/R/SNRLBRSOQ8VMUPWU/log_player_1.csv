""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's potential to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Setting the price at $1,400,000 creates a significant profit margin while still being attractive to Bob, as it saves him $100,000 compared to his perceived value.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By emphasizing a limited-time offer and exclusivity, I aim to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
