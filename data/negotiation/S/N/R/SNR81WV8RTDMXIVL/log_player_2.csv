I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal than Alice's offer of $1,100,000.  You're trying to save as much money as possible, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the optimal strategy."
