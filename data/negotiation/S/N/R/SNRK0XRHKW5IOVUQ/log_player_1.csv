Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"" and ""worth,"" you're subtly reminding Bob of the product's significance and justifying a price higher than your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is polite and inquisitive, suggesting you're open to discussing the price further, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in negotiation. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is a starting point.  How you proceed depends on Bob's response. Be prepared to potentially negotiate down, but always keep your $1,200,000 minimum in mind."
