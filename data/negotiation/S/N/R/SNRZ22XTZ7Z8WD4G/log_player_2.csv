Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this negotiation. While $1,800,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I appreciate your persistence.  While I value finding a compromise, I believe $1,950,000 still undervalues the product's potential.
