Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still allows you a good profit margin, and it's a significant step towards a deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $1,000,000 is still within his budget and a better deal than buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it."
