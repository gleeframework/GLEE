"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still allows you a good profit margin, and it's a significant step towards a deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
