"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,500. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $10,000, Bob can still get a better deal by negotiating further or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer to signal his intention to negotiate.  $8,500 is still a good deal for Alice, as it's higher than her own minimum value of $8,000. This is a reasonable starting point to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000, considering your interest.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is only $500 more than Bob's ideal price of $8,500.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Alice and ending up buying from John for $8,000 anyway."
