"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to commit up to $800,000 for it. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the $800,000 offer is significantly below its true worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,900,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet you at $1,900,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,200,000. I believe this strikes a balance between respecting the product's worth and staying within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer to a reasonable range.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am prepared to offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects its value while staying within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
