"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $120 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $160. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $130, which is a good price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $145. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
