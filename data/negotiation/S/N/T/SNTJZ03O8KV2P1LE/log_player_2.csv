"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you might be interested in. It's a high-quality item that I'm willing to let go of for a good price. Would you like to take a look? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you're willing to pay $100 for the product from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $100.  You're essentially getting the same deal from John, and you don't know if Alice is willing to negotiate."
