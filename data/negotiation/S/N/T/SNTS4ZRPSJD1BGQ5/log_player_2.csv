Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $11,000?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is close to your desired price point, and it's getting increasingly risky to continue haggling.  There's a chance you might not get a better offer from Alice, and you risk running out of rounds.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing it to another seller or running out of negotiating time."
