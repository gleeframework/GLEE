Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident that the product is worth at least this much to me, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for it.  

I'll be ready to counter-offer if Bob rejects this initial offer. I'll also keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer with a price closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer, and it's within my acceptable range.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell him the product."
