"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. It's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. Let's work together to close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,250 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet at $9,750? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this now!",9750.0,Alice,5,
