Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,600,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  A starting price of $1,600,000 gives you room to negotiate while aiming for a profit of $400,000. 
* **Confident Language:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Keep in mind that Bob knows the product's value to him is $1,200,000. Your offer needs to justify the higher price. You might want to emphasize unique features, potential return on investment, or scarcity of the product.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in place is key to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
