"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get a price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Aiming Low:** Our goal is to get as close to $8,000 (Alice's value) as possible, so we're aiming a bit lower to start.
* **Polite and Open:** We want to keep the negotiation amicable and collaborative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to her perceived value, $8,500 is still above what it's worth to her. There's room for further negotiation. We'll try to nudge the price down a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving up from our previous offer, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate, but keeping the increase substantial.
* **Targeting a Fair Deal:** $7,000 is a significant saving from Alice's initial offer and puts us in a good position to potentially reach an agreement closer to $8,000. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** We continue to express appreciation and frame the offer as mutually beneficial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $7,000 yet. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer it to you for $8,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met her perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer ensures we get the best possible price and avoids the risk of her raising the price again in future rounds."
