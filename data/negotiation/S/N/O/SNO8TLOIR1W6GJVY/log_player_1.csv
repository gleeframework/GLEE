Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $1,190,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering its potential returns for you."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your valuation. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price ($1,190,000) creates a strong incentive for Bob. 
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential returns"" subtly justifies the high price and encourages Bob to focus on the perceived value rather than just the price tag.

**Why this is better than simply asking for $1,200,000:**

* By offering a price slightly below your guaranteed amount, you increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. This is because it creates a sense of urgency and makes him feel like he's getting a ""deal."" 
* Even if Bob rejects this offer, you haven't lost anything as you can still sell to John at your desired price."
