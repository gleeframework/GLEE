"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, so I'm willing to hold out for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'm confident the product is worth more than $900,000, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $950,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than my initial offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still keeping me within a reasonable price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable offer and I'm getting closer to my target price.  It's also important to consider that the negotiation is already taking time and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer. I'm happy to secure $920,000 for the product."
