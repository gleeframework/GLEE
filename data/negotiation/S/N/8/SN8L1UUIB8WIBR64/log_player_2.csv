You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. You have room to go lower than Alice's offer and still get a better deal than what John is offering."

You can still do better than $1,100,000. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further before considering John's offer."
