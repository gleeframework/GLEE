"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $10,000 gives me room to negotiate down while still ensuring a profit above my minimum of $8,000.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By saying I'm ""open to negotiation,"" I signal flexibility and invite Bob to engage in the process.
* **Curiosity:** Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to share his thoughts on the value, giving me valuable information."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Profit:** While $8,000 is my minimum, it doesn't leave me any room for profit. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not in a hurry. I want to see if I can get a higher price. 
* **Counter-Offer:** By rejecting, I can make a counter-offer that's closer to my desired price, potentially finding a middle ground.
* **Further Exploration:**  I want to explore if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. However, I'm still at a price point where I can't accept $8,000. Let's split the difference - how about $9,000?  I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to show I'm still interested in making a deal.
* **Middle Ground:**  Offering $9,000 is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still getting a price closer to my desired profit.
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  I use the phrase ""fair for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and create a shared understanding of the negotiation. 
* **Continued Interest:**  I reiterate my interest in selling to Bob, encouraging him to consider my counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $9000. How about $8500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $8,500 is above my minimum of $8,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are already in round 4, meaning I have fewer rounds to negotiate. 
* **Potential Stall:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but there's no guarantee he'll accept a higher counter-offer in the next round.
* **Risk of John:**  If I continue to reject offers, I risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for the minimum, missing out on the potential profit.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good deal and avoid potential risks in the later rounds."
