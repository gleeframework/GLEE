"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $850,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident this product has a lot of value for both of us, and I'm willing to invest $900,000.  Let's close this deal at this price, it's a fair compromise and allows me to move forward with the purchase. ",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised by coming down from $1,200,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",950000.0,Alice,5,
