"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price given the product's value to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering you a price of $875,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $875,000 is getting closer to where I need to be.  I'm willing to offer $860,000. This price is still within the range of what the product is worth to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,4,
