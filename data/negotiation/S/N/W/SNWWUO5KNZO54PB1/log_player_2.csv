"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her valuation ($900,000 vs $800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  Since I have 10 rounds and my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price given the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering you a price of $875,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $875,000, which is still higher than my target price but closer to it. I have 7 rounds left and I am confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $875,000 is getting closer to where I need to be.  I'm willing to offer $860,000. This price is still within the range of what the product is worth to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 860000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target price, but I'm not quite ready to give up on the extra $15,000. I'm willing to meet you at $870,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $870,000, which is only $10,000 higher than my previous counteroffer of $860,000.  Given that I have 5 rounds left and a significant gap between Alice's offer and my target price, I don't want to risk a stalemate and lose out on the opportunity to buy from her.  It's a good deal, considering my alternative is to pay $1,200,000 to John."
