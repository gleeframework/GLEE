"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the best price for this product. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and potential.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe my previous offer of $1,350,000 is already a fair compromise, reflecting the true value of this product. I'm willing to stand by that price. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're standing firm on your price, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the best price for this product. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,280,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
