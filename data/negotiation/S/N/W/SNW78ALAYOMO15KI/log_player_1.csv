Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, aiming slightly lower than that with Bob might secure a quicker sale and still yield a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Confident Language:**  The message uses positive and confident language to emphasize the product's value and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

This offer attempts to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer instead of going to John."
