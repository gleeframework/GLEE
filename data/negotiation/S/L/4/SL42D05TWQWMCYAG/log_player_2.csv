"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [Product Name] at a price of $1,600,000.  This is a unique opportunity to own a product that's worth $1,500,000 to you.  I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your [Relevant Area/Collection/Business].  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested party ready to purchase it at the $1,500,000 mark. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is a bluff. She claims to have another buyer at $1,500,000 (her own value for the product), making it unlikely she'd accept a lower offer. You can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
