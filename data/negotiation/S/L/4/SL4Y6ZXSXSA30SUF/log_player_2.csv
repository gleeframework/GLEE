# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the value you place on it is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to your initial value of $12,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can seal the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or him having to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting Alice's offer saves him $500 compared to buying from John."
