"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer ($6,000) leaves room for negotiation while still being within a reasonable range of your target price. This approach aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than John's offer. You have room to negotiate further, and Alice might be willing to lower the price slightly to secure the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**  You're moving closer to your limit ($8,000) but staying firm in the negotiation.  This offer:

* Shows you're serious about purchasing but not willing to overpay.
*  Leaves some room for a final counteroffer from Alice if she's really motivated to sell to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's latest offer of $8,200 is still slightly above your maximum budget of $8,000 and what John is consistently offering.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better price from Alice.  Buying from John ensures you stay within budget and avoids the risk of Alice not budging further."
