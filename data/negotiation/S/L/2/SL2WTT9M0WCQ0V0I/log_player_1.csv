{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500 is a starting point.** It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and open to negotiation.** It highlights the value of the product to Alice and sets a positive tone for the interaction.
* **This offer gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.** He knows he can get a better deal than $12,000 from John, but he needs to convince Alice to go lower. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal quickly. It's a good starting point to see how the negotiation unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While $10,500 is better than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Alice can still try to get closer to her desired price.
* **Selling to John is always an option.**  But Alice has a chance to get a better price from Bob. It's worth trying to negotiate further.

By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice can send a counteroffer and explore if they can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is reasonable:** $11,000 is a significant compromise from Alice's previous offer, but still above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Focus on value:** Alice emphasizes the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message maintains a positive tone and leaves room for further discussion. 

This counteroffer shows Alice's willingness to negotiate while staying firm on her minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,750. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to Alice's desired price, it's still below her minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  There's room to try and push Bob a little higher.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** But it's not the best outcome for Alice. She can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice can send another counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between their respective price points."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $11,250? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** Alice is willing to meet Bob halfway by offering $11,250. This shows a genuine effort to find a middle ground.
* **Emphasize Value:** Alice reiterates the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is optimistic and encouraging, signaling a willingness to reach a deal.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap with Bob while staying above her minimum acceptable price. It shows flexibility and a desire to close the deal, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $11,000. How about we meet at $11,000? I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is very close to Alice's minimum acceptable price:** $11,000 is only $1,000 below her minimum desired price, making it a tempting offer.
* **Further negotiation might be futile:**  While Alice could try to push for a higher price, it's likely Bob is at his limit. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Selling to John is a safe alternative:**  However, it's not the best outcome. Bob's offer is close enough to Alice's minimum desired price that it's worth accepting.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale that's close to Alice's target price and avoids the risk of losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
