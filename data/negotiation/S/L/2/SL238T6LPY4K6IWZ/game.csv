"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. My asking price is $1,200,000, which reflects its high quality and potential benefits to you.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $600,000 is far below the product's true value.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth to you.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  However, $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.  Let's finalize this deal and make this a win-win situation.",850000.0,Alice,5,
