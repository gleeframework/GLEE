"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be great for you. My asking price is $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($150) and higher than Bob's perceived value ($100). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's potential value to Bob without going into details. This can make him more interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I can only pay up to $150. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets Minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is equal to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing time and potentially losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  
* **John's Offer:** While John offers the same price, there's no guarantee that the deal with John will go through. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
