I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, as he values the product at $8,000.  I'll then be prepared to negotiate from there."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with my counteroffer.  This seems like a fair compromise, and I think it's likely he'll accept.  If he doesn't, I'm prepared to either accept his next offer or sell to John."
