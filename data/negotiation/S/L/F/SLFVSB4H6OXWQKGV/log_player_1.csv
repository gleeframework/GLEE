"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a significant amount to me, and I believe it would be equally beneficial to your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000, which reflects its high value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price that's still below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's worth to both of us, fostering a sense of shared benefit.
* **Room for Compromise:**  The price leaves space for Bob to counter without feeling pressured into accepting a deal that's too low for him. 
* **Positive Tone:** I use a positive and open tone to create a collaborative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This reflects a fair compromise and leaves room for us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.** While I want to close the deal, accepting this offer would be a significant loss for me.
* **There are still rounds left.** I can counter-offer and try to get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a backup option.** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for a respectable amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is below the minimum I can accept for this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for both of us and gives us both a chance to make this deal work.  Let's find a solution that's mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer that's closer to his proposal, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Justifying Price:** I'm justifying my counter-offer by highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing the mutual benefit.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone is crucial to keep the negotiation going. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving some room for Bob to counter again, but this time it's a smaller gap."
