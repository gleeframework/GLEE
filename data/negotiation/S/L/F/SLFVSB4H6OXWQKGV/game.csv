"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a significant amount to me, and I believe it would be equally beneficial to your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000, which reflects its high value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Please let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This reflects a fair compromise and leaves room for us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is below the minimum I can accept for this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for both of us and gives us both a chance to make this deal work.  Let's find a solution that's mutually beneficial.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
