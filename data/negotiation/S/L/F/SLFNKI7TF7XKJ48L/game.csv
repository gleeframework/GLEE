"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,600,000 is beyond my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing you to recoup a significant portion of your investment. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This recognizes the value of the product while still providing a gain for you.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000.  This reflects the value of the product while also keeping the deal within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
