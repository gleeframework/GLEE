"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me.  Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product offers tremendous value, and I'm confident it will bring you a strong return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still constrained by my budget.  Let's try $900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to secure the product without exceeding my limits.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we settle at $975,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true value of the product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $975,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more wiggle room.  Let's try $925,000. It's a reasonable midpoint between our current positions, and I believe it will allow us both to be happy with the outcome.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product. Let's find that sweet spot â€“ how about $960,000?  This keeps us moving forward and reflects the significant benefits you'll gain.",960000.0,Alice,7,
