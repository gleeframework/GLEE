Alice is still offering a price above my budget. With only a few rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't be able to reach an agreement. To avoid the risk of losing the opportunity to purchase the product altogether, I will buy from John for $10,000.  While this is my maximum budget, it ensures I acquire the product within my price range and avoid further negotiation."
