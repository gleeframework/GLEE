Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **Is above your minimum:** It ensures you make a profit above your $100 minimum. 
* **Is a fair price:**  It's a reasonable price considering the product's value to Bob.

This strategy balances your desire to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob interested in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it's close enough to my initial offer that it's likely the best deal I'll get.  Accepting his offer maximizes my profit in this round."
