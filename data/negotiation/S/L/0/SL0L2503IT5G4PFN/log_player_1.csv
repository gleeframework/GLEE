Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a decent margin above my minimum value of $100. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for me.  I'm curious to see if he finds this price acceptable or if he'll counter with a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  I believe there's still some potential for a higher price, especially since Bob was initially willing to consider $150. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $125. This is a compromise, lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this will incentivize him to come up a bit from his $100 offer and we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is simply too low. I'm not willing to go that far below my minimum price.  While I could continue to negotiate, I don't want to risk losing too much time and ultimately end up selling to John for $100 anyway.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $100 from John."
