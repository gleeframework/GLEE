"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $130 to start. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) to leave room for negotiation. This maximizes potential profit.
* **Polite and Positive:** The tone is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, encouraging a positive response.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""to start"" signals that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I know the product is worth significantly more to him. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal than $100. I'm willing to counter-offer to try and meet in the middle.
* **John is a backup:** I'll keep John as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't progress favorably in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate by making a significant move from my initial offer.
* **Aim for a Win-Win:**  $115 is a fair compromise, giving me a decent profit while still offering Bob a good deal compared to his perceived value of $150.
* **Maintain a Firm Stance:** While moving closer to his offer, I'm not accepting a price too close to my minimum. This shows I value the product and am serious about getting a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $105?  That's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** While not ideal, $105 is still a profit of $5 over my minimum and a significant amount more than John's offer. 
* **Bob's Concessions:** Bob has increased his offer twice, suggesting he is genuinely interested in the product.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly higher price, but there's also the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good profit."
