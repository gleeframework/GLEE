"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My starting price is $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is fantastic, but $1,400,000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,300,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a lower price. It's best to accept his offer and secure the sale."
