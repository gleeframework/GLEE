Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know if you're interested in proceeding."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification for price:** The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the high price without revealing your minimum acceptable amount. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" aim to make the offer more enticing and encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more strategic.
* **Negotiation skills:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters, but always keep your bottom line ($1,200,000) in mind."
