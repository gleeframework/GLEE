"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $105, which is a great compromise considering the product's value. It's a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,5,
