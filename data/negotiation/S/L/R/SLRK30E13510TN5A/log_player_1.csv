Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget considerations, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $13,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently been unwilling to meet above $13,500. It's unlikely he'll suddenly jump to a price that's acceptable to you.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000.  At this point, it's more profitable to take the sure thing rather than risk getting stuck in further negotiations with Bob."
