"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget considerations, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $13,500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference again and settle on $14,250?",14250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,6,
