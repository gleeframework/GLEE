"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $105 for the product, as I know it's worth $100 to you. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $10. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $110. That way, we both get a good deal and we can close this quickly.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $110, which would be $112.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $2.50. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, $112.50 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay. I'm firm on my offer of $110. I'm ready to close the deal at that price.  What do you say?",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on $110, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $113. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $3. What do you think?",113.0,Alice,7,
