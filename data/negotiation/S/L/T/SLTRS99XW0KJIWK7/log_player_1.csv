"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's still early in the negotiation. I'm willing to continue exploring possibilities and see if I can get closer to my target. Selling to John for $10,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $8,200 is a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal, $8,200 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get Bob closer to my price point.  Selling to John is always a fallback option, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,200 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,750. This is a significant drop from my original price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,750, but I'm still a bit above my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. Bob's offer of $8,500 is still a significant drop from my initial price, but it's also significantly closer to my desired outcome than selling to John for $10,000.  I'm confident that I can find a better deal with another buyer in the future, but at this point, I'd rather secure a sale and move on."
