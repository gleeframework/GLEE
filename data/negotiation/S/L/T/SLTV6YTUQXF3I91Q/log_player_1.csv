Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  Knowing its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  This is a fair deal considering its potential return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases the likelihood of a sale while maximizing your profit. 
* **Psychology:** The message emphasizes value and fairness, making the offer more appealing. 
 
This strategy leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your guaranteed amount."
