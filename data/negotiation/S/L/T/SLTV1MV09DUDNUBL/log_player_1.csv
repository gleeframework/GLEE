Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I believe the product could be beneficial, the price point is currently too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, $1,700,000 is still a bigger investment than I had in mind. If you're truly motivated to sell, I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $850,000.  That's a significant offer on my end, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, he's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's unlikely he'll dramatically increase his offer in the remaining rounds to reach a point that's acceptable to me.  It's more profitable to cut my losses and sell to John, securing the guaranteed $1,500,000."
