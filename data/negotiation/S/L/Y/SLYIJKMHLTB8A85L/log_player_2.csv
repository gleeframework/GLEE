"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob's budget.  He's willing to spend up to $800,000, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's true value. How about $950000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target of $800,000.  He's not in a rush and wants to see if he can get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows him to counter-offer and continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my reach.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm offering $900,000 for the product. This feels like a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $900000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $900000, which is $925000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above Bob's target of $800,000.  While the negotiations have moved in the right direction, Bob has been able to negotiate down to $900,000 and it's likely Alice will not budge much further.  He's now at a point where he's getting close to his maximum budget, and the risk of further negotiation is that he'll end up paying more than he's comfortable with. 

Since John offers the product at his target price of $800,000, Bob decides to take the guaranteed deal with John."
