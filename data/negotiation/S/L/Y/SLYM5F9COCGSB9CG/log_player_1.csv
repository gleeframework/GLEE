**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his initial lowball offer.  While he *might* go slightly higher, it's very unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Taking the guaranteed $10,000 from John avoids the risk of Bob's lowballing and the time pressure of further negotiation."
