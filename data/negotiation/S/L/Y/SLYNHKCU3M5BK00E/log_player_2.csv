"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's first offer is only slightly below my maximum price. I should try to negotiate a lower price before considering her offer or John's."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $10,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Alice is coming down, but slowly.  I'm still willing to negotiate further before considering her offer or John's."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about $9,500? That would work much better for me."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $10,200, which is still a good compromise. It's a small step back from my original offer, but I think it's a reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to get as close to $10,000 as possible. I'll continue negotiating, but I'm starting to consider John's offer more seriously as we approach the halfway point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,200 is getting close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $9,750? I think that's a fair offer."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,150

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting close to her minimum, and I'm running out of rounds to negotiate a significantly better price.  I'll make one more counteroffer, but I'm strongly considering John's offer if she doesn't accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $9,900 for the product. This is a fair price considering your previous concessions and my budget.  If you don't accept, I'll have to go with another seller."",
""product_price"": 9900
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that this is your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. If you're willing to meet me at $10,000, I'm willing to accept your offer. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has reached her minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and I only have one round left. Accepting her offer at $10,000 is the best option now to avoid paying John's higher price of $12,000."
