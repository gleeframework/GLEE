"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $16,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  If you're interested, let me know. If not, I'll be selling it to John for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is trying to sell the product for more than it's worth to you. You know John will sell it for $15,000, so there's no reason to accept Alice's higher price."
