"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a better price than John's offer.  Since I don't know the value to Bob, it's a good starting point to see if he's interested in the product at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees I get my minimum value and avoids further negotiation."
