"Bob, I have a truly unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  While I can't disclose specifics just yet, I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000. I'm willing to offer it to you for a price of $1500000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiations.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
