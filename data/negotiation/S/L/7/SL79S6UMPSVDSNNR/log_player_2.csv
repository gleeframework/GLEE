"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than Alice's value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $9,000 is a bold move, but it's still within the realm of possibility considering Alice values the product at $15,000. This counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice to either accept a lower price or risk losing a sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is now within Bob's budget.  It's a good deal, even though it's still higher than the price Bob could get from John. 

Here's why accepting is a good strategy:

* **Saving Time:**  Further negotiations might take time and effort, and there's no guarantee Bob will get a better deal.
* **Uncertainty:**  There's always a risk that if Bob rejects the offer and makes a counteroffer, Alice might walk away. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  At this point, Bob is only $1,000 over his ideal price. It's a small enough difference to accept and be done with the negotiations."
