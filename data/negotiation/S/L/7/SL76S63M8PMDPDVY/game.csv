"I understand that $175 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a compromise at $125. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  To be honest,  $125 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $110, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,5,
