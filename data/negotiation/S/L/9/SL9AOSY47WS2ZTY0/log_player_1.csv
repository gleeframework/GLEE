Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $150. It's a great deal on a product I know you'll love."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $100, I want to see if Bob will pay a premium.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I start high at $150, there's room for Bob to negotiate down if he finds the price too steep. 
* **Confident Presentation:**  I want to present the offer with confidence, highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to accept."
