"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a good price, and I get a quick sale. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a significant profit while staying within my spending limit.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise a bit further and come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
