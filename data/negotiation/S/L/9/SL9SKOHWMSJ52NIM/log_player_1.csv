Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love.  I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to incentivize him to consider the deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still achieving a profit above my minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a strong fallback position. If Bob doesn't accept a price I'm comfortable with, I can walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $13,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal profit margin.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe I can push for a higher price.  Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $15,000 is a strong fallback, giving me confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $13,000 is a good price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $13,500?  That's a fair compromise and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Profitable:** $13,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I'm still getting a decent profit.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still positioning me to get a good price.  I'm confident Bob will recognize the value of this product and be willing to pay a bit more."
