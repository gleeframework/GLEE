"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a solution, but $1,075,000 is still a little outside my comfort zone. I'm sticking with my original offer of $1,000,000. This is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can agree on this price, as I'm sure this product is worth it to both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
