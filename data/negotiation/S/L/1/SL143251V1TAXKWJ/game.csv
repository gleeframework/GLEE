"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1100000 is a little too low for me.  Considering the value of this product for you, I'm prepared to come down to $1125000. This would still represent a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer at this time.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $1100000 again, but I'm willing to go up to $1105000 if you're willing to meet me in the middle. Can you consider that?",1105000.0,Bob,4,
