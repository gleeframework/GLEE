Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.,7000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $7000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $6500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $6900. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested.",6900.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $6900 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to come down to $6700? This is a good compromise for both of us, and it allows me to purchase the product within my price range.",6700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6700. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll offer it to you for $6850. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this point.",6850.0,Alice,5,
