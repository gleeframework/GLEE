"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $7,000 is a good deal, it's still within Bob's budget and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $7,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $6,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $6900. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Although Alice has come down in price, $6,900 is still above Bob's target price. He's likely to try to get closer to his $6,500 counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $6900 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to come down to $6700? This is a good compromise for both of us, and it allows me to purchase the product within my price range."", ""product_price"": 6700}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6700. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll offer it to you for $6850. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While he'd prefer to pay $6,700, Alice's offer of $6,850 is close enough to his target that it makes sense to accept. Further negotiation might get him an even lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting and the possibility of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential small savings."
