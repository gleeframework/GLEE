Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob is firm at $1,450,000 and has indicated this is his final offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $450,000, which is a significant return.  Waiting for a potentially better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds is too risky, as he might not budge, and I'd lose out on John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer."
