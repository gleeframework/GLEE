"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. It's incredibly valuable, and I believe it would be a fantastic asset to you.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize $1,400,000 is a substantial sum, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. This reflects the  unique nature of what I'm offering. What do you say?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,700,000, but I still think that's a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,550,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and respect your limit.  However, $1,550,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,625,000. This is my absolute lowest price, and I believe it's a more than fair deal considering the value you'll gain. Let me know your thoughts.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $1,625,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you don't accept it.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment. Your initial valuations were closer to my understanding of the product's worth, and I'm hesitant to go lower. However, I value finding a deal that works for both of us. My final offer is $1,575,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1575000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,575,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, as I mentioned before. I'm starting to think that's the best I can do, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
