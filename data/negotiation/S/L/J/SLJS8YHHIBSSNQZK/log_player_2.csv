"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at a starting price of $22,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $22,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm looking for. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $18,000 is still too high.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $18,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations is still quite large.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, but that's my absolute floor. It's a significant discount and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above my budget. While I could continue to negotiate,  I'm running out of rounds.  To avoid the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer or running out of time, I'm going to secure the product from John for $8,000. This guarantees I get the product within my budget."
