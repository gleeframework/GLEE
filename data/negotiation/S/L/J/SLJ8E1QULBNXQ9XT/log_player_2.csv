# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to walk away if we can't reach an agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1025000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the minimum price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what you're willing to pay. However, it's much closer to your budget. You should continue negotiating to see if you can get a better deal. You can likely bring the price down even further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $980000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. At this point, you have a good chance of getting the product from John for $1,000,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice, as the price is unlikely to drop much further, and you could end up paying more than you want."
