"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe it's a bit pricey at $11,500, and I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a good deal for both of us and ensures we can finalize this transaction quickly.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. I'd like to try to get closer to my initial target of $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? It's still a good compromise for both of us, and I'm willing to commit to the purchase if we can agree on this price.",10750.0,Bob,4,
