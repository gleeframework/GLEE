"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm putting on this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product, which is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's reach an agreement and avoid going back and forth any further. ",875000.0,Bob,4,
