Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $8,000 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or potentially John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,250 is closer to my target, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,250 is still a bit low.  How about we settle on $9,750?  This price is a fair compromise, and I think it reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,500.  That's a fair price, and I'm eager to get my hands on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is getting close to what I'm hoping for, I'm still within range of getting a better price from Bob or John. I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down to $9,600. This is a very fair price, and it allows us to both get what we want. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9600}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you $9,550.  Take it or leave it - this is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,550
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob's final offer of $9,550 is still below my minimum target price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that I'll run out of rounds without reaching a satisfactory price.  John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which is more than enough for me to secure a good deal."
