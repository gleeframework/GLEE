"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $850,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I can meet you halfway, though. My revised offer is $750,000, which is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. That's closer, but I'm aiming for something around $700,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're getting closer to my target, but I still think $700,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than that. My revised offer is $725,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $725,000 is close, but to be honest, I have another offer at a very competitive price.  I'd be willing to close the deal with you right now at $710,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have another offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $710,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need $720,000 to feel comfortable with the deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time.",720000.0,Alice,7,
