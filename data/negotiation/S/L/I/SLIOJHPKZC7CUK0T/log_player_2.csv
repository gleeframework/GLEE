"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is less than the $15,000 John is asking, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  There's a good chance Alice will accept a price closer to her $12,000 valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,500. This is a good price for Bob as it's still below his maximum budget of $15,000 and closer to his desired price. There is a risk in rejecting and making another counteroffer, as Alice may not budge further, and Bob would then have to buy from John at a higher price.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
