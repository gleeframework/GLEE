"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her ($1,100,000 vs $1,200,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential, I'm not ready to commit to $1,100,000 at this point.  I'd be interested in exploring a price closer to $1,000,000. This would allow for a more comfortable margin for me and hopefully still be a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a significant value to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value while also being more palatable for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, and $1,050,000 is a good price for you, saving you $450,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or increase the price.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation."
