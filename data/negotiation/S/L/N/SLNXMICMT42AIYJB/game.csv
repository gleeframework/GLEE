"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential, I'm not ready to commit to $1,100,000 at this point.  I'd be interested in exploring a price closer to $1,000,000. This would allow for a more comfortable margin for me and hopefully still be a good deal for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a significant value to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value while also being more palatable for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
