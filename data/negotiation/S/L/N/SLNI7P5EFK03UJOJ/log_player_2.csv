It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price.  You can always buy from John if you can't reach a deal with Alice."

Alice's offer:

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but it's still above your budget. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can bridge the gap."

Alice's offer:

Alice is sticking to her price and it seems like further negotiation won't get you closer to your desired price. You have a guaranteed deal with John for $10,000, so it's the best option to avoid further haggling."
