"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000?  That gives you a good deal and keeps me closer to my target price.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets me closer to my budget. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
