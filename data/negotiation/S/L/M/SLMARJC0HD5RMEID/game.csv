"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $850,000 at this time.  This price reflects my current financial situation and my desire to make this deal work.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $850,000 is significantly below the product's value and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 to facilitate this deal.  This price still leaves room for a profitable outcome for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. I believe it's a good starting point for finding a mutually beneficial solution. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

To make this deal work, I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. This price reflects both the product's worth and your financial situation.  I'm open to discussing further if you have any concerns.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
