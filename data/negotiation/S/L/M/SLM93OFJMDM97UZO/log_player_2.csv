**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $1,500,000 is the optimal strategy.  You'll still get the product, but at a higher price."
