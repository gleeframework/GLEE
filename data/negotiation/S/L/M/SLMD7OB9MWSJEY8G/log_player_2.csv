"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and still allows for a healthy profit for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While your offer is tempting, I believe it undervalues some of the key benefits it offers.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your initial counteroffer of $1,000,000, but it's within your budget of $1,500,000 and significantly lower than her first offer of $1,300,000.  It's a good compromise that saves you money compared to buying from John."
