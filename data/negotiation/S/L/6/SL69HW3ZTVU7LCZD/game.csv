"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1000000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1000000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $900000, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price. I can offer it to you for $950000. It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $925000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but I need to make a bit more than that. I can offer it to you for $975000. It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it considering the value of the product.",975000.0,Alice,7,
