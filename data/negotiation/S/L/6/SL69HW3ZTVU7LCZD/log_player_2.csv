{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's a good starting point to negotiate, and there's a high chance Alice will be willing to lower the price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1000000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above my budget, but it's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. I will reject the offer and try to get closer to my target price of $800,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $900000, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price. I can offer it to you for $950000. It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $925,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but I need to make a bit more than that. I can offer it to you for $975000. It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $975,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. I've already spent several rounds trying to negotiate, and it seems unlikely that Alice will come down much further.  Therefore, it makes more sense to buy the product from John for my target price of $800,000."
