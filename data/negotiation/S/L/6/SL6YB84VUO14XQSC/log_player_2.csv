"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe could be extremely valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1200000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision as soon as possible.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point, meaning you won't save any money by buying from her. Since John is also offering the product for the same price, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John. This opens the possibility of negotiating with Alice further or exploring other options in the future."
