Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have John as a backup buyer at $12,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you can take a slightly riskier approach with Bob. The goal is to see if you can get more than $12,000, but you don't want to scare him away with an unreasonable price.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its unique value, I'm asking for $13,500. I believe it's a fair price considering what it offers. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** Starting with ""I'm excited..."" sets a positive tone.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique value"" subtly reinforces that the price isn't arbitrary.
* **Strong Price:** $13,500 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's instantly off the table.
* **Open to Discussion:** ""Let me know what you think!"" invites Bob to counter-offer and keeps the negotiation going.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might lower your asking price slightly.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a smaller markup.

**Outcome**

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts your offer, and you make a profit above your minimum.
* **Acceptable Case:** Bob negotiates down, but you still settle above $12,000.
* **Worst Case:** Bob rejects the offer, and you sell to John at your guaranteed price."
