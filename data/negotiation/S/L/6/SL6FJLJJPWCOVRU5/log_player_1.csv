"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the midpoint between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly emphasizing the product's value to Bob without revealing my minimum. 

This offer aims to establish a good starting point for negotiations while leaving space to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $100.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum, but it's not ideal.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe there's room for a higher offer, especially since Bob clearly values the product at $150.
* **Avoiding Settling:** I'm not ready to settle for $100, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price, potentially reaching a more favorable outcome. Selling to John at this point would be a less profitable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good price.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm again subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm using positive language (""Let's meet in the middle and close this deal"") to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

This counteroffer is designed to bridge the gap between our positions and increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement in this round."
