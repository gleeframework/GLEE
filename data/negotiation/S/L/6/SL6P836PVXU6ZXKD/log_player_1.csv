Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer a price significantly lower than my minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting me closer to my goal. 
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
