"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My initial price is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm also being friendly and trying to build rapport to encourage him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I can offer $75 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's significantly below my minimum price and even lower than what it's worth to him. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $75 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $112.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $112.5 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by counteroffering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $112.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise - I'm willing to go down to $137.50. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 137.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left and can likely get a higher price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125, but I'm not willing to go lower than that.  I'm sure you'll agree that this product is worth every penny.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. With only two rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a price higher than $150 from Bob, and I'm confident I can close the deal with John.  It's better to lock in a guaranteed profit than risk getting stuck with a lower offer."
