"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your price point, $1400000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to negotiate further. Let's meet in the middle. I'd be willing to accept $1750000 for the product. This would ensure both of us have a fair deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $1600000 is still not quite right for me. I understand the value of this product is different for each of us, but I'm confident it's a great investment for you. As a final compromise, I'm willing to sell it for $1550000. This is a significant price drop from my original offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
