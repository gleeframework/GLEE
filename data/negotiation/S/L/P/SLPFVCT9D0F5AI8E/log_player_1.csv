Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be happy to sell it for $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering the product at $10,000,  we can gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, we know we could have potentially gone even higher. If he rejects, we have the security of John's offer. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While we want to maximize profit, we also want to propose a price that Bob might consider reasonable, given that he values the product at $8,000."
