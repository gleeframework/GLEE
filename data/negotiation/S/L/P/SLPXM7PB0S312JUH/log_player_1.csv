Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate it. However, $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $120?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
