Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $12,000, Alice aims for a price slightly below that to maximize her profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $11,500 is a strong starting point, it leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Deal:**  Alice understands the importance of closing a deal quickly. Offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value increases the likelihood of acceptance, avoiding the need to settle for John's lower offer."
