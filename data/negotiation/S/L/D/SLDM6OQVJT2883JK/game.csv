"Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your interest, $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the product's unique value and provides a solid return for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
