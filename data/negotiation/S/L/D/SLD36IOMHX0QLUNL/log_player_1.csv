Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you making a move. However, $6,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. Could you do $10,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```
This is a good point to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **You're exceeding his perceived value:** Bob is offering $8,000, which is the maximum value he places on the product.
* **You're above your minimum:** While you could get $10,000 from John, accepting $8,000 now avoids the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing Bob as a buyer.

Taking a slightly lower price for a guaranteed sale is often better than holding out for an ideal scenario that might not materialize.
