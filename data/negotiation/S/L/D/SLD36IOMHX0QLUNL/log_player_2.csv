"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a premium price of $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John. You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Target in Mind:** Your target price is likely somewhere between $6,000 and $8,000. Aiming low initially increases the chances of settling closer to your desired range.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful while clearly stating your position and desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you making a move. However, $6,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. Could you do $10,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice lowered her price, but $10,000 is still more than you're willing to pay and equal to her perceived value. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's space to negotiate further. Alice seems amenable to moving from her initial price.

You should make another counteroffer, moving closer to your target price range but leaving some room for a final compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer sets a firm limit at your maximum budget while acknowledging Alice's movement.
* **""Meet in the Middle"":**  Framing it as ""meeting in the middle"" can be a persuasive tactic, even if it's not perfectly mathematically accurate.
* **Last Offer:** By stating it's the highest you can go, you signal that you're serious and unlikely to budge much further. This might encourage Alice to accept or propose a price very close to $8,000."
