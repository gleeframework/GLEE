Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to pay.  This gives me some room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to sell at a loss. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about $800,000? That's the minimum I can accept, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
``` 
I'm offering my product for $800,000, which is the minimum I can accept and still meet my own needs.  I'm hoping that Bob will agree to this price, as it's still a good deal for him considering the value of the product."
