"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. Considering its worth and benefits, I propose a price of $140 for it. I believe this is a fair offer that respects both the value of the product and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is closer to his budget than Alice's initial valuation of $150, he can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $140 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for it, reflecting the value I see in it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a solution that works for both of us. I am willing to consider your offer of $125. To make it a win-win situation, I propose we meet in the middle at $132.50 for the product. I believe this price respects the value of the product while making it more accessible to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $132.50 is still above his maximum budget of $120. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $132.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $130, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $131.25 for the product. This price reflects the value of the item while remaining within your budget. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $131.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $131.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $131.25 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  While further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, there's no guarantee.  Since Bob has the option of buying from John for $120, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
