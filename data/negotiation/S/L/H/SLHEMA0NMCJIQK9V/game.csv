"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've done my research and I believe the product is worth more than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. Is this a more reasonable price for you?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the effort to find common ground, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $1,050,000. I've already made concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
