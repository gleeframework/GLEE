Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to save a bit more. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $8,750. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further or the negotiation stalling completely."
