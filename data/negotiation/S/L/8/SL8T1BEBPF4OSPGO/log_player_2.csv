"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,750,000. This is a significant difference, and Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,600,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's make this deal happen.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While the price is still higher than Bob's ideal, it's closer to his maximum threshold and  represents a significant compromise from Alice's initial offer.  It's also a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000."
