"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $10,000 is a bit too low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $11,500? That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to negotiate, Bob. However, $11,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I could meet you at $12,500. This would be a good deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"You're getting closer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
