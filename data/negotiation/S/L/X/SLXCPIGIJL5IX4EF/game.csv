"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to offer $1200000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1350000. This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
