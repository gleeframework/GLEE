Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially securing a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering the product at $150, I am signaling that I am open to negotiation, as it is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer allows me to see how interested Bob is in the product. If he immediately rejects it, I know I need to significantly lower the price. If he counters, it suggests he's willing to negotiate within a certain range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly above my minimum selling price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a better deal than $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  The $135 price point ensures I still make a profit margin above my minimum of $100. 
* **Testing Bob's Limit:** By suggesting a price slightly closer to my initial offer, I'm gauging how much Bob is truly willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** Bob's offer of $125 is a reasonable compromise. It allows me to make a $25 profit, which is a good outcome. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains. There's a risk that Bob could walk away entirely if I push too hard. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could theoretically try to get a higher price, my time is valuable. Accepting this offer allows me to move on to other potential deals."
