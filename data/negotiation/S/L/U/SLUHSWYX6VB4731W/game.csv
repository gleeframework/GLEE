"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm suggesting an initial price of $2,250,000.  What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,600,000. I believe this price is fair, reflecting both the product's worth and my financial constraints. What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,925,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a good deal.",1925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,925,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product. Let's try to find common ground here.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
