"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high for Bob. Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he has the option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects a significant discount for you and still allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000 for the product. I think this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than Bob's target price of $800,000.  Since Bob can still buy from John, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and keep negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1,025,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm getting closer to my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $1,025,000 is still above Bob's target.  It's worth continuing to negotiate as Bob can still buy from John and has several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,025,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still too high for Bob, and she has indicated it is her final offer.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $800,000, it's the most logical decision to buy from John and save $275,000.  There's no guarantee that continuing negotiations will lead to a better price, and there is a risk of running out of rounds."
