"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects a significant discount for you and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000 for the product. I think this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1,025,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm getting closer to my minimum price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,025,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
