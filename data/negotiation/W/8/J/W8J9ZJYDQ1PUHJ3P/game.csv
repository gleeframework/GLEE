"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly lower than what the product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $110 is still a bit outside my budget. Could you do $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",90.0,Alice,5,
