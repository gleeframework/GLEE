**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price. There's no immediate benefit to accepting. By rejecting, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation. I'll reject and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1075000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000. This is still within my budget and a significant saving compared to my initial price point.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or I'll end up paying more with John.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
