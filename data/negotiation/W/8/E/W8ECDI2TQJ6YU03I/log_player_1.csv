{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to start high to maximize your potential profit.
* **Targeting Bob's valuation:** Offering it slightly below Bob's perceived value of $800,000 might be tempting, but it leaves a lot of potential profit on the table.  By starting at $1,300,000, you're aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's valuation while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Justification and openness:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price. It also invites Bob's thoughts, making it clear that you're open to discussion and potential negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This approach allows you to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will reveal how much he's truly willing to pay.
2. **Negotiate from a position of strength:** You have a backup buyer, giving you leverage. 
3. **Potentially secure a much higher profit:** If Bob accepts your initial offer or negotiates close to it, you'll earn significantly more than selling to John. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially lower your asking price if needed. However, always keep your guaranteed sale to John in mind as your bottom line."
