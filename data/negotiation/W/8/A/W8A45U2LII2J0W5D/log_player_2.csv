While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better price.  You should reject the offer and make a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price.  While John's offer is a safe option, it's always good to try to negotiate and potentially get a better deal with Alice."
