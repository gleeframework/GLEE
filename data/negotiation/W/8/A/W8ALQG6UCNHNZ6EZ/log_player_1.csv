Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value we've discussed.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is moving in the right direction, the negotiations are progressing too slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point close enough to my minimum in a reasonable timeframe. Selling to John ensures I receive the full value I place on the product."
