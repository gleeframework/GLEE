"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's closer to my value but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy might cause Bob to immediately reject, but it sets a high bar and gives me room to come down later if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $15,000 with further negotiation.  This gives me a better chance to get a higher price without resorting to selling to John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm countering with my desired price of $15,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it's still within a reasonable range for Bob considering his value of $12,000. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer $15,000, $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum value and it's likely we won't get much closer.  I'm choosing to secure the sale rather than risk losing the deal and needing to sell to John for $15,000."
