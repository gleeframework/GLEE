Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Its value to you is significant, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  I'm starting with an offer of $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its worth to you. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's significantly lower than my minimum goal of $1,000,000. It's worth exploring further negotiation with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest and allows me to meet my minimum goal.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has offered my minimum goal of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price,  accepting this offer ensures I meet my minimum goal and avoid further negotiation. There's no guarantee that further rounds will lead to a better price, and I risk losing the deal entirely."
