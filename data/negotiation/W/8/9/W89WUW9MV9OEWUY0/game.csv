"Hi Bob, I have a product I'm selling that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500.  This is a great deal for you, as it's worth the same amount to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay full price.",8500.0,Alice,1,
