**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly very attached to a price close to $1 million.  She's unlikely to budge much further, especially since she mentioned considering other options. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially ending up with a worse deal or missing out entirely.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price point."
