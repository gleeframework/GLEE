"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with him. I am confident that I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. It's worth significantly more to you than that. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,100,000? That's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a better deal.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get him closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still not close to what this product is worth to you. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While I'm still hopeful I can get a better price than $1,000,000 from Bob, we're running out of time, and there's no guarantee that Bob will budge any further. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that."
