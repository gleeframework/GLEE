"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This still reflects the product's worth to me while keeping the cost within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still unable to meet you at $1,900,000 given my budget constraints. I would like to make one final counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this price respects the product's value while staying within my financial limits.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
