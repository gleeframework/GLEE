"Alice,  $1,600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while still leaving room for some negotiation. ",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this negotiation. While $1,100,000 is a starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential this product holds. To move things forward, I propose a price of $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,450,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend right now. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still giving us both a good deal. ",1250000.0,Bob,4,
