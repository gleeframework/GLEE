Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting a bit more. I can do $115, but that's my final offer. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has signaled it's her final offer. While it's above my ideal price, getting it for $115 is a reasonable compromise and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
