"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming high to maximize potential profit.  $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying significantly above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer helps us understand Bob's eagerness and flexibility. His response will guide our next move.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value while inviting a counteroffer, setting a collaborative tone.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Could we work something closer to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good profit, we have room to negotiate.  Bob's message indicates strong interest, and his offer is significantly closer to our initial ask than his perceived value of $1,500,000. This suggests he's willing to go higher. 

We're still in the early stages, so rejecting and providing a counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a potentially better outcome. We'll aim to meet him somewhere in the middle while staying above our minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is a significant step down from its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This recognizes its worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** We're signaling willingness to negotiate by moving significantly closer to Bob's offer. However, the $175,000 increase keeps us firmly above our minimum and aims for a strong profit margin.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""true value,"" we subtly remind Bob of the product's worth and his potential gain.
* **Positive Framing:** ""Meet in the middle"" promotes a sense of fairness and collaboration, encouraging Bob to accept or counter with a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $1,050,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is tempting, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's consistent increments and positive language suggest he has room to go higher. By rejecting and countering, we maintain pressure while demonstrating we're not settling for a lowball offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, how about we settle on $1,125,000? This reflects a substantial concession on my part while still recognizing the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're reducing our increment to $50,000, signaling we're nearing our bottom line while still aiming higher than Bob's offer.
* **Appreciation & Urgency:**  Phrases like ""drive a hard bargain"" and ""serious about closing"" inject a sense of respect and urgency, encouraging a quicker resolution.
* **Value Reminder:** We reiterate the product's value to justify our position without being overly aggressive. 

We're testing Bob's flexibility. If he rejects this, we'll need to carefully consider our next move, potentially shifting towards accepting a figure closer to $1,100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still very interested but we need to get this price down a bit further. Would you consider $1,080,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but we're going to push a little further.  Bob is clearly interested and still incrementing his offers, even if they are smaller now. We're only $280,000 above our absolute minimum, and he's potentially willing to go over $1,100,000.

We'll use our next counteroffer to signal a firm stance while leaving a small window for a final push from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been flexible throughout this process because I see the value this product brings you.  My final offer is $1,100,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** By stating ""final offer,"" we establish a strong stance, indicating we won't go lower. However, the message remains respectful and emphasizes the mutual benefits of the deal.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We meet Bob in the middle of the previous offers, showing willingness to compromise while staying above our absolute minimum. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, the ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make his best decision quickly.

Now it's up to Bob. If he rejects this offer, we'll need to seriously consider accepting his next counter (if it's reasonable) or walking away and taking John's offer to avoid missing out entirely."
