"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business.  I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential. My asking price is $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might be able to get her to lower the price closer to John's offer."
