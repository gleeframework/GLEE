Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and my other interested buyers, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $11,999 as possible, but any price above $12,000 would be illogical for Bob.
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers, Alice encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $11,500, there might be a slight margin for negotiation if Bob counters.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing Alice's potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
