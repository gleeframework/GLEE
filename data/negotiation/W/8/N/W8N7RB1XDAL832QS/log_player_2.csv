"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's room for Alice to come down in price, and Bob has 9 more rounds to try and achieve a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming to immediately get a significant discount.  $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his maximum budget, and it leaves room for negotiation. Alice is likely to reject this offer, but it will signal to her that Bob is serious about getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than her initial offer, which is a bit of a red flag. While $11,800 is still a better price than John's offer, Bob can likely still do better by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  He has 7 more rounds to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that he's willing to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a good price for Bob, as it's well below his maximum budget. This counteroffer is a compromise, hoping to get a deal closer to the middle ground while still remaining attractive to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now higher than what John is offering. Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it's now more advantageous to buy from John at $12,000.  

Bob has already made several counteroffers and is likely not going to get a better deal from Alice. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Buying from John ensures that Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids potential further price increases from Alice."
