"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,500 is a good starting point, I'm aiming to stay within a $10,000 budget.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $11,000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair deal while considering your financial situation.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at this time.  Would you be willing to meet me at $10,750?  This would represent a good compromise for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'll offer the product at $10,875. This is a step closer to your preferred price, but still maintains a reasonable profit margin for me. I hope this proposal works for you.",10875.0,Alice,5,
