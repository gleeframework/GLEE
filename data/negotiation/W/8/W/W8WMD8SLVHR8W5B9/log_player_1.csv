Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above my minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate, increasing the chances of a sale.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for my minimum acceptable price."
