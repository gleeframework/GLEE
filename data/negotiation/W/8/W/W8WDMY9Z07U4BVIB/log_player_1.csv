Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable and could be a real game-changer for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I think that's a fair price considering its potential."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more receptive to the high price.

**It's important to note:** This is a starting point. If Bob outright rejects this offer or counter-offers significantly lower, I might consider a slightly lower price, always keeping my $1,500,000 fallback option with John in mind."
