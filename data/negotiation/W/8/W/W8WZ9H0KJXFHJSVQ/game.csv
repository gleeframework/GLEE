"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $100, and I'm sure you'll get a lot of use out of it.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'll sell it to you for $165. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $165 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer of $120, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me at $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to pay more, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you at $160, which is a compromise that's closer to my minimum price. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value it holds for you.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $160, but I'm still not sure if that's the best deal for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $145. I'm getting a bit concerned that I might be able to find a better deal elsewhere, so I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make at least $155. I think that's a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's still a good deal for you.",155.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more compromise, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $150, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere.",150.0,Bob,8,
