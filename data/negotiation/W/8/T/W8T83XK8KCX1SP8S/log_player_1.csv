Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I'm asking for $18,000, which I believe reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Could you consider reducing the price to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $18,000 is already a competitive price for a product of this quality. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,500. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 16500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $15,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

``` 
At this point, Bob is holding firm at $15,000. It's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting his offer secures a $5,000 profit, which is a reasonable outcome.  Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate and missing out on both offers.
