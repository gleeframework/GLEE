Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** You state the price and encourage Bob to respond.

Remember, the negotiation is a game of strategy! Keep in mind Bob's value, your minimum, and the potential of selling to John while making your decisions."
