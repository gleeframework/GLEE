"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product at a price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. My initial offer is $1,100,000.  This price is still below its worth to me, but demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This would still allow you a profit while being within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,025,000, which is a fair compromise. This would still be a good profit for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal with a price that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,010,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows me to stay within my financial limits. Let's find a way to close this deal with a price that works for both of us.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
