"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, and offer the product for $1,100,000. This reflects a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
