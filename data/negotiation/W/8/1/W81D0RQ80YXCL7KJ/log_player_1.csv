Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price just below the middle point between our valuations to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. I want to maximize my profit, but also keep the negotiation open for further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $13,250.  This is a great deal for both of us, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although I'd prefer a higher price, $12,750 is significantly more than selling to John, and we're running out of rounds. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good outcome for both of us."
