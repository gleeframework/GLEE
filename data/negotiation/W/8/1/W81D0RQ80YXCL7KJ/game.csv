"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $13,250.  This is a great deal for both of us, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",12750.0,Bob,4,
