"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $700,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $700,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to consider offers closer to that mark if you're serious.  To show I'm flexible, let's try $950,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to close the deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, I think we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  Let's make this deal happen.",750000.0,Bob,6,
