Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $650,000 for the product.  What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $750,000 is closer, but still a touch high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
