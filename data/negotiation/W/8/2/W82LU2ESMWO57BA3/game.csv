"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8000 to you, and I know it's worth more than that to me.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $8500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9500.  This reflects a significant discount from my original offer and gives you a great deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I want to finalize the deal, $9000 is still not quite there for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9250?  That's a fair price that gives us both a good outcome.  Let's make it happen.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to go up to $9050, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",9050.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9050 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9150.  Let's make a deal and close this out.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both.",9150.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $8500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",8500.0,Bob,8,
