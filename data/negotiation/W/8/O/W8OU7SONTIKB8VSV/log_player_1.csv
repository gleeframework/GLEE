Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, I can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and still ensures a significant profit.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Justification:** While the message mentions ""fair reflection,"" it avoids being overly aggressive.  

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:**  Excellent! I secure a substantial profit beyond my minimum.
* **Bob negotiates:** This opens the door to finding a mutually agreeable price, still likely above $800,000.
* **Bob rejects:** No problem. I proceed with selling to John at my guaranteed price."
