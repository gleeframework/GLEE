"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you. Given its immense value, I propose a starting price of $1,300,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** I'm aiming high in the first round to establish a strong negotiating position. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling the product's value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""unique opportunity"" and ""immense value,"" I'm framing the price within a context that emphasizes the potential benefits to Bob.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I make it clear that this is a starting point and that I'm willing to hear Bob's perspective, fostering a collaborative atmosphere. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting well above both our valuations gives me leverage and allows me to potentially close a deal closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my perspective, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter to guide the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you presenting your perspective and your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge your offer, the value of this product to the right buyer is substantial. Let's find a middle ground. I propose a price of $1,150,000. I believe this reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone by recognizing his offer and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's high value to keep the price point anchored higher. 
* **Significant Concession:**  I've reduced my price by $150,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to move toward a deal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer still keeps me above my minimum but opens the door for Bob to potentially offer a price above $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go, given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my minimum acceptable price and the guaranteed offer from John. There is no strategic advantage to continuing the negotiation. Accepting now secures a successful outcome."
