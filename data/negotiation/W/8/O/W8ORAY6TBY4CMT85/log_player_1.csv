Bob's offer:

""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're still quite far apart in our valuations.  To be completely transparent, walking away with anything under $1,500,000 would mean accepting a significant loss on my end. I'm willing to consider a significantly lower offer, but it needs to be closer to that mark.  How about we try $1,650,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the product's value to you. I'm also being upfront â€“ anything over $800,000 just won't work for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 as my final offer.  I understand this is a significant reduction from your initial ask, but I believe it's a fair deal considering my financial constraints. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough one! Bob has laid his cards on the table and it's clear he won't budge further.  Let's analyze:

* **Accepting Bob's offer:** You'll get $800,000, which is a substantial loss compared to John's offer.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  Bob has presented his ""final offer,"" making further negotiation unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. You risk wasting time and potentially losing John's offer. 
* **Selling to John:** Guarantees your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

Given the circumstances, the most logical decision is to sell to John.
