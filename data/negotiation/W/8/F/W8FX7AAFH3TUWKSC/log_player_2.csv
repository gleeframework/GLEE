Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a good profit, but $13,500 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go to $13,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my target price and still allows you to make a decent profit. Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise. I'm willing to give you a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **One Round Left:** Bob is down to his final round of negotiation with Alice. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a lower price.
* **Limited Upside:**  Alice's offer of $13,250 is only slightly better than her previous offer. It's unlikely she will come down significantly further in this final round.
* **Guaranteed Price:** Buying from John for $15,000 offers certainty. While it's more expensive than Bob's desired price, it's a known value.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential for a lower price from Alice is outweighed by the risk of not reaching an agreement.  Bob needs to decide if the potential savings are worth the risk of ending up with nothing. 

**Conclusion:**  Given the limited time and potential for a better deal from John, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $15,000."
