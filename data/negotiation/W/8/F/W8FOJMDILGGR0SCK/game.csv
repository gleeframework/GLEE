"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9000 is still too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $10500, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10250. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10250.0,Bob,4,
