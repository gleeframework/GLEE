"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I have a strict budget.  Would you consider $650,000? I think that's a fair starting point for us.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm serious about buying, but I need to stick to my budget. How about $725,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm willing to move to reach a deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to move forward. However, $725,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is right on the edge for me. I can tell we're both trying to get a fair deal here.  My absolute final offer is $775,000.  If that works, we have an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm afraid $775,000 is still a bit below my target. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and explore other opportunities. I think the product would be a great fit for you, but I need to prioritize my own interests. I wish you the best in your search for a suitable alternative.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
