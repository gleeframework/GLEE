"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value to you, but I would like to propose a lower price of $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  That way we both get a good deal.",112.5,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $107.50 for the product. This still allows us to share the cost fairly while keeping the transaction within my budget.",107.5,Bob,4,
