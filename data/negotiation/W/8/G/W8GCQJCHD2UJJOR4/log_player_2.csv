Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it's still a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not convinced that $9,750 is a good price for the product, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,250. This is the last time I'll be willing to adjust the price, as I really believe it's worth more than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has indicated she won't budge further. While you could push for a slightly lower price, the difference is getting smaller and you risk her ending the negotiation. Accepting at $10,250 secures a good deal compared to John's $15,000 price."
