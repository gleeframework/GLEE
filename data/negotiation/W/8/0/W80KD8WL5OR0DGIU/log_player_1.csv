Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize the fairness of the price, even though it's above Bob's minimum. This can make Bob feel more inclined to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message also encourages Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth dialogue.

**Remember:** This is just the first step. I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and my own willingness to negotiate. The goal is to get as close to $1,250,000 as possible while still securing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $1200000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is at the minimum he's willing to pay, which is also the value of the product to him.  Since my goal is to maximize profit, accepting his offer is the best choice. 

While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I can get a higher price. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale at a price that is still very favorable."
