"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250.",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $250 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $180. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $180 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $120. If you're open to that, I'm ready to buy. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $120. I can offer you a compromise at $160. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
