"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for less than $90 from Alice, so it makes sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $90 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $87.50. It's a fair middle ground, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $87.50 is a good deal for you, as it is lower than what John is selling it for and still a decent profit for Alice. Accepting this offer saves you money compared to buying from John."
