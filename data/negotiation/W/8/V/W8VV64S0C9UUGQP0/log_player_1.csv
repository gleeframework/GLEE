Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price increases my chances of a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a price point that allows me to make a significant profit above my minimum ($150) while still being attractive to Bob, who values the product at $120. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited time"" offer, I hope to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
