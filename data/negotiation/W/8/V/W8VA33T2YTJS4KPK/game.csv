"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your offer. How about we settle on $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $7,000? That would be a great price for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
