"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,100,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  To be fair, I've put a lot into this product and $1,800,000 reflects its true value. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This offer is fair given the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
