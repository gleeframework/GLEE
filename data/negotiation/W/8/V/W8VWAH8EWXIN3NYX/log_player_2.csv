Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  To be fair, I've put a lot into this product and $1,800,000 reflects its true value. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
