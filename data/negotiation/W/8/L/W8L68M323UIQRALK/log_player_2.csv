"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $10,000, there's no immediate benefit to accepting Alice's offer. It's worth exploring if a lower price is possible.  Rejecting the offer opens the door to negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and establish a starting point for further bargaining.  A $3,000 discount is substantial, giving Alice room to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate.  He's already shown a willingness to pay close to his limit, and rejecting this offer signals that he's prepared to walk away if he doesn't get a price closer to his target. It's also worth noting that Alice's counteroffer was relatively small ($1,000 less), suggesting she might be willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  By offering $8,000, he's now within $1,000 of Alice's last offer. This counteroffer is designed to show that Bob is serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal. It leaves some room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's conceding too much."
