Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to find a good deal. While your offer is appreciated, the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value it holds while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable offer, the gap between his current offer ($950,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) is still significant. It's unlikely he'll bridge that gap quickly enough to warrant continuing the negotiation.  Selling to John ensures I get the full value I place on the product."
