"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go over $1,350,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned and my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This offer takes into account the unique benefits and potential returns this product offers.  I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,700,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,350,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to stay within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within budget, but  $1,350,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To reach a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,550,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the deal. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
