Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Open Ended:** I'm asking Bob for his thoughts to gauge his interest and potential counteroffers. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for negotiation and a possible win-win scenario with Bob."
