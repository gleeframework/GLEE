Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I believe a price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high but within reason:**  While I know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, starting at his valuation is too low. Aiming for $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauge Bob's reaction:** This first offer is as much about gathering information as it is about making a sale. Bob's response will reveal how much he values the product and how aggressively he'll negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $10,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value of $8,000, it's still considerably less than my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests there's a chance we can find a price that works for both of us. I need to push him closer to my desired outcome. 
* **John is my safety net:** Knowing I have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your budget considerations, $10,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility but hold firm:**  Coming down from $15,000 shows I'm willing to negotiate. However, proposing $12,500 keeps me above my absolute minimum and signals I'm serious about the product's worth.
* **""Meet me halfway"" framing:**  This phrasing can feel more collaborative and less adversarial to Bob. It positions the compromise as a win-win rather than a concession. 
* **Test Bob's upper limit:** This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is truly interested in negotiating or if he's anchored at a much lower price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my maximum budget. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is unlikely to budge:** His latest offer is still below my minimum, and he's explicitly stated it's his ""maximum budget."" Further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees I meet my minimum acceptable price. There's no risk of further haggling or losing the sale entirely.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob consumes time and energy that could be spent on other potential sales.  

It's been a strategic negotiation, but ultimately securing a fair price with a reliable buyer like John is the best outcome."
