"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for a product worth a lot more to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to create some negotiating room. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that the product is worth more to me, suggesting its potential value. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for potential counteroffers and further negotiation within the 10 rounds. 

**Important Note:** I'm aware that John offers a guaranteed $12,000. However, I'm prioritizing a potential deal with Bob first, as it could yield a higher profit. I'll use the remaining rounds to gauge his interest and adapt my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $11500 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my desired price and only slightly above his perceived value.  Accepting it wouldn't be profitable. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiations and potentially achieve a better price.
* **John's Offer:** While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, I'm still willing to try for a better outcome with Bob. I have 8 rounds left, which gives me time to explore a deal with Bob that might be closer to my desired $12,000.

**Next Move:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob in round 3, aiming to find a middle ground closer to my initial price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer reflects a willingness to compromise while still keeping my profit margin relatively high.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I use encouraging language to keep the negotiation open and positive.

**Strategy:** 

* By moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement.
* I'm keeping the negotiation focused on the potential value of the product rather than simply haggling over the price. 

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I will carefully consider my options in Round 4.  I'll need to assess if continuing to negotiate with Bob is worth the risk or if accepting John's offer is the better choice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. How about we split the difference and settle on $10750? This seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold of $12,000.  However, I'm still within the negotiation phase and have a few rounds left.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for a better offer from Bob.  He's shown interest, and I want to see if I can push him a little further. 
* **Balancing Risk:** I'm considering John's offer, but I don't want to miss out on potentially getting closer to my desired price of $12,000.

**Next Move:**

* I'll make another counteroffer in Round 5, aiming to close the gap with Bob's offer while still maintaining a profitable margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $10,750 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment. Let's close this deal, shall we?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm only slightly lowering my counteroffer from the previous round. It shows flexibility without drastically jeopardizing my profit.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I again highlight the product's worth to reinforce its value for Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** The tone is encouraging and focuses on closing the deal. 
* **Urgency:** I subtly hint at the possibility of moving on to another buyer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to carefully weigh the remaining rounds and John's offer. If Bob's counteroffer in Round 6 is still significantly lower than $11,000, I might consider accepting John's offer to avoid further risk.
* However, I'm still hoping to find a mutually acceptable price with Bob, as I believe the product is worth more to him than $10,750."
