Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly below what I know the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focusing on the value the product offers to Bob, making it a more appealing offer.

**Strategy:**

This is a starting point to gauge Bob's interest. By offering a slightly lower price than what I believe is his maximum, I can encourage him to counter-offer, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement closer to the true value of the product. 

If he rejects this offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and consider whether to accept or make another counter-offer myself, always keeping John's offer of $1,200,000 as my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price from John ($1,200,000), it's still significantly below my desired price point. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can likely secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and counter-offer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,450,000. I'll use a combination of friendly language and a logical justification for my counter-offer, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,300,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, reflecting the significant value the product offers. This price is still very competitive and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $1,400,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a profitable price point for me. 
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product, highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial deal, and using friendly language to foster a collaborative approach. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a win-win scenario. This counter-offer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still staying within a range that benefits me. I believe this approach will lead to a successful negotiation and a higher final price than Bob's initial counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is now within a range I'm willing to accept.  While it's still a bit below what I initially hoped for, it's above my minimum acceptable price from John ($1,200,000) and reflects a good compromise. 

**Rationale:**

* **Value:** The deal is still profitable for me.
* **Risk:**  Further negotiation might not lead to a significantly better price. 
* **Time:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale, ensuring a successful negotiation and securing a fair price for the product."
