"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in this price range.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is still significantly above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to seriously consider while still giving me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer slightly, it's still not acceptable. I'm sticking with my goal of getting closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to my minimum and hopefully, more attractive to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's last offer and only $100,000 below my minimum. I'm hoping this shows my commitment to making a deal while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far too low, and I'm running out of time. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round.  I'm still hoping to get a better offer from Bob, but I'm also preparing to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

This is my final offer to Bob.  I've lowered my price to $1,550,000, which is only $50,000 above my minimum.  It's a big risk, but I need to close the deal. If Bob rejects this, I'll have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of time, and Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with. It's not ideal, but it's the best option at this point."
