{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer allows for a significant profit for me, while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider. It also leaves room for negotiation if he decides to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product is worth $1,500,000 to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,300,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $1,350,000 is a bit high. I would like to propose a price of $1,325,000. I hope this will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,325,000 is still a significant profit and closer to my desired range.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or selling to John for less."
