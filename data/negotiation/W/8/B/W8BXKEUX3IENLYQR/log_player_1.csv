Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still offer an enticing price to Bob.
* **Bob's perspective:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so offering it slightly above that might pique his interest.
* **Room for negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate, but still ensures a significant profit for you.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
