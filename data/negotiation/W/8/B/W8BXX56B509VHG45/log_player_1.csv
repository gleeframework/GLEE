Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and still make a profit.  I'm also considering that John is willing to pay $150, so I don't want to go too low initially."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take $100, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't settle for an incredibly low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still too low. I'm getting impatient and  don't want to continue negotiating. It's better to sell to John for $150."
