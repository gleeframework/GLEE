Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer it to you for $100. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $90, and it's not worth risking missing out on John's $80 offer.  You've tried negotiating, but it's time to cut your losses and get the guaranteed good deal."
