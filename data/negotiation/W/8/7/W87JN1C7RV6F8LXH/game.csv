"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in your product. While I appreciate its value, I am looking to keep the investment within a budget of $800,000. Therefore, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. It's a game-changer in ways you might not fully realize yet. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $2,000,000? I believe this price reflects its value while acknowledging your initial offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your response. Given our previous discussions, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000.
