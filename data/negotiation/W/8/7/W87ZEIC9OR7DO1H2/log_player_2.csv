"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $800,000 from John. It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It makes sense to continue negotiating to see if you can get a better price. You can still get the product for a lower price from John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit away from my minimum.  How about $925,000?  This price reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us.  Let's aim for a final agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. While you could continue negotiating, it's unlikely that you'll be able to get Alice down to your target price.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000, ensuring you get the product within your budget."
