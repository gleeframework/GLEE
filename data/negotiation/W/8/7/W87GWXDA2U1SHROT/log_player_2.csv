"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $850,000? This would still leave you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.
