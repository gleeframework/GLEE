"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Could we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $850,000? This would still leave you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference. How about $800,000? This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and your potential profit margin.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation.",800000.0,Alice,5,
