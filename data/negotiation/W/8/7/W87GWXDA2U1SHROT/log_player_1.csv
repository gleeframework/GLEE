{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as fair, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to counter-offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate.  My minimum value is $1,000,000, so I can walk away at any point and still sell to John.
* By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I hope to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Could we settle around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's also much lower than my initial offer of $950,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it does indicate his willingness to negotiate. There's still room to find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter-offer with a price that's closer to my desired value but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $850,000? This would still leave you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair compromise considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm presenting this counteroffer as a compromise, acknowledging Bob's initial rejection but also standing my ground.
* **Reasonable Price:**  $850,000 is still above Bob's initial offer but significantly lower than my original asking price. This shows flexibility while maintaining a profitable outcome for me. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the product's value and potential for profit for Bob to reinforce the fairness of my offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Move Towards Agreement:** By offering a price closer to Bob's initial offer, I'm signaling my desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  The counteroffer still keeps my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 in mind, ensuring I don't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** While Bob is getting closer, there's still room for him to increase his offer.  It's worth seeing if he's willing to go higher.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter-offer with a price that's closer to my desired value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price that bridges the gap between our current offers, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference. How about $800,000? This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and your potential profit margin.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering $800,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $850,000 and Bob's latest offer of $750,000.  This shows a willingness to meet halfway and reach a compromise.
* **Win-Win Focus:**  I'm emphasizing the ""win-win"" aspect of this deal, highlighting the benefits for both of us.  
* **Finality:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also suggesting that $800,000 is a good final price.  I want to see if Bob is ready to settle.

**Strategy:**

* **Pressure to Accept:** By suggesting a ""final"" price and highlighting the benefits, I'm putting a bit of pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Near Minimum:** This offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  If Bob rejects this, I'm ready to sell to John."
