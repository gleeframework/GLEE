Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's worth attempting to sell to Bob for a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob recognizes its value to him at $8,000.  He gets a perceived deal, and you make a larger profit than your guaranteed sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some space for negotiation if Bob counters. You can then decide if you want to go slightly lower or maintain your price, knowing John provides a safety net."
