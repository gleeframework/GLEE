Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum price of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation. It also demonstrates your confidence in the product's value while still being within a range that Bob might consider given his perceived value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it is still significantly lower than the value I initially proposed and what I believe the product is worth. I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. It's important to keep in mind that Bob's maximum willingness to pay is $1,500,000. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and leaves room for further bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly closer to my initial offer than his previous counteroffers.  It's also higher than selling to John, making it the most financially beneficial choice at this point."
