Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows for some potential back-and-forth if Bob wants to negotiate.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $13,000 or $13,500 is still more profitable than selling to John for $12,000."
