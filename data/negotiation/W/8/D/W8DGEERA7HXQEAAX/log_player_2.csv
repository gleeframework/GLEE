The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is too high. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still higher than the $10,000 that Bob is willing to pay.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, it makes sense to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John."
