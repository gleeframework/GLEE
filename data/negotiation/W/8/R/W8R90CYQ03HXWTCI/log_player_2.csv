"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that's truly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum price, but it's still a significant markup from her value of $8,000. 
* Rejecting her offer opens up the possibility of negotiating a lower price.  
* While you risk losing the deal with Alice, you have a backup option with John at $12,000. There's room to try and get a better deal from Alice before resorting to John."
