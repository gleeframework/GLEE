Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

Since I know John is willing to pay $1,200,000, I'm offering Bob the same price. This way, I maximize my profit. Bob can either accept and get the product for a price that is less than what it's worth to him, or he can reject the offer and I can sell it to John for the full value."
