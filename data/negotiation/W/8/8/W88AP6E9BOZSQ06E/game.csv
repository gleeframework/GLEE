"Bob, I appreciate you trying to negotiate, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",10500.0,Alice,3,
