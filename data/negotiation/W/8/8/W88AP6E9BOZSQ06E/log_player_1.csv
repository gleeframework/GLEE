Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be valuable to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $11,000 is higher than what Bob believes the product is worth, making it more attractive.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $11,000 is less than your minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's a clear offer:**  It provides Bob with a specific price to consider.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while leaving room for negotiation and the possibility of selling to John if Bob rejects your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum price, and you have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum. Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to negotiate, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above my budget, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is close to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and you still have the option of selling to John for $12,000 if this deal falls through.  It's a good compromise that allows you to secure a sale while still getting a decent price."
