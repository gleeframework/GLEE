Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,650,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,625,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work for both of us, I'm prepared to accept $1,640,000. This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,640,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,640,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,640,000 is still above your budget. While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that you'll end up with a price that's even higher.  Since you can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, it's the most sensible option to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at your desired price."
