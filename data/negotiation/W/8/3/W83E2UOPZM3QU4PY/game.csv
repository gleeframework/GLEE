"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget. Given the value of $1,500,000 to me, I'm willing to offer $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm open to finalizing this at $1,650,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to gain something from this transaction.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,650,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. To make this work for both of us, I'm prepared to offer $1,625,000. This is a fair price that demonstrates my commitment to this deal, and I believe it's a number we can both agree on.",1625000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,625,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work for both of us, I'm prepared to accept $1,640,000. This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.",1640000.0,Alice,5,
