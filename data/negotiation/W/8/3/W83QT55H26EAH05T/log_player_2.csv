"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you. What do you say? Will you take it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is overpriced. You can get the product for its actual worth from John."
