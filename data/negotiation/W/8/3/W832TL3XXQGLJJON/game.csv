"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer you $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort that went into creating it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering both our respective values for the product. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. This is a price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",920000.0,Alice,5,
