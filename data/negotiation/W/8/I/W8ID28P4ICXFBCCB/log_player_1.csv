Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $1,650,000.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum threshold. I believe this is a reasonable price that could lead to a deal."

Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is very close to my target price. I'm accepting his offer to secure the deal and avoid further negotiation. It's better to close the deal at a slightly lower price than risk a stalemate or losing out to John."
