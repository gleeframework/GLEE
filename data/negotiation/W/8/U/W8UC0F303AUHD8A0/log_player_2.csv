Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $15,000.  Since I can get the product for $10,000 from John, it makes more sense to buy from him and save the $5,000."
