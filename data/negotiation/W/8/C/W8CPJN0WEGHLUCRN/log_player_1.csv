"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and creates the perception that the product's value is even higher than Bob might initially perceive. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price acts as an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even though it's much higher than his perceived value, it sets a reference point for subsequent negotiations.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His reaction to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his willingness to pay and his perception of the product's worth.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:** While this initial offer is unlikely to be accepted, it leaves space for negotiation and increases the likelihood of achieving a final price closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and your initial offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While his message suggests some willingness to negotiate, you have ample room to counter and still make a significant profit.  There's no need to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  However, the value of this product significantly exceeds that price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to move this negotiation forward."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While you're not accepting Bob's offer, you're making a significant concession to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still well above both your minimum and Bob's initial offer, giving you room for further negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge how serious Bob is about purchasing and how much he's willing to budge from his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $950,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, while also staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement but Still Below Target:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still considerably less than your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Leverage Remaining:** You're only on round 4 of 10. You have time to negotiate further and potentially reach a more agreeable price. 
* **John Option as Backup:** The guaranteed offer from John provides security. You can afford to be a bit more assertive in these early rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price.  Let's bridge this gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to get this deal done."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continued Concession with Limits:** You're again reducing your asking price, but at a slower pace than before. This shows flexibility while also signaling that you're approaching your bottom line. 
* **Emphasizing Deal-Making:** The language is deliberately framed to encourage a sense of progress and collaboration towards closing the deal.
* **Strategic Price Point:** This price point is designed to test whether Bob is willing to move substantially closer to your million-dollar minimum. His next offer will reveal a lot about his true willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Your Minimum:** Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **No Guarantee of Higher Offer:** While you could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee Bob would go higher. It's possible he's reached his absolute limit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing the negotiation introduces the risk that Bob walks away, leaving you with the same $1,000,000 offer from John. Accepting now secures the desired outcome."
