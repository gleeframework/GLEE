Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy [product name] before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you!  I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 allows for some back and forth if Bob wants to negotiate.
* **Time Value and Certainty:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John. Getting $11,500 quickly from Bob is preferable to waiting for the guaranteed sale. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he is for the product."
