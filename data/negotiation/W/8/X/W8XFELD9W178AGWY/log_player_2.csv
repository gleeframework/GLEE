"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While I believe the product offers you even more value than that, I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what you're getting. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,250 is a better price than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  There's still potential to negotiate further. Rejecting allows Bob to try and get closer to his desired $9,500."
