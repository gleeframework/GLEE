"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,350,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
