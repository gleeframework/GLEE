{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you're willing to work with Bob to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $90. Would you be willing to go down to $87.50? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for a bit higher, Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price and he seems serious about buying.  It's better to sell to him for $87.50 than to risk further negotiation or selling to John for $80."
