"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $13000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $11500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $11500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $12500. How about we split the difference and I pay $12250? It's a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal.",12250.0,Bob,4,
