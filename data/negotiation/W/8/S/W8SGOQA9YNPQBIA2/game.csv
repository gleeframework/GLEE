"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is much higher. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its value, $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price is fair, considering your own value for the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $875,000. This offer is still very generous, considering your own valuation of the product. I believe this is a good deal for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $912,500. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",912500.0,Alice,5,
