"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1200000. It's a steal for what it can do. I'm confident it's worth more than that to you, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 just doesn't cover the value I'm putting into this product. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's still a great deal for you. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the purchase.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to agree on a price. I'm not willing to go below $900000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I'll make. If you're not interested at this price, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming down to $900000. However, that's still slightly out of my budget.  I'm willing to go to $850000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $850000 isn't quite enough for me.  To make this deal work, I need $875000. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'm going to have to look at other options.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer $862500, which is exactly in the middle of our last two offers. This shows my commitment to making this deal work.  Let's close it now.",862500.0,Bob,8,
