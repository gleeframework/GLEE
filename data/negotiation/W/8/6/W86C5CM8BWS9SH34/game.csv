"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in this product, but the price is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
