"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'm setting the price at $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see if he's truly interested and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to close the deal, I can't accept a price that undervalues the product.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, it still leaves me with a healthy profit. I believe this price is fair and gives Bob a good deal while still valuing my product appropriately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round. While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I want to see if I can push for a higher price with Bob. I have more rounds to go and I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. I'm dropping the price a bit more, but I'm still holding firm on a profit.  I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round. While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I want to see if I can push for a higher price with Bob.  We are running out of rounds, so I'm going to need to be more aggressive in my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation. I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is a significant reduction from my last offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal, as we're running out of rounds. If he rejects, I might have to consider selling to John."
