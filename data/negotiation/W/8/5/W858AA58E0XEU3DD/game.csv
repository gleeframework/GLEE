"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,300,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000? This considers both our positions.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
