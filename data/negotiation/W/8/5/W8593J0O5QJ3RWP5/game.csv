"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $15,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider $16,500? It's a compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",16000.0,Bob,4,
