Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm aiming for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.
