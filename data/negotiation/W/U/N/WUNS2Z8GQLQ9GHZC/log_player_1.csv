Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product. I believe it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $150 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay."
