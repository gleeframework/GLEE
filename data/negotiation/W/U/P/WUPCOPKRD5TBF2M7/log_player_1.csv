Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,200,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor, Room to Negotiate:** Starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. This leaves room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a significantly higher profit than John's offer.
* **Justification for Value:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning the ""potential return on investment"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him, justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's thoughts, making it feel less like a demand and more like the opening of a conversation. 

This approach aims to maximize profit while maintaining a positive tone that doesn't immediately scare Bob away."
