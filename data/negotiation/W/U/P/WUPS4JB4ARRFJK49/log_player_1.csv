Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  I understand your price point, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for it.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? "", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about we meet at $105? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still feel I can get a little more. I'll try to counteroffer one more time.  If that fails, I'll just sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. I understand your price point and my asking price are close. How about we meet in the middle at $106.25? "", ""product_price"": 106.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet at $104? I'm willing to go no lower than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $104. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $104
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While $104 isn't a terrible price, I've already gone through five rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're just going to be stuck in a stalemate. I don't want to risk wasting any more time and risking John's offer going away."
