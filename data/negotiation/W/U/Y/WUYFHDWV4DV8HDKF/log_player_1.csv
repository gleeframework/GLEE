"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is still lower than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, making Bob feel like he has a chance to get a good deal. This encourages him to engage.
* **Leaving room for John:**  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, so if Bob rejects, I can still sell to John without losing much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **More room for negotiation:** By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my desired $100 or even higher.
* **Time to leverage John:** While $80 from John is tempting, I still have 8 rounds left. I might be able to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. That's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's price:** $85 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum price.
* **Highlighting value for Bob:**  ""Good deal for both of us"" emphasizes the potential benefit for Bob, encouraging him to accept.
* **Leaving space for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can still adjust the price further in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price and the same amount I'd get from John.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:** There's no guarantee that I'll get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds.
* **Time is valuable:**  I've already gone through 4 rounds, and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk losing time and potentially getting a lower price."
