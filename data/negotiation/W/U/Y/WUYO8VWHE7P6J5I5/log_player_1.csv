Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to counteroffer at $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. I will try to get closer to that by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $10,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

It seems Bob is unwilling to budge further from $9,600. While I'm getting close to my target price, the negotiation is taking too long and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better offer. It's better to be safe than sorry, so I'll sell the product to John for $12,000 to guarantee my minimum value."
