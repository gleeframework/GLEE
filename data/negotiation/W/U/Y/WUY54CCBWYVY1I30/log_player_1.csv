"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price given its potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high price allows for potential negotiation room and positions me as the seller with the upper hand.
* **Fairness Argument:**  While the price is high, I use the ""fairness"" argument to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I encourage Bob to respond with his thoughts and potentially counteroffer. 

**Note:** This is just the first offer. I'm open to adjusting my strategy based on Bob's responses and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $950000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum:**  While $950,000 is a good price, it's still significantly less than my initial offer of $1,000,000. I believe I can push for a better price.
* **Negotiation room:**  We have 8 rounds remaining, giving me time to counter and negotiate.  I want to see if I can bridge the gap between $950,000 and my target price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, but it leaves $150,000 on the table. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially get closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price to reflect the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $975,000? This would ensure a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a smaller step:** Instead of making a drastic counteroffer, I'm suggesting a price that is only $25,000 higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob about the product's value to reinforce my position and justify the slightly higher price.
* **Mutually beneficial:** I'm using the phrase ""mutually beneficial"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and collaboration.

**Goal:** To find a price that is acceptable to both of us while still ensuring a good profit for me."
