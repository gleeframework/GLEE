"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase my product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 was still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $675,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $685,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting the $685,000 offer secures a good deal for Bob, saving him $115,000 compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice pulling out or refusing to budge further."
