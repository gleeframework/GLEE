"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its value and benefits, I'm extending this exclusive offer to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is good, the price is a little steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a low offer helps gauge Alice's flexibility.  There's a good chance Alice will reject this, but it gives us room to negotiate upwards and still potentially stay well below John's $8,000 backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. In order to meet somewhere in the middle, I am proposing a revised offer of $9,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but she's still above our fallback price with John. We need to push her closer to our range. Let's see if we can get her to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but to be honest, my budget is really maxed out at $7,000. If you can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're acknowledging her compromise while standing firm on our budget limitations.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""closing the deal today"" might encourage her to agree now rather than risk further negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $7,000 keeps us below John's price but gives Alice room to counter if she's completely unwilling to go that low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your commitment to the deal, Bob. Considering your budget constraints, I am willing to negotiate further. My final offer for the product is $8,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her ""final offer"" and it's still above John's price. While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will budge, and we risk losing the guaranteed $8,000 deal with John. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at the best available price."
