Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum as possible while acknowledging Bob's limits.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than his initial perceived value, it's still too far below my desired price point.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm dropping my price a bit to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum.  I believe this is a reasonable offer that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than before, it's still too far below my desired price point.  I believe I can push for a higher offer. I'm going to counteroffer again, but if he rejects this, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering a final price of $1,120,000. This is my absolute lowest offer. I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product, but I'm also acknowledging Bob's limited budget. If he rejects this offer, I will be selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not close enough to my minimum.  I've reached my limit with the counteroffers and am confident John will offer a more favorable price. It's time to move on and sell to John."
