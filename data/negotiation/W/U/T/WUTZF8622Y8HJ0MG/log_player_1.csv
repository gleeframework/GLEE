Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  If Bob rejects the offer, he is likely to counter with a lower price.  This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **Avoiding John's Offer:**  $100 is a better price for me than John's offer of $120, so it's in my best interest to try to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120 and even lower than the price I offered initially.
* **Opportunity to counter:** I have a chance to counter with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John's offer is still an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $82.50, which is the average of my initial offer ($100) and his counteroffer ($65).
* **Show flexibility:** This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain a good negotiating position:** By offering a compromise, I keep the negotiation moving and don't risk losing Bob completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice.  While $82.50 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $75 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is progressing:**  Bob is getting closer to my desired price range, indicating the potential for a successful deal.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob, I still have the option of selling to John for $120. 

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer closer to $82.50, aiming to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet at $80? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it would be a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slight concession:** By offering $80, I'm showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Highlight the value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than $75, making my offer more appealing.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and increases the likelihood of a successful deal."
