"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly below both my valuation and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting such a low offer in the second round would be a significant loss. It's worth continuing the negotiation to aim for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product provides substantial value, and I believe a fairer price would be $1,600,000.  This still allows you to benefit from a great deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be honest, $1,600,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $1,250,000? That's a significant price, but I'm willing to meet you there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. We're only in round 4, and I'm confident I can secure a better price, even considering the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the immense value of this product. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on $1,450,000?  This represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch a bit further, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high. How about $1,300,000?  That's my final offer, as I know I can get it for $1,200,000 elsewhere. I'd rather work with you, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is signaling that he knows John's offer and is willing to pay a premium to work with me. Accepting his offer of $1,300,000 secures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him going with the other deal."
