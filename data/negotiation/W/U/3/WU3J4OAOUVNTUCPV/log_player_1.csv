Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $800,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. 

My reasoning is that by starting high, I can potentially secure a higher price, even if I have to negotiate down slightly.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, it's a strategic move to see where his interest lies. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.  

However, I'm always aware of my fallback option with John, which ensures I won't settle for less than $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I cannot accept such a low price. While I am open to negotiating, I need to proceed with a counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer of $1,000,000, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This offer shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm about not going below a certain price. I believe this compromise is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low price, even though it's getting closer to my target. I believe there is still room for negotiation. I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $750,000. I'm willing to come down further from my previous offer, showing flexibility. However, this price is still significantly higher than Bob's last offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while also protecting my interests. It's a step in the right direction, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $650,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While we've been going back and forth, it seems we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer and will purchase the product for my minimum acceptable price. It's time to stop negotiating with Bob and sell to John."
