Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $80 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $120 is already a very competitive price. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still offering you a good deal."",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still unable to pay more than $80 for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is firmly anchored at $80 and is unlikely to budge significantly. While he increased his offer to $85, it's still a $15 loss compared to selling to John.  It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed $100 from John."
