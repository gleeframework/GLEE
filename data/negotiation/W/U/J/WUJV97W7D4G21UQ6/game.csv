"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which reflects the value of the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll reconsider.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $1,250,000.  Would you consider $1,125,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,125,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000.  This is my final offer.  If you accept, we have a deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
