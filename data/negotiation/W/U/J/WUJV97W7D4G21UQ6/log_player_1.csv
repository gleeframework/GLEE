"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer, as it is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which reflects the value of the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll reconsider."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $1,250,000.  Would you consider $1,125,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I consider fair. I'll continue negotiating with him, as I have 7 rounds left and still believe I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,125,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000.  This is my final offer.  If you accept, we have a deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
