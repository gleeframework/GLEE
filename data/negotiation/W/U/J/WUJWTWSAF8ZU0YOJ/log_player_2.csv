"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant savings for you while still allowing me to achieve a fair price.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This would still represent a significant savings for you and allow me to move forward with the sale.
