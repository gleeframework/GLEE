"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, but it's still higher than John's offer. I'll try to negotiate a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10250}"
