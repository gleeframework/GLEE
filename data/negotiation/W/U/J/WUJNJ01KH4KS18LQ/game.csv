,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is closer, but I'm still a little higher than where I need to be.  How about $95?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92. Let's try to find a middle ground.",92.0,Bob,4,
