"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can do $9000, which is a compromise from my original offer. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can do $8200, which is a bit closer to your offer but still a bit above your price. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8200 and my target price of $7500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $7900?",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. I can do $8000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to sell it to you. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Alice,7,
