"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me. How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a significant saving compared to what the product is worth to you. Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500 is a bit too high for me. How about we try $10,250? That's the lowest I can go.",10250.0,Bob,4,
