"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a significantly high offer to establish a strong bargaining position. This leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. 
* **Confident Tone:** By expressing confidence in the product's value and our ability to reach a deal, I aim to influence Bob's perception and encourage a serious counteroffer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial price signals I'm willing to negotiate, but it's crucial to start high to maximize my potential gain. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but considering my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While his counter-offer was expected, accepting $1,000,000 would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, even if it means potentially going back and forth a few more rounds.  Selling to John at this point would be the safe option, but I believe I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective on the product's value. I understand your budget constraints, however, the  $1,000,000 offer falls significantly below its true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Validate:** I've started by acknowledging Bob's offer and his budget considerations. This shows I'm listening and willing to find common ground.
* **Reaffirm Value:**  While acknowledging Bob's perspective, I'm also subtly reiterating the product's inherent value. 
* **Significant Reduction:** My counteroffer is a substantial drop from the initial price, signaling flexibility. However, it's still significantly above Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm framing the new price as a gesture of goodwill and an attempt to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. 

This strategy aims to bring Bob closer to a more reasonable price range while keeping the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now within a range that I find acceptable. While it's less than my ideal price, it's still a significant profit over my minimum. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale."
