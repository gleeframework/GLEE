Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
