This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a clear price point while also highlighting the value of the product. By offering a price higher than your minimum, you leave room for potential negotiation but also demonstrate your confidence in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This represents a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal considering its potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

I'm still holding out for at least $1,000,000.  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little further."
