"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $140, which is a bit above Bob's value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging message helps build rapport and increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer. 
* **Leaving Room:** If Bob rejects, I can come down slightly in subsequent rounds without feeling like I'm giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Above Minimum:** While $130 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Selling to John guarantees me $150, but I'm confident I can do better by keeping the negotiation with Bob going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $135? That's still a good price for this product, and it's closer to your budget."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing flexibility while still maintaining my profit margin. 
* **Positive Framing:**  Emphasizing the ""good deal"" and closeness to his budget encourages acceptance.
* **Avoiding Stalemate:**  A small counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids the risk of Bob getting frustrated and walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $128 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, but I'm still determined to get closer to my goal.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, suggesting he might be willing to go a bit higher. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $150, I'm willing to take a chance to see if I can push Bob a bit further and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really want to make this deal work. Let's split the difference. How about $131.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to your budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 131.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Again):** I'm once again proposing a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This demonstrates a genuine desire to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** While $131.50 is closer to Bob's value, it still allows me to earn more than my minimum requirement of $150.
* **Encouraging a Response:**  The question ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to actively participate in the negotiation and consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I believe we can agree on a price closer to my budget. Could you consider $127? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:**  Bob's offer of $127 is getting very close to my minimum, but I'm not confident I can get him to budge much further. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal and losing time for further negotiation is too high.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is more than my minimum and avoids the potential for a lower price or a deal falling through. 
* **Prioritizing Certainty:**  While I'd like to achieve a higher price, ensuring a sale with John gives me a guaranteed profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
