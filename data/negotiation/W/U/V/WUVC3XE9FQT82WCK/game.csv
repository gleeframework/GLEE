"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $780000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",780000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $780000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm open to selling for $820000. This price still leaves room for you to make a good return on your investment. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $820000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the fact that I can purchase it elsewhere for that amount.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
