"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value and potential.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the value of this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a great value for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a significant step up from my previous offer and a price I'm comfortable with.",775000.0,Bob,4,
