"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially find a middle ground. A $1 million offer is a significant discount from $1.5 million, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still slightly above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. Since I have a backup option with John, I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $1,150,000.  This is still a considerable discount from Alice's latest offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise while staying within my budget constraints.  It's a calculated risk that Alice might be willing to come down a bit further to close the deal."
