"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,800,000 is  significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $2,100,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your enthusiasm. ",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $2,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your target, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but that offer is a significant gap from where we need to be. To be frank, I'm close to accepting another offer. If you're serious, I'd need to see $1,975,000 to continue this negotiation.",1975000.0,Alice,7,
