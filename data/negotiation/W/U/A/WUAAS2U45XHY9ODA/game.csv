"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product. I believe it's worth at least $18,000, considering its unique features and benefits.  I'm willing to start at $17,500 for you.",17500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $17,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $14,000 for it, considering it's still a good deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about $16,000?  This is still a good price considering the value of this product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000.  This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
