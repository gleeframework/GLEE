"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it allows room for negotiation while still maximizing potential profit. It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept such a low price at this stage.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  This gives Bob room to negotiate further while ensuring I don't lose out on a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is sticking to his original offer of $1,200,000, which is far below my minimum. I'm not willing to settle for that, and selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a good option.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while still remaining above my minimum price.  It's possible Bob might be willing to meet me halfway at this point, but if not, I'll still have the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to pay a price close to my minimum, and the rounds are getting short.  Selling to John at this point is the most sensible choice.  I'll get a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a good outcome considering my minimum price."
