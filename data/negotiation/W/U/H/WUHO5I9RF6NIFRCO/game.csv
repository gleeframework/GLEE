"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $16,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $14,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a little below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,5,
