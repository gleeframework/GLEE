"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $950,000 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer, while still leaving room for negotiation.  This counteroffer signals Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously while also demonstrating his understanding of the product's value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.  While Bob would prefer a lower price, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely and being forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product while staying within his budget."
