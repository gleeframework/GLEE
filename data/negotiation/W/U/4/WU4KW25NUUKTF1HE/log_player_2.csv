"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $5,000 is a great price, but there's a good chance Alice will go lower. We should see what her counteroffer is after rejecting this one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $3,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still a reasonable price, given the potential value of the product. This will let us see if Alice is willing to negotiate down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$4,000 is still a decent price, but Alice has already shown a willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can get her down to $3,500 or even $3,750."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3750}
``` 

I'm going to offer $3,750. This is a compromise between our previous offer and Alice's offer.  It shows that we're serious about buying the product, but we're still trying to get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly not going to budge much from her current position.  Let's see if we can get her to meet us in the middle by offering a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

We're going to split the difference with Alice's offer and our last counteroffer. This is a good middle ground that shows we're serious about closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Alice's offers are getting closer to our maximum budget, but we're still not getting a good deal.  It's time to cut our losses and go with John's offer.  It's guaranteed to be within our budget, and we've already wasted some time with Alice."
