"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and gauge his interest.  I'm confident I can get more than John's offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I want to see if I can push for a bit more. I'm going to counter with a price closer to $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly, showing Bob I'm serious about getting a good price. I'm hoping this encourages him to come closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I would prefer to get closer to $950,000, I'm not sure I can push him any further. I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to settle with John's $800,000 offer.  This seems like a good compromise."
