"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1000000 for this product.  It's a great deal for both of us â€“ I get a great product, and you get a quick sale. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1150000 for the product. This is my final counteroffer for now.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a little concerned that we might be going back and forth forever, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1125000, but that's as low as I can go. I really need to make a profit on this sale.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
