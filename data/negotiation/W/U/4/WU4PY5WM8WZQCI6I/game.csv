"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still quite a ways off from what I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand we're not quite there yet. I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
