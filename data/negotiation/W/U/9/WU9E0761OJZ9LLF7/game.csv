"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find immense value in. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects the true value of the product. Let me know what you think.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our previous discussions. Can you consider this offer?",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe $1,750,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. My final offer is $1,850,000. This is a firm offer, and I won't be able to go any lower. It's a fantastic deal for a product you'll undoubtedly benefit from. What do you say?",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone above my initial budget, and I need to make a decision. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm making a counteroffer of $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
