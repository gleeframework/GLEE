"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm a bit hesitant to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000, which is closer to my budget. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position.  While that figure is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm confident we can find common ground. How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, I believe this product offers significant value beyond that figure.  My final offer is $1,275,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer that reflects the true value of this product. ",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I'm not budging beyond that. I'm starting to think that the product might not be worth the investment at this price point. I'd like to make one final offer: $1,150,000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
