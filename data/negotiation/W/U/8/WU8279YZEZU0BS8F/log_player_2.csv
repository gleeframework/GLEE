# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's value to her, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Buying from John saves you $400,000 and ensures you stay within your maximum budget."
