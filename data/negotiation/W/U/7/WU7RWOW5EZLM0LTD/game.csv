"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product.  Its value speaks for itself, and I believe it will be transformative for you. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,500,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential impact.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $1,250,000.  This reflects the true value while still offering you a great opportunity. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value. How about we settle at $950,000? This offer represents a significant investment on my part while acknowledging the product's worth.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, which is fantastic. $950,000 isn't quite there for me.  How about we land at $1,125,000?  That's a fair compromise to seal the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch to $1,000,000  - that's my final offer.  It's a win-win situation for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
