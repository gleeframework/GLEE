"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $110 for it. This allows us both to find a fair compromise. Looking forward to your response.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of this product for me. However, $110 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. This would still be a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your value and within my range. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. I'd like to counter with a price of $107 for the product. This slightly increases my previous offer but still keeps the transaction beneficial for both parties. I hope this proposal works for you.",107.0,Alice,3,
