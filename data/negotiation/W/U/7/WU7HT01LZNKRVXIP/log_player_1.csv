"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. It's a fair price that considers its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000? It's a reasonable compromise that brings us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $775,000 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $812,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 812500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $790,000. This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've only got a few rounds left and it's getting too risky to keep negotiating. I'll take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
