"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $950000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too far away from your new offer. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not ready to go up to $900000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $860000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from this product. Can you meet me at this price?",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to squeeze out a bit more savings. I'm willing to pay $875000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. Can you consider this offer?",875000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $890000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.
