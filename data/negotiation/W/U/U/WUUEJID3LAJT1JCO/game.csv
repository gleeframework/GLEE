"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested,  $10,000 is a bit above what I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also accommodating your budget.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,750. This is the minimum price I need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll give you a discount of $250 from my original offer. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9750.0,Alice,5,
