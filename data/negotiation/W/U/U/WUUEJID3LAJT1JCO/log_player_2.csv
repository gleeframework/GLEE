Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also accommodating your budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,750. This is the minimum price I need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll give you a discount of $250 from my original offer. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer of $9,750 is still too high. At this point, you should buy the product from John for $8,000. You've been negotiating with Alice for a while, and it seems like she's not willing to go lower.  It's better to save the money and go with John's offer."
