"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly lower, it's worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. This demonstrates my willingness to bargain while also setting a clear expectation of my desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $60 is a good deal for me. It's significantly lower than my initial offer, and still within my budget. Continuing to negotiate further might save a few dollars, but the risk of Alice walking away or the deal collapsing is not worth the potential savings."
