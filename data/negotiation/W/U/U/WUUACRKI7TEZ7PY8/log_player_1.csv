"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $108. This is a fair price considering I'm already close to my maximum budget.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $112.  It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $112.  I'm willing to pay $110.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a good deal for Alice as it's above her minimum price of $120 and gets her a deal quicker.  Although John offers a higher price, Alice has limited time to sell to Bob.  It makes sense to accept this offer now."
