"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the fact that I've already dropped my price considerably. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to meet my budget constraints, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline at $1,050,000. I am now prepared to offer $1,025,000 as a final attempt to reach an agreement. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
