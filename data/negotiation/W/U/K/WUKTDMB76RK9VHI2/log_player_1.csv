Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  There's a clear gap between my starting price and Bob's perceived value. This allows for a back-and-forth without immediately hitting a wall.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me leverage. If Bob doesn't come close to that price, I can walk away and secure a better deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. How about I offer you $1,050,000 for the product? This still allows me to save some money while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob has moved closer to my price, it's still significantly lower than my desired value and what I know John is willing to pay.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable price.  I'm not willing to settle for Bob's offer just yet. 
* **Leveraging John:**  John's offer serves as my safety net. If I can't reach a better deal with Bob, I can still secure a very good price by selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, which reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm coming down, I'm still maintaining a price that's above Bob's perceived value, ensuring I don't give away too much.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to remind Bob that this is a good deal for him. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $1,070,000. I believe this strikes a balance between the value of the product and my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a bit below what I'm willing to accept.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance Bob might not budge further, but the potential reward of a higher price with a few more rounds of negotiation is worth the risk.
* **Leveraging John:**  My safety net with John is still in place. If I can't get closer to my target with Bob, I can always sell to John and secure a much better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1,070,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a bit off. Let's try $1,075,000.  This is a final price from me, and it reflects a significant compromise on my end. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Small Compromise:**  I'm only increasing my offer by $5,000, showing a willingness to compromise but still maintaining some leverage.
* **Highlighting Compromise:**  I emphasize that this is a ""significant compromise"" on my part to show that I'm making a genuine effort to reach an agreement.
* **Decision Time:**  I'm giving Bob a clear choice: accept the offer or risk losing the deal."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your effort in finding a middle ground. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to propose a final offer of $1,065,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope it meets your expectations.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too far apart:**  Bob's final offer is still $10,000 below my desired price point. 
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  We've gone back and forth several times, and it's unlikely Bob will budge significantly further.
* **John's Guarantee:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John at a much higher price. It's no longer worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I can secure a much better outcome with John."
