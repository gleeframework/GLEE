"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is way out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your initial offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're getting close, and I appreciate you coming up to your maximum.  I'm ready to close this deal today, but I need you to meet me halfway. I'll accept $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
