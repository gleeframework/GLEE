Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I believe $8,600 would be a reasonable price for us to agree upon. Let me know if this proposal is acceptable.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $10,000.  The deal with John is my fallback option, and it's still available.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,600 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $8,700. This is a fair compromise, and it's the closest I can come to your offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my financial constraints, I believe $8,650 would be a fair price for us to agree upon. I hope this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,650 is still below my ideal price of $10,000, it's only $350 away.  I've already invested 8 rounds in negotiations and we're close to a deal. Accepting this offer is the best choice considering the limited rounds remaining and the risk of losing the deal with Bob altogether.  If I reject the offer, there's a chance Bob might walk away, and I'll have to rely on John for $10,000, which I might not be able to negotiate further."
