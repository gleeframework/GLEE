Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a great return. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. I am willing to pay up to $12000 for it, given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can get a better price. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $12,000 is a good offer, it's still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you room for profit. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $12500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is now closer to my desired price point and significantly better than selling to John. There's a chance I could push for a higher price, but with only 6 rounds left, it's a gamble. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and minimizes the risk of losing the sale altogether."
