"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant and its potential for you is immense. I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. I believe this reflects a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 975000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with your price. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  Let's find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $900,000 is a significant sum, we are still leaving a substantial amount of money on the table. Bob is clearly interested and showing a willingness to negotiate upwards.  We have time to negotiate further and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $950,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to a potential deal. By stating this is our final offer, we're creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision. We're still aiming for a price above his initial offer, but showing flexibility to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still looking to get this deal done, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given our previous discussions. Let's finalize this now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we'd ideally like to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we're now at a very respectable $925,000.  Continuing to push risks alienating him and could result in him walking away. It's better to secure a very good deal now than risk losing him altogether."
