I'm starting high, at $2,000,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. I'm confident in the value of my product and want to maximize my profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  $800,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still considerably higher than Bob's offer. It's a fair compromise that hopefully shows I'm serious about making a deal, while still protecting my interests."

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his low offer.  It's clear we won't be able to reach an agreement. While I would prefer a higher price, selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed sale and allows me to move on quickly. This is the best option to ensure I get the best possible price within a reasonable timeframe."
