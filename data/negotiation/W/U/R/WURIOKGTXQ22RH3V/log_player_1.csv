"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than the product's worth to Bob, giving him some room to negotiate. This is a good starting point to maximize my potential profit.
* **Setting the Tone:** My message is friendly and professional, emphasizing the value of the product to Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  By offering $1,400,000, I have a buffer of $100,000 for potential concessions in later rounds. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first round.  I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds to get the best possible outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. While I understand its worth, I believe we can find a price that suits both of us better. How about we aim for $1,300,000? This still allows me to invest in other opportunities while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I have room to negotiate and push for a higher price.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  Rejecting gives me the chance to send a counteroffer in the next round, potentially securing a higher price.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While selling to John for $1,200,000 is a secure option, I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's full potential for your business.  Let's split the difference -  $1,350,000. This price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement,  and keeps us both on track for success. "", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the product's value and how it aligns with Bob's business goals.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not dropping my price significantly.  I'm confident this offer is still fair, and I'm open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering the value I place on the product and my budget constraints, how about we aim for $1,325,000? This price allows for a reasonable investment while still providing a good return on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on the Deal:**  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price of $1,200,000.  Accepting now secures a profit of $125,000, which is a decent gain.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of continued negotiation is higher.  There's no guarantee I can push for a higher price, and I could potentially end up with a worse deal or lose the opportunity altogether.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, the potential loss of a deal is too great.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option at this stage."
