Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you and only $8,000 to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
