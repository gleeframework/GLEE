"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $12,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I could consider coming down to $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
