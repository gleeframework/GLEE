"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to me is at least $1000000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to offer $750000.  This is a significant discount for you and a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is still a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and agree on $800000. This would be a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $815000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $815000. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we agree on $805000? It's a fair compromise, and we can move forward with the transaction. What do you think?",805000.0,Bob,6,
