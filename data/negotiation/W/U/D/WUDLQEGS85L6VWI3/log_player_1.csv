"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing this product with you. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant benefits it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a high level.
* **Leaving Room:** The offer allows space for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel more involved in the process. 

This strategy aims to achieve a high sale price while maintaining a collaborative tone for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both my initial asking price and his perceived value. Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  Demonstrate that I'm unwilling to settle for a price significantly below my target.
* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:** His response to my counteroffer will provide valuable insight into his willingness to pay closer to my desired range.

I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal while still managing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it falls significantly short of what I consider a fair price for this product.  It's truly a unique asset that will generate substantial value for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this is a competitive offer that reflects the true worth of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm doing so incrementally and emphasizing the product's value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to understand how much further Bob is willing to move and if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintaining Confidence:** My message remains firm and confident, reiterating my belief in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a strong price that falls within an acceptable range for me. Here's why it makes sense to accept:

* **Significant Profit:**  This offer represents a $200,000 profit above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Negotiation by Bob:** Bob has consistently moved closer to my asking price, indicating his serious interest in the product. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation further has diminishing returns. Accepting now secures the profit and allows me to move on to other opportunities. 

While there's a chance I could push for slightly more in subsequent rounds, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for a marginally higher price."
