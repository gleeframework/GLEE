"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This gives you a good profit, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $11,000 for the product. This is a compromise that should be beneficial for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up slightly from my previous offer to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good deal for you. Let's try to reach an agreement this round.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,500, which would be $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",10750.0,Alice,5,
