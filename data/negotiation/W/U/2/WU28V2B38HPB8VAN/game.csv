"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50? That would be fair to both of us.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $100 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $100. ",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still looking to save a bit of money. How about we meet at $97.50? I'm willing to pay a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.",97.5,Bob,6,
