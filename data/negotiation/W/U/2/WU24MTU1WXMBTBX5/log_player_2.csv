# Alice's message: I can see you're really pushing hard for this deal, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I think we can do better than that. How about we aim for $1,075,000? It's a small increment, but I think it's worth it for a product of this caliber.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're feeling the pressure, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. If not, I'm afraid we'll have to part ways.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice has made it clear she's not budging beyond $1,025,000. While we could try one more counteroffer, it's unlikely she'll move significantly. At this point, cutting our losses and buying from John for $1,500,000 is the more logical choice, even if it means paying a premium.  We've already spent considerable time and energy on this negotiation, and it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely by pushing Alice further."
