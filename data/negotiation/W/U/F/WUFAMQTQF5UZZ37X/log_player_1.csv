"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and potential concessions. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""incredible potential"" and stating the price as ""a fair reflection of its worth,"" I aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a high point. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is significantly higher than my minimum, it leaves space for negotiation and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and his own stated valuation of the product.  While I want to reach a deal, accepting such a low offer at this stage would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table. I believe I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but your offer is quite a bit below what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Understanding:** Acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal helps maintain a positive negotiating environment. 
* **Hold Firm:**  I'm reducing my asking price but still holding firm well above both my minimum and Bob's initial valuation.
* **Compromise:** By framing the new price as a ""reasonable compromise,"" I'm signaling a willingness to move towards a deal but not at the cost of undervaluing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, I still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. Since he's moved up from $600,000 to $750,000, it shows he's willing to pay more than his initial offer. I'll try to push him a bit further towards my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference between your offer and my last counteroffer? That would put us at $825,000. It feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Tone:** Continuing to use a positive and collaborative tone is important to keep the negotiation moving smoothly. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable outcome.
* **Close to Target:** This price is now comfortably above my minimum acceptable price and represents a substantial gain over John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Deal:** Bob's offer of $775,000 is very close to my backup option of selling to John for $800,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob might walk away, or our negotiations might stall. Accepting this offer guarantees a very good profit. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now also means I get the money sooner, which has its own inherent value."
