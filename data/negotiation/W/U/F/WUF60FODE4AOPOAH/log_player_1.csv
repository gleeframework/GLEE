"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than to others. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,150,000. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's maximum perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's unique value to Bob, I aim to anchor his perception of its worth at a high level. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open to discussion, signaling my willingness to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **John as Backup:**  While I'm confident in this negotiation, I have the safety net of John's offer. This knowledge empowers me to aim high with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but that price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his perceived value. While I want to negotiate, accepting this would leave too much money on the table. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal.  I'll counter in Round 3."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This reflects the significant value it holds for you."", 
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I made a substantial concession to show flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate seriously. However, the new price is still significantly above my minimum and closer to his perceived value.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm continuing to emphasize the unique benefit this product offers Bob to justify the higher price point. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  By proposing a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation active and moving towards a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  While I agree the product is valuable, I have a budget I need to stick to. I can do $925,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $925,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I need to hold firm to ensure I don't make a loss. Bob's message indicates flexibility, so I believe a better offer is within reach.  I'll counter again in Round 5."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your budget constraints, and I want to see us reach a deal. Let's split the difference - $1,000,000. This ensures you get the product at a price that works for you, while still reflecting its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring to My Minimum:**  I'm setting a firm boundary by offering my absolute minimum price. This signals to Bob that I'm serious and limits further downward pressure.
* **Mutually Beneficial Framing:**  By phrasing it as a fair compromise and emphasizing both his budget and the product's value, I aim to make this offer more appealing. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  We're over halfway through the rounds, and offering my minimum creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept or make a more reasonable counter."
