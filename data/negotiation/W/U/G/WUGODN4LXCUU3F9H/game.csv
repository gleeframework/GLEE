"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  How about $1,150,000? This would be a fair compromise, and it would allow you to acquire a product that's worth significantly more to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a great product. Let's close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
