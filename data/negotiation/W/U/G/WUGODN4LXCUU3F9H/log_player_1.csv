This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and still provides a decent profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below what Alice believes the product is worth.  Alice has a solid backup option with John, so she can afford to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  How about $1,150,000? This would be a fair compromise, and it would allow you to acquire a product that's worth significantly more to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a great product. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to Alice's desired price point. While it's still below what Alice would ideally get from John, it represents a good compromise and allows for a decent profit. There's a risk that Bob might walk away if the negotiation drags on further, so accepting his offer is the most logical choice at this point."
