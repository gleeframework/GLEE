"I appreciate your time and consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1050000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1050000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $975000 is a fair price. I believe it's a good compromise considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $975000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a decent profit. I'm thinking of $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm at my limit. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $975000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
