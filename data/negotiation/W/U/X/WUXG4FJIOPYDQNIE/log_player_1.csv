"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, aiming for a good chunk of the potential profit.  Offering $1,150,000 leaves Bob a comfortable margin of $50,000, making it likely he'll consider the offer. 

This strategy allows me to gauge his interest while still securing a high price. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, always keeping the backup option of selling to John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still a good deal, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer gives me another round to negotiate. 

My strategy is to be assertive and demonstrate my willingness to walk away if necessary.  This will hopefully push Bob to come up in his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $1,125,000.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but am not willing to concede too much. It also keeps the pressure on Bob, as he still has a good margin of profit. 

This counteroffer maintains a balance between securing a good price and continuing the negotiation, allowing me to see if Bob is truly willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is consistent with his previous offer, and we've reached a point where there's not much room for further negotiation.  Accepting his offer at $1,100,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of potentially getting a lower price or even failing to close the deal.

While I would ideally want a higher price, the potential risks of continuing the negotiation outweigh the potential benefits. It's better to secure a good deal now than to risk losing out on the opportunity altogether."
