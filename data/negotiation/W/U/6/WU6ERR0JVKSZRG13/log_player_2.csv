"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $120, while John is asking $150. 
* **The offer is within your budget:** You are willing to spend up to $150, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $30 compared to buying from John."
