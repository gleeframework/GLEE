"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll get a lot of value out of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500. Would you be willing to consider $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us. However, $12,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise a little further and offer the product for $13,250.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair deal that allows you to get the product you need within your budget. Let's make this happen.",13250.0,Alice,5,
