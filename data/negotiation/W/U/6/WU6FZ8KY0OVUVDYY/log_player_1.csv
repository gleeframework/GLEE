Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can push him closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll get a lot of value out of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500. Would you be willing to consider $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $12,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with it. I believe I can get a better price, especially with John waiting in the wings to pay my full asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us. However, $12,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise a little further and offer the product for $13,250.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair deal that allows you to get the product you need within your budget. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $12,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,750 and $13,250. Would you be willing to consider $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob is offering $13,000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price of $15,000, I've already rejected several offers and there's a risk of Bob walking away.  It's also worth noting that John is willing to pay my full price, so I'm not losing out on a significant amount of money if I sell to Bob now.  It's a good deal for me, and it seems like Bob is sincere about getting the product.  I'll accept his offer."
