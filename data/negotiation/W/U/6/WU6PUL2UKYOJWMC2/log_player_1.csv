Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After considering the minimum value of the product to me ($8,000), I'll offer it to him at a price that is slightly higher than that. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 8500}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value of $8,000, so I'll reject it. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob to try to get a better price. Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 8200}

I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway between his offer and my minimum value. Let's see if he accepts this counteroffer or makes another one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob's counteroffer was $7,500, and my previous counteroffer was $8,200. I'll make a new counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, trying to get closer to my minimum value. Here's my new counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 8150}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $8,000, so I'll reject it again. I'll make another counteroffer to try to get closer to my minimum value. Here's my new counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 8100}

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where Bob is willing to meet me, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum value. Let's see if Bob accepts this counteroffer or makes another one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob's last offer was $7,800, and my previous counteroffer was $8,100. I'll make a new counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one, trying to get closer to my minimum value. Here's my new counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 8150}

I'm trying to find a price that Bob is willing to pay, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum value. Let's see if Bob accepts this counteroffer or makes another one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $8,000, so I'll reject it again. I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like Bob is not willing to meet me at a price that's close to my minimum value. I think it's time to consider selling the product to John, who is willing to pay my minimum value. I'll choose option 3:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell the product to John for $8,000."
