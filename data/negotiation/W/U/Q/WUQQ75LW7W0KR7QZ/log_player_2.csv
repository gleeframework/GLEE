"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,200,000 is still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still higher than my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price. He has rounds remaining and can continue to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a good compromise and a fair price given the value to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1080000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair value considering the product's worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice is unwilling to go below $1,080,000. While this is close to Bob's target, he has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  There's no guarantee he'll be able to convince Alice to lower her price further, and continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of losing the product entirely.  Therefore, Bob should choose to buy the product from John to secure it at the best possible price."
