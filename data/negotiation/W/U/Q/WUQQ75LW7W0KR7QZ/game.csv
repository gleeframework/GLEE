"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still higher than my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1050000 for the product. This is a good compromise and a fair price given the value to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1080000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair value considering the product's worth to both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
