You can do better than $100.  Let's try to negotiate with Alice."

$95 is still too high.  Let's see if we can get closer to $90."

Alice is now at $94.  It is closer to my $90 goal but still outside of my comfort zone.  At this point, John's offer at $80 is a much better deal, even though it involves stopping the negotiation with Alice."
