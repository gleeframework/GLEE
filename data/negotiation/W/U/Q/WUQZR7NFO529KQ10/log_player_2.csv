"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,080,000, which is a bit closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not comfortable exceeding my limit.  It's better to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoid any further negotiation with Alice."
