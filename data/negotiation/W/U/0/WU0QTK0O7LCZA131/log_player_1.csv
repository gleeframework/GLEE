Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your worth:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so you should never sell for less. 
* **Starting high:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Bob's perspective:**  While Bob values the product at $10,000, he may be willing to pay a premium if he believes it's a good deal or a rare opportunity.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Remember, your goal is to maximize profit, but getting a sale is better than no sale at all if Bob is completely unwilling to budge."
