"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $95. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for $85 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me right now, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $85 is a bit low, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we meet at $87? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer for $87.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, $87 is still above my minimum of $80.  It's worth closing the deal now rather than risking further negotiation and possibly ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John for $80."
