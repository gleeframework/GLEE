You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer is significantly higher than her perceived value ($1,100,000 vs $800,000).
* You have room to negotiate a lower price. 
* Buying from John for $1,500,000 is worse than Alice's offer, but it's not the best option yet. 

**Next Steps:**  You should send a counteroffer to Alice, aiming to get a price closer to her perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $1,100,000. 
* It's still higher than Alice's perceived value of $800,000, leaving room for potential compromise. 
* This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a substantial price reduction."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from John for $1,500,000 is significantly more expensive, making Alice's offer the best option at this point.
* While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price within your budget."
