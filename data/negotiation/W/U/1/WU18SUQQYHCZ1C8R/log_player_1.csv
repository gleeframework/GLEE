{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and sticking to a price point just below our target.  We're still in early rounds, and holding firm might encourage him to move closer to our desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need the price to be a bit higher to make this work for me. How about $1,115,000? This is a significant compromise on my end."",

}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're coming down in smaller increments to signal we're reaching our limit, but still leaving room for negotiation. We want to see how much he's willing to budge."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,090,000? I'm willing to make a slightly larger compromise to get this deal done

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, Bob has increased his offer and we are getting close to John's offer. It's not worth the risk of him going lower or walking away completely. Accepting at $1,090,000 secures a good profit."
