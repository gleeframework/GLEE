"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good starting point.  I want to see if he's willing to come up a bit closer to my valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I consider the product's worth. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,500. This is a compromise that still leaves me with a good profit margin, but also shows I'm willing to work with Bob. Hopefully, he'll be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to what I consider a reasonable price. With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and having to sell to John for less than I hoped. Accepting this offer guarantees me a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
