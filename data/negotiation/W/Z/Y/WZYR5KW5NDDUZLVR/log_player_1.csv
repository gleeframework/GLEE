Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, $120. I know Bob values the product at $100, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a little more to get it. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer $120,  $110 is still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum acceptable price, and it avoids the risk of Bob rejecting further counteroffers or me needing to sell to John."
