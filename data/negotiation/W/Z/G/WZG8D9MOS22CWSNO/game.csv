"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1400000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price. While $1200000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum expectation. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, how about we settle for $1300000? This price still gives you a significant benefit, and I believe we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1200000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me in the middle at $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1250000 is still a bit too low for me.  To be fair to both of us, let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $1275000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1275000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
