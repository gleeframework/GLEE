"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider a figure closer to $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I do have another offer for $1,200,000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant reduction. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your position.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, $1,450,000 is still above what I've budgeted for this purchase. To be completely transparent, I do have another offer for $1,200,000. I'd much prefer to work with you, but I'm also trying to be fiscally responsible.  Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
