Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000.  This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get at least my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but if he doesn't, I'm prepared to negotiate or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is my minimum price, I'm hoping for a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,250,000.  This is a compromise that's still above my minimum price but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground for both of us."
