Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John is a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, Alice wants to see if she can get even more from Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" helps justify the high price to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" and ""Let me know your thoughts"" signals to Bob that Alice is willing to discuss the price.

This strategy aims to balance getting the best possible price from Bob while also ensuring Alice doesn't lose the sale entirely."
