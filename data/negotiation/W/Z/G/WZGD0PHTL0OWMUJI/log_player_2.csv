{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to test the waters and see how flexible Alice is. This price is well below my maximum budget and allows for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's closer to my maximum budget. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get it lower. I believe there's still room for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,450,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a good deal. It's a compromise that could be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now within my budget, it's still higher than John's price. I believe I can still get a slightly better deal by making one more counteroffer. If Alice rejects that, I'll happily buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. It's equal to John's price, so I'm effectively saying that I'm willing to pay John's price but would prefer to buy from Alice. This puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to accept this price or let me go to John."
