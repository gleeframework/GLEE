"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $130 for it.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little too high for me.  How about $140?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it right now.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $140. I'm willing to compromise again and sell the product to you for $155. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",155.0,Alice,5,
