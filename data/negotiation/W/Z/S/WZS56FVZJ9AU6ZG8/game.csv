"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $95. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $100. That's the minimum I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you at $102.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",102.5,Alice,5,
