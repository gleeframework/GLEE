Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value that justifies this price, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Value & Alternative Option:** While John offers $10,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly is preferable to potentially lengthy negotiations with John. 

This offer balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible sale price while acknowledging the guaranteed $10,000 backup offer."
