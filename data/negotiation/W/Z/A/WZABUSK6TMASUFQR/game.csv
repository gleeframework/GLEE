"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value of this product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. My revised offer is $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at this time. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $900,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer and reflects my commitment to reaching an agreement.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for this product. This is my final offer in this range, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price for the product. $920,000 is closer to what I'm comfortable with, but I'm still slightly over budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a fair compromise, and a good midpoint between our current positions. Let's close this deal, I'm confident this is a price that we can both be happy with.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $910,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. If we can't agree on a price soon, I may need to consider other options.",915000.0,Alice,7,
