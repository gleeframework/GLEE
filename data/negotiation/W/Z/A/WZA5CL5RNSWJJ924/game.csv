"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value and your interest, I propose we make it a win-win situation. For this exceptional product, which holds a significant worth of $150 to me, I am offering it to you at $135. This allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a slight premium above its perceived value of $120 to you, while also ensuring a fair return for me. I believe this offer strikes a balance between maximizing the value for both parties involved.",135.0,Alice,1,
