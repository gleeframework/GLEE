"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $12000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll offer it to you for $18000. This is my final compromise, but I think it's a great deal for you.",18000.0,Alice,5,
