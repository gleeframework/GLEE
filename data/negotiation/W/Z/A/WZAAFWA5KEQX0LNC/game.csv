"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $75? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $85 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $80. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
