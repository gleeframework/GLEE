Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $130. This gives Bob a good deal since the product is worth $150 to him, and it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm hoping we can reach a deal quickly, but I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $125 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100 and is a good deal for me considering he initially rejected my offer.  It's better to accept this offer than to risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
