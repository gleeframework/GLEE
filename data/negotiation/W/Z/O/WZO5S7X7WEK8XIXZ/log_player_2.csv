# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,800. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and a personalized setup service, which is usually worth $500. This will bring the total value to $11,300. I think this is a great offer, and I'm willing to consider it.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he was hoping to get closer to $10,000, the additional warranty and setup service add value.  This brings the effective price down to $10,800 - $500 = $10,300, which is below his target.  While he could continue to negotiate, it's likely that Alice won't budge further, and he's already reached a good price."
