"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,200,000? This still leaves a decent margin for you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking. While $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to move up to $900,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value in the current market. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000. While that's a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
