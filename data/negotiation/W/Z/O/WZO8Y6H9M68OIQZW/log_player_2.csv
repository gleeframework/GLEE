Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,200,000? This still leaves a decent margin for you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000. While that's a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear she's still trying to get above $1,000,000. John offers a guaranteed price at your maximum budget. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice and potentially ending up with a worse outcome."
