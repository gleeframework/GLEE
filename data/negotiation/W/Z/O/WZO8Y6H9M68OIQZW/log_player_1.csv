Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to sell for such a low amount. I'll try to negotiate with him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,200,000? This still leaves a decent margin for you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking. While $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to move up to $900,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value in the current market. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough for me to sell. I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate with him, I can secure a price closer to my asking price. I'm not willing to sell to John for $1,500,000 just yet, as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000. While that's a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
