"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $7500? I think it's a fair price considering my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $8500? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8200. This is a fair compromise that keeps the price within my range and leaves you with a decent profit.",8200.0,Bob,4,
