"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. This is to leave room for negotiation while still being profitable. I believe Bob will be willing to negotiate down from this price, as he values the product at $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,500. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer.  I believe this price is within a reasonable negotiation range and gives Bob room to counteroffer if he's still interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it. We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and I'm confident that this price is fair. If he rejects it, I might consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiations and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. It's getting risky to keep rejecting and counteroffering, as I might not be able to reach a deal within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John at $12,000 is a safe and profitable option, so I'll go with that."
