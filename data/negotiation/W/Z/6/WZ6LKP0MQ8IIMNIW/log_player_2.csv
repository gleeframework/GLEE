# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by you. I'm extending this opportunity to you at an exclusive price of $135. This is a great chance to acquire a valuable item at a price that's higher than its worth to you, ensuring you get the best deal possible. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to you:** The product is worth $150 to you.
* **Alice's offer:** Alice offers the product for $135.
* **John's price:** John offers the product for $150.

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still get the product for less. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and potentially negotiating with her further or buying from another seller for a lower price would be the best course of action."
