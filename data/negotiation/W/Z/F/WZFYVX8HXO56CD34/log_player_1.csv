"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm aiming for a price that's still attractive to Bob, but gives me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum.  I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a price that gives me a decent profit.  This counteroffer should be more attractive to Bob than my initial offer, but still above his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm lowering the price again, but still aiming for a profit.  This offer is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting too close to my minimum, and I'm concerned that Bob might be stalling. With John offering $100, it's the safer bet to sell to him."
