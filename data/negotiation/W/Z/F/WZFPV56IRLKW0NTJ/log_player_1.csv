Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still not satisfied. I'd like to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}

I'm counteroffering at $16,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price will be attractive to Bob while still allowing me to get a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
