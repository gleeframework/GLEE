We're still doing well in the negotiation. Bob is clearly interested and willing to move upward.  We have time to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I can see you're serious, so I'm willing to make a significant move.  Let's close this deal right now at $1,105,000. This is a final offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1105000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is a factor:**  We're halfway through the rounds, and while we're making progress, we don't want this to drag on.  
* **Sense of urgency:** Introducing the ""other interested parties"" element adds a bit of pressure without being too aggressive.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is a final offer, we're hoping Bob recognizes we're serious and it encourages him to make a decision."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,090,000, but I really need to be at or below that number. Can you consider one last compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing returns:** While we could likely push Bob a little further, the gains would be minimal. $1,090,000 is a strong profit. 
* **""One last compromise"":** Bob's language suggests he's nearing his limit. Pushing further risks him walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Getting the deal done now avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether. 

While we always want the best possible outcome, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. $1,090,000 is a significant profit and a successful negotiation."
