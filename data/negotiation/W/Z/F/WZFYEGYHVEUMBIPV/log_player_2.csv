"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to us, we are offering it to you at an exclusive price of $950,000. We understand its worth to you is $1,000,000, and we aim to create a mutually beneficial deal. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum price of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John. There's no guarantee you'll get a better deal from Alice through further negotiation."
