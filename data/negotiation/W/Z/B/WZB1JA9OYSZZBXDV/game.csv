"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $950,000 is a significant gap from what I have in mind.  I could consider closing the deal for $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true worth of what's being offered.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
