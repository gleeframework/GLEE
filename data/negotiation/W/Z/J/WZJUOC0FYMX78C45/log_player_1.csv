Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see great value in. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $950,000."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $950,000 allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **High but Reasonable:** The price is significantly higher than your minimum ($800,000) but still a good deal for Bob, saving him $50,000. 
 
This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
