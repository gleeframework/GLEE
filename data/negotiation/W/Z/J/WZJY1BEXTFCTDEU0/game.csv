"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still willing to make a counteroffer. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1600000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1600000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1400000 for the product. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1400000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1520000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",1520000.0,Alice,5,
