Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, even exceeding the price you might have in mind. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Gauging Interest:** The $19,000 offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially uncover if he values the product higher than initially stated.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can gradually lower it, aiming for a price that's still comfortably above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening strategy. How you proceed depends on Bob's response and your negotiation skills."
