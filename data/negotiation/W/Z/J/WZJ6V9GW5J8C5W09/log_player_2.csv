"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $15,000, and Alice's offer of $12,000 is better than buying from John for $15,000.
* However, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price than $12,000.  
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $10000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000.
*  While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and ending up buying from John for $15,000 is too high.
* Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you get the product for a price you are comfortable with and avoids further negotiation."
