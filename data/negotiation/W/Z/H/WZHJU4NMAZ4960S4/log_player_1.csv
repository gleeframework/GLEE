"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired target. I believe there is room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get Bob to offer a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is still below my desired price of $1,200,000, it's a good deal considering the following:

* **Bob's commitment:**  He's stated he's willing to make a serious commitment to purchase at this price. This indicates he's likely to follow through.
* **Time is running out:** We are in round 6, and I'm running the risk of losing this deal and having to settle with John for $1,200,000.

Considering the above, accepting Bob's offer of $900,000 is a reasonable decision. It's a good deal for both of us and allows me to secure a sale relatively quickly."
