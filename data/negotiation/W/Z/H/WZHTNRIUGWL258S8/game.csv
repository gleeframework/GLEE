"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Could you do $100? It's a steal for the value you're getting!",100.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I have a budget in mind. How about $70? That's a fair compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,

"You're getting close, Bob.  How about we split the difference and say $85?  That's my final offer.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I'm willing to go up a bit, but $85 is just a tad over my budget. How about we settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,6,
