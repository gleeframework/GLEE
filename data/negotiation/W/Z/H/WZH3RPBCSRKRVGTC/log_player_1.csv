"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a fortune to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but $1,200,000 is not feasible. How about we bring the price down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $700,000 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'll see if I can get a better counteroffer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $700,000 is not in my range, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to your business. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000.  I believe this is a fair price and shows I'm serious about purchasing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I believe I can do better by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to compromise a little more, but only if we can reach a figure closer to $850,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's find common ground and get this done."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit more manageable. Would you consider $780,000?  It's a strong offer, and I'm eager to finalize this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $780,000 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $800,000. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal.  $780,000 is simply not enough for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.  Let's make this happen for $820,000.  This price is fair to both of us and allows me to move forward with a deal that's beneficial to everyone.  Let's close this deal and get the product in your hands!"", ""product_price"": 820000}
