"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,125,000? This would give you a great deal, and I'd still be able to get a fair price for my product.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about $1,092,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to commit to the deal at that price.",1092500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,092,500 is unfortunately still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $1,110,000? That's a significant discount from my original price, and it's the best I can do.  If you're serious about purchasing the product, I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.
