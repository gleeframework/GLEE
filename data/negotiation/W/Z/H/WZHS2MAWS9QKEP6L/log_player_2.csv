Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,125,000? This would give you a great deal, and I'd still be able to get a fair price for my product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,092,500 is unfortunately still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $1,110,000? That's a significant discount from my original price, and it's the best I can do.
