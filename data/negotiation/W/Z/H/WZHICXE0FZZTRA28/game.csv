"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me at this time. Would you be willing to consider $700,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant about $750,000.  How about we split the difference at $725,000?  I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price, and it's a good starting point for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $740,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price.
