"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($12,000 vs $10,000), indicating potential for negotiation.** 
* **You have a clear goal to save as much money as possible.** 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.** 

**Next Step:** You should make a counteroffer to Alice. Remember to keep your maximum budget of $15,000 in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your desired price.**  Her offer is now $11,500, which is within your budget and significantly lower than her initial offer. 
* **There's a risk in rejecting the offer:** If you reject and continue to counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. You could end up in a situation where you have to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Accepting the offer secures a good deal:** You're buying the product for less than your initial limit and saving $3,500 compared to buying from John. 

**Overall, accepting Alice's offer is the most strategically sound decision in this round.**"
