"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value for me, and still a good price for you. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also looking to save as much as I can. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm running out of time for this negotiation. This is my final offer - $9,900. It's a significant compromise on my part, but I'm confident it's a fair price given the product's value. If you don't accept, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision.",9900.0,Alice,7,
