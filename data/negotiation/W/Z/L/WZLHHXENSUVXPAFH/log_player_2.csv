Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value you place on the product, I believe a price closer to $1,100,000 would be fair for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and hopefully, we can finalize the transaction.
