# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $95. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $95 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference - how about $92.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $92.50. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, though. How about $94? It's a small step down from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $94,  which is still within Bob's maximum value of $120.
* **Better Options:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, he has already made a few counteroffers.  The risk of going further is that Alice might become less willing to negotiate, and Bob might end up buying from John at a higher price. 

Accepting this offer is the safest choice to secure the product at a price that's still within Bob's budget."
