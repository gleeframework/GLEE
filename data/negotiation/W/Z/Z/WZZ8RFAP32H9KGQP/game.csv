,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $90. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $95. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $95 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference - how about $92.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $92.50. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, though. How about $94? It's a small step down from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",94.0,Alice,5,
