"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for a special price of $110. This is a great deal, as it's worth much more to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is lower than her value for the product, you can get a better deal by buying from John for $100. Your goal is to save as much money as possible, and buying from John achieves that."
