"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $7,000.",7000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $5,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",5500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $5,500. Considering the product's value and the market conditions, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $6,200.",6200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $6,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I can only go as low as $5,800. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",5800.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $5,800 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another compromise. Considering the product's value and the market conditions, I'm willing to sell it to you for $6,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",6000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $6,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. I can go as low as $5,500, but that's my final offer. I believe this is the best price I can accept without going over my budget.",5500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go as low as $5,500. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $5,900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value and the market conditions.",5900.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your understanding, Alice, but $5,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer. I can go as low as $5,700, but that's my absolute limit. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",5700.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $5,700.

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more offer, Alice, but $5,850 is still a bit above my budget. I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to accept the product at $5,800, but that's the absolute maximum I can go. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",5800.0,Bob,10,
