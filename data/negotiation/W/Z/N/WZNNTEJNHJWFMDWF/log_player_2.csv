"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is lower than your maximum price of $1,500,000 and still allows you to make a profit (since the product is only worth $1,000,000 to Alice). Accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John."
