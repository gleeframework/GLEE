"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm sure you'll love it. I'm starting at $150, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is interested. I've also framed the message to emphasize the value of the product and create an opportunity for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, so I'm rejecting it. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130 to make this deal work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $115? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $120. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $125? It's a fair price, and it lets us both walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's only $5 away from my minimum and $10 higher than Bob's last offer. This shows good faith while also leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on $115. If we can't agree on that, I'm going to have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is being very firm on $115, and while I'm tempted to try for a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiation process. I don't want to risk losing out completely by rejecting his offer and potentially having him go with John. Selling to John for $120 is a safe bet and ensures I get my minimum price."
