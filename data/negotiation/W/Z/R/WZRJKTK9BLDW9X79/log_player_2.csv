{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $110. This is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better deal. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $115.  While this is a better offer than before, Bob can still likely negotiate a lower price and save some money.  It's worth trying another counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer is still slightly higher than Bob's target price. There are only three rounds left, and it's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price in that time. It's better to secure the product from John for $120 rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
