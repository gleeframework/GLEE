(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is back to her original price.  I've already tried to negotiate and haven't made significant progress. At this point, it's clear that she's not willing to budge much.  To avoid further rounds of negotiation with no guarantee of success, it's more efficient to buy from John, who offers a known price within my budget."
