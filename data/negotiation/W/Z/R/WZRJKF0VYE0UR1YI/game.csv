"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $22000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, which is my maximum. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $22000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $18000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18000 is still outside of my budget. I'm sticking to my offer of $8000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $16000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $16000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $8000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can find a way to make this deal work.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $8000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $8000. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $12000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
