{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping that she'll come down further.  It's possible she'll be more motivated to make a deal if she realizes I'm serious about buying from John if necessary."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are in the 9th round, and Alice's final offer is still above my budget. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  Given that I have a guaranteed option to purchase from John at $8,000, it's better to take that option and avoid further risk."
