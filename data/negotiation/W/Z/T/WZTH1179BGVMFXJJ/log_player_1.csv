"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. It's a significant discount from my minimum value, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate and encourages him to engage in the process.  I want to see if he's willing to play ball before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm not desperate to sell and I'm willing to keep negotiating. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only by $1,000.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise but still value the product highly.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing while still being close to my desired price point."
