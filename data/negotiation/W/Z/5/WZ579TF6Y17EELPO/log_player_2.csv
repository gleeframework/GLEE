"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While the product is potentially valuable, it's important to try to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target price, it's still a bit high.  Bob is very close to his maximum price point and doesn't want to overpay.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $860,000 for the product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $880,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $880,000. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still higher than Bob's target price. While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make one last counteroffer before considering buying from John. If this counteroffer fails, he can then move to John for a guaranteed deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $880,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $870,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 870000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go below $890,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $890,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still higher than Bob's target price.  Given that this is Alice's final offer and Bob has already made his own final offer, it's likely that further negotiation will be fruitless.  Rather than risk going through more rounds and potentially getting stuck at a price above his target, Bob should take the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000."
