Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $150. That's my absolute bottom line. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal."", ""product_price"": 150}

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm going to make another counteroffer, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'll probably just sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $130 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $140. If you're serious about buying this product, this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 140}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, there are only a few rounds left, and I'm not sure I can get a higher price from him.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so it's the best move at this point."
