"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's a game-changer in its field and offers unparalleled value. Given its worth to both of us, I propose an initial price of $950,000. This allows us to strike a fair deal while ensuring we both benefit from this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her, suggesting she's willing to negotiate. Rejecting her offer allows Bob to try and get a better price.  Buying from John immediately would be a worse deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Given the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to pay $800,000. This price is still a win for both of us, and ensures a smooth transaction. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I must maintain a certain level of profitability for our business. Therefore, I am unable to accept your offer of $800,000. However, I would like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This price reflects a compromise that allows for a beneficial transaction for both parties.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's a significant savings compared to buying from John, and it's closer to Bob's ideal price. Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal."
