Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $120, but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a little more. You can likely meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $135 feels more fair to me considering the value of this product. Let's split the difference."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can only go up to $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob has offered the highest price he's willing to pay.  While it's a bit below your initial goal, it's still a good deal and above your minimum price. Accepting his offer ensures you get a sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
