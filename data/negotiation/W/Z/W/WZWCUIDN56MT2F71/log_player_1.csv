Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's perfect for you. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room:**  Since the product is worth $80 to Bob, there's a potential $30 margin to work with. This price is still within that margin.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find what I need elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  However, it's still below my initial asking price, and I believe I can get closer to my target.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price.
* **John is a Safety Net:**  Having John as an alternative buyer gives me confidence to push for a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That way we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fairness:**  $102.50 is a price that is fair to both of us, as it's closer to my desired price than his offer while still being a decent deal for him.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and positive tone can help keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've looked into this further and I think $97 would be a fair price for the product. I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $97 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lower price, potentially below my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Deal:**  Selling to John for $100 guarantees a profit and a quick transaction. 

While I could try to squeeze out a couple more dollars with Bob, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and the potential for a longer negotiation process makes selling to John the most reliable and profitable option at this point."
