"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $110? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value at that price.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about $112.50? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you at this price.",112.5,Alice,5,

"Bob, I really appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $112.50. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value at that price.  I'm happy to keep discussing, but if you can't meet me there, I'm going to have to look for other buyers.",112.5,Alice,7,
