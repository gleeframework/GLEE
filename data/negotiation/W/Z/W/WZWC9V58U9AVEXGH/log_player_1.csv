Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting in the middle.
* **Avoid Insulting Bob:** Offering a price too close to $800,000 might make Bob feel insulted and less likely to engage. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob, as he represents the highest potential return."
