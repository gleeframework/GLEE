"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?  This reflects the product's significant value while still acknowledging your budget concerns.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
