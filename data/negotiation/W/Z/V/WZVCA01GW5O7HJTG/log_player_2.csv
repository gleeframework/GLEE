"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price. He has 9 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in your product but my budget is $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being interested in my product.  While $10000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  He has 7 more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still only able to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can afford.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his budget but offering a slightly higher price than his initial counteroffer. He's showing willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal. This could potentially encourage Alice to accept or at least come down further in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11250.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While there are still 5 rounds left to negotiate, Bob has already made two counteroffers and Alice hasn't budged much.  He's likely to continue to face a stalemate.  It's better for Bob to go with the guaranteed deal from John at $10,000 than to risk spending more or not getting the product at all."
