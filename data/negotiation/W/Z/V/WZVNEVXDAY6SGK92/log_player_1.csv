Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be very valuable to you.  How does a price of $130 sound?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer of $100 from John.

By offering the product at $130, you are:

* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob might try to negotiate the price down, and you have some buffer to still make a good profit.
* **Maximizing your potential profit:**  You are aiming to get closer to Bob's maximum perceived value while ensuring you get more than your minimum.

If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always counter-offer or proceed to sell to John for your guaranteed $100."
