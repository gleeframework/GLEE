"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $11,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,800. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,
