Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed offer from John, aiming higher with Bob could significantly increase your profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while still positioning the product as high-value.  
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, making Bob more likely to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  By inviting Bob's thoughts, you encourage a dialogue and potential counter-offer.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can gradually lower the price in subsequent negotiations, always keeping John's $1,200,000 offer as your absolute minimum."
