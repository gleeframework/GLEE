"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to go for a quick sale, I'm confident we can get closer to my desired price range. I'll counter with a price that's still fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which I believe is a fair price given the value of the product.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it aligns with what I could get from John.  This is a good outcome for me."
