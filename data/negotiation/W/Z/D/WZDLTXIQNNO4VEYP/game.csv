"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which I believe is a fair price given the value of the product.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
