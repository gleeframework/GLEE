Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a strong position.  You should aim higher with Bob to see if you can get a better deal.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also signals that you believe the product is worth more than its baseline value.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but emphasizes the value of the product. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob will reject a higher offer. However, since the product's value is the same to both you and Bob ($10,000), there's a good chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he sees it as something he truly wants."
