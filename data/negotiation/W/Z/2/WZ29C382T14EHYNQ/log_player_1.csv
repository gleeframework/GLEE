Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Knowing John acts as a price floor ($1,200,000), Alice aims to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate.  Even if Bob counters, Alice is likely to secure a price well above his perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit creates urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept without prolonged back-and-forth.

**Important Note:** There's a calculated risk. If Bob is a tough negotiator and Alice misjudged his willingness to walk away, she might miss out on the extra $50,000 John offers. However, the potential gain from a higher price from Bob makes this a strategically sound opening offer."
