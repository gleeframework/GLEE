"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $1200000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1350000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value while also being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I'm getting closer to my target,  $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1200000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1280000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,5,
