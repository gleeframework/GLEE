"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I recognize your assessment of the product's value, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the full potential it holds for your business. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth and allows both of us to benefit.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
