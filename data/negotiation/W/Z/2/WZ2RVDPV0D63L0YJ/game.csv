"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value to me. This is a fair price given the potential benefits it offers.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. Its unique features and market potential justify a much higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part, demonstrating my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential benefits it offers.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I recognize we're at a bit of an impasse. To move things forward, I'm willing to propose a creative solution. How about we settle on a price of $1,200,000, but I offer you a significant discount or additional benefits on a future purchase? This way, you get the product at a price point that works for you, and we can build a lasting business relationship.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to explore options, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this price fairly reflects the product's value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a middle ground to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
