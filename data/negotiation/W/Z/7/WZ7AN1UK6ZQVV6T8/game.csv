"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this deal happen.  This is still a great price for you, considering its worth to you. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $775,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
