Alice's offer:

While $160 is better than $180, it's still over my budget. I'm going to try to negotiate with Alice again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget is $140, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a fair price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $155. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer of $155 is still over my budget. It's time to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John for $120. Even though I might get a better deal if I continue negotiating, I'm willing to take the sure thing and secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
