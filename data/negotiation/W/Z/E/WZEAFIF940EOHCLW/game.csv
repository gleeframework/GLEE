"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable item that will bring you a lot of joy and benefit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,800 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both parties.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a decent profit. Let's try $9,600. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point.",9600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm trying to be fair here, but $9,600 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $9,300.  This is a reasonable compromise. If you're not willing to accept this,  I'll have to consider other options.",9300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not getting the price I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Alice,7,
