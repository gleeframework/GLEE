,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $22000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $21000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",21000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer it to you for $20500. This is my final concession, and I need to consider other options if we can't meet at this price.",20500.0,Alice,7,

"I've made it clear that $20500 is my final concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet at a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you halfway, but I need to know you're serious about buying the product. I'll offer it to you for $20000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",20000.0,Alice,9,
