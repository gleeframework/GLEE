Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll likely experience."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, Bob's higher valuation ($1,500,000) presents an opportunity for a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal ($100,000 less than his valuation), while still securing a substantial profit for Alice ($200,000 more than selling to John).
* **First-Mover Advantage:**  By framing the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency and potential loss if Bob declines.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring Bob finds the offer attractive enough to accept."
