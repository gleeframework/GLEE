Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that it's likely to be rejected. This gives me room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's $15,000, as Bob values the product at $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my minimum of $15,000 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm reducing my price a bit, but not too much. I'm still trying to get as much as I can, but I'm also acknowledging that Bob is willing to pay a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing him as a buyer. It's better to accept his offer and secure a sale at $13,000 than to risk getting nothing or selling to John for a lower profit margin."
