,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective.  However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $950,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's true worth while still offering you substantial value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence but the gap between $1,025,000 and my valuation of the product is still significant. To move things along, I'm willing to accept $1,037,500.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the absolute lowest price I can justify.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
