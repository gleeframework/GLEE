"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $110, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $120. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer of $110 is less than your maximum budget of $120 and cheaper than buying from John for $120. This saves you money while still acquiring the product."
