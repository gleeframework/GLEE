Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing profit:** I want to get as close to his valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I get a significantly higher price than John's offer.
* **Confident but not greedy:**  The message aims to be persuasive without being overly aggressive.  

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible sale price while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
