"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $1,100,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,500,000 represents the high-end value of this product, I understand your perspective. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
