I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is more than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $13,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to move."", ""product_price"": 13500}
