"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $15000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $13,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  He's aiming for a big discount, but the price is still within the range of what he's willing to pay. This sets the stage for a negotiation that could potentially lead to a favorable outcome for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $13000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to move. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise.  It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching an agreement and having to buy from John for $15,000 is now higher. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids further negotiation."
