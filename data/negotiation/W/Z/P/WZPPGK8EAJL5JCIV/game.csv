"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, my minimum price is $1,200,000, and I'm not willing to go below that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000, but I'm not flexible beyond that. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I can secure the product from John at that price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
