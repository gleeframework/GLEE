You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product for $115, which is a $5 discount. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower and I risk losing out on this deal.  It's better to accept a good offer now."
