Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm confident it would be valuable to you. I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential compromise and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he negotiates. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest. If he flat-out refuses, we know he might be very price-sensitive. If he counter-offers, it means he's interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so there's limited risk in starting high with Bob."
