"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you think the product is a bit pricey, but I have to consider my own valuation of the product. After reviewing the market and our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the market. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $980000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",980000.0,Alice,5,

I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay, considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means.",920000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go below $980000. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I need to protect my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $970000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",970000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to make another concession. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.

"Bob, I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit stuck in a loop. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $980000 again, but this time, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a comprehensive support package, which is normally valued at $50000. This brings the total value to $1030000, which is closer to my minimum price. I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not interested.",980000.0,Alice,9,
