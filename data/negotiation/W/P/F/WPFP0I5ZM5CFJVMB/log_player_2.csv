"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to us, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's start with $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget of $150. It makes sense to reject and see if we can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to pay $80. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, how about we meet at $90? This allows for a reasonable profit while still being accessible to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still within my budget and represents a compromise from her previous offer. Accepting this offer allows me to save $10 compared to buying from John."
