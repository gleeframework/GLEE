"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer, even though it's a good deal.  There's still room for negotiation to try to get the price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That way, we both get a fair price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer, and it's still within Bob's budget.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away from the deal, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a more expensive purchase."
