Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling at $80. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $80."
