"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm countering with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's a fair price that hopefully will convince Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $125 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful that I can get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering with $135. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still within a range where I feel I can make a decent profit. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal, we're getting close to the end of the rounds.  It's better to accept $122 than risk losing the deal and getting only $100 from John."
