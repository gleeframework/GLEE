Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.  I'll keep in mind that I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so I won't accept anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While I would prefer to make more money, Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John would net me the same amount, but I would rather sell to Bob if possible."
