"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to reach a reasonable price point.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,025,000. However, I'd like to propose a slight discount for a quick sale. How about we do $975,000, and I'll make a decision today?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your eagerness to close the deal, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again between our last offers. How about $1,000,000?  This is my absolute minimum, and it would be a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $995,000, but that's my final offer. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might need to explore other options if we can't come to an agreement.",995000.0,Bob,6,
