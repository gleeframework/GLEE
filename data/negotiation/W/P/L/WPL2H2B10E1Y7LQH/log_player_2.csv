Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your eagerness to close the deal, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again between our last offers. How about $1,000,000?  This is my absolute minimum, and it would be a fair price for both of us.
