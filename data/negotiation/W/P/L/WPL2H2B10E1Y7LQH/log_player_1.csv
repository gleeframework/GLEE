Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to settle for that amount just yet. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to reach a reasonable price point."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,025,000. However, I'd like to propose a slight discount for a quick sale. How about we do $975,000, and I'll make a decision today? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating for a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your eagerness to close the deal, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again between our last offers. How about $1,000,000?  This is my absolute minimum, and it would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $995,000, but that's my final offer. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might need to explore other options if we can't come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price. The pressure is on, and I'm not sure I can negotiate him up to my target.  I'd rather sell to John at my minimum price than risk ending up with a lower price from Bob."
