"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,250? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,250 is a compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $7,800 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to sell the product without sacrificing too much. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
