Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and while my asking price is $19,000, I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's valuation is significantly lower than yours and John's.  By starting high, you can gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, who's willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. This gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if his offer is acceptable or if you'd rather move on to John.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a less aggressive starting price."
