Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product is useful to me, but not *that* useful.  I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer but are still quite far apart.  While I agree the product has value, $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I could go up to $750,000.  That's a significant offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.
