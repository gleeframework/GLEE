"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a rare opportunity to own this valuable product.  Given its unique nature and significant worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to discussing further.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product is useful to me, but not *that* useful.  I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  This product is incredibly rare and offers substantial benefits.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 to find a fair deal.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but are still quite far apart.  While I agree the product has value, $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I could go up to $750,000.  That's a significant offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a long way from what I can accept. This product has garnered significant interest, and I'm confident in its value. To move things along, I'm willing to accept $1,100,000.  This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
