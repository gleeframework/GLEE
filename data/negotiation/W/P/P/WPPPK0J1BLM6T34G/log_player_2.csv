"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $15,000 to you. I'm extending this opportunity to purchase it at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is an exceptional deal considering its value and could be a great investment for you. Please let me know if you're interested in exploring this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than John's $15,000, her messaging is manipulative. She's trying to inflate the perceived value to you.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better price with Alice or exploring other options before settling for $12,000."
