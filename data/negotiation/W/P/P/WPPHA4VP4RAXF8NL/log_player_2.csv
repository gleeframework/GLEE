# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her, and she likely has room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a strong offer, the value of this product is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects a fair balance given the potential benefits you'll reap.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,050,000 is still above what Bob is willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and push for a lower price."
