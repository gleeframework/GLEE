"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's meet halfway!",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm able to pay.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
