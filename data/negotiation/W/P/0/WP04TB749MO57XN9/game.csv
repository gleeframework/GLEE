"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial proposal. This product offers immense value, and I believe a price closer to my original ask is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product.  Let's close the gap quickly. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000, but that's my final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers and propose $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment, and I want you to feel confident in your purchase.  However, my final offer of $1,275,000 stands. It represents the true value of this product and the potential returns it offers. Let me know your decision.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable with the value. I'm willing to make one final attempt to compromise and offer $1,230,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me halfway.",1230000.0,Bob,8,
