Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial proposal. This product offers immense value, and I believe a price closer to my original ask is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested.  There's room to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product.  Let's close the gap quickly. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000, but that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This counter-offer creates a sense of urgency with the ""final offer"" statement, while still leaving a small amount of room for Bob to negotiate up if he's truly motivated.  We're aiming for a quick close above $1,250,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers and propose $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now negotiating against himself, splitting the difference after we set a firm ""final offer.""  This indicates he's very interested and likely willing to go higher.  We'll hold firm for now to test his resolve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a significant investment, and I want you to feel confident in your purchase.  However, my final offer of $1,275,000 stands. It represents the true value of this product and the potential returns it offers. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're holding firm at our ""final offer"" price, reiterating its value.  By not budging, we're signaling to Bob that this is his last chance to secure the product at this price, creating a sense of urgency. He's shown a strong interest and has been incrementally increasing his offer. We believe he's likely to accept this final opportunity to acquire the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable with the value. I'm willing to make one final attempt to compromise and offer $1,230,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we were aiming for $1,275,000, Bob's latest offer is still significantly higher than John's $1,000,000 offer. It's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to meet our ""final offer"" price.  Accepting now secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in subsequent rounds."
