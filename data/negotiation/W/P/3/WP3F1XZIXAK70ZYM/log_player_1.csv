"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$120 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $175. This is still above my minimum price but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
