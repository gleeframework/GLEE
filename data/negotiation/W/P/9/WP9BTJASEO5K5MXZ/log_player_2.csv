"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, Bob has a limit of $150 and should try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore options for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to come down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $110, which is a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is closer to Bob's target, but still a bit high. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price, potentially meeting in the middle around $107.50. Rejecting allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $110 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?"", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I think I can do better than $107.50. How about we meet at $112? It's still a great value, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112 is getting closer to Bob's target, and it's worth considering.  It's still within Bob's budget, and while there's room for further negotiation, the risk of going back and forth more times increases the chance that Alice will get stubborn or Bob will run out of rounds and have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer gets Bob the product for a decent price without risking further negotiations."
