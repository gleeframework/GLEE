"Alice, your product is intriguing, but  $2,300,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,700,000.  This is my best offer, considering my limits. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting yours. I'm confident in the value this product holds, and $1,700,000 undervalues its potential. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly. However, $2,000,000 is still too much for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,800,000, which is a significant compromise.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to move this deal forward.  I believe this offer reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm determined to acquire this product, but $1,900,000 is still pushing my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,850,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's close this transaction.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
