"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm not comfortable going below $9000.  Let's meet in the middle. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting a good deal. While $8500 is still a bit below what I'd like, I'm willing to make one last concession.  I'll take $8750 for the product.  Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth anymore.",8750.0,Alice,5,
