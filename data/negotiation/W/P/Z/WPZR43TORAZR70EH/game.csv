"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. ",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit far off. I'd be willing to pay $880,000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",880000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $880,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more.  How about we split the difference and settle on $940,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go up to $940,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $880,000 and $900,000, so I'd be willing to pay $890,000 for the product. Can we agree on that price?",890000.0,Bob,6,
