Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  Bob's offer of $890,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident that further negotiation will lead to a better outcome.  John is willing to pay my full asking price, so it's the best option for me right now."
