"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,000. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $8,200. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go below $8,000, and you have a guaranteed offer from John at that price."
