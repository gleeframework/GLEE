"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
