Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price,  $550000 is significantly below the value I've determined for this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $700000. This price still reflects the product's significant potential and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's continue this conversation to find a solution that works for both of us.
