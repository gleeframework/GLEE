Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Strong Value Proposition:**  The message highlights the product's value, subtly justifying the price.
* **Backup Option:** You have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $12,000, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed."
