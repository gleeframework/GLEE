"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that I know you'll find highly beneficial. My initial price is $900,000. I believe this represents a fair value considering the product's worth to you.  Let's discuss further! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""message"": ""Alice, while I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 as a starting point.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep working towards a successful deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
