"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find immensely valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations slightly above your desired price point. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value your product highly. 
* **Leaving Room for Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, we want to secure a deal that maximizes our profit. By starting at $1,400,000, we leave space for potential counteroffers while still aiming for a significant gain.
* **Professionalism:** The message is framed positively and emphasizes the product's value, setting a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I believe that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is significantly below our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). While we want to secure a deal with Bob, accepting this offer would result in a loss. We are better off negotiating further or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is considerably below what I believe the product is worth. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our initial offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,100,000). This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price that secures a substantial profit.
* **Reiterating Value:** We subtly remind Bob of the product's value by stating that his offer was ""considerably below"" our assessment. This reinforces that we're not willing to make significant concessions. 
* **Seeking Agreement:** By suggesting we're looking for a ""middle ground,"" we maintain a collaborative tone and encourage Bob to engage in a meaningful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches our minimum acceptable price. While we could try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that further negotiation rounds won't yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting this offer secures a solid profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
