"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that I know you value at least $120, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in paying $110 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer of $110 is less than your maximum budget of $120 and saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
