Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make one more counteroffer, $17,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market price I can get it from John for $15,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting too low. He's using the knowledge of your guaranteed sale to John for $15,000 to leverage a better price for himself.  At this point, any further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price significantly higher than $17,000. It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
