"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. I'm interested in the product, but I'm not able to go that high at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  Let's meet in the middle.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. $13,000 is a bit more than I can afford at this time.  I'm willing to go up to $12,750.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you think?",12750.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,750. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $13,250. This is the lowest price I can offer, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,7,
