"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still making a profit. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, I believe he might be willing to pay a little extra for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm lowering my price to $13,000, which is still a decent profit for me. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away."
