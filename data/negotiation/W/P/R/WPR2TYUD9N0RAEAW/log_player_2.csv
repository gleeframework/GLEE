"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $12,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $14,000. This is a price I am not willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's $3,000 lower than Alice's initial price. This is a significant reduction, but it's still within a range that I believe might be acceptable to Alice, considering her minimum value is $12,000.  We have 10 rounds to negotiate, so starting with a strong counteroffer gives me room to adjust if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $13,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I believe there's still room for negotiation, so I'm going to reject the offer and try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, and I've also lowered my counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, and we're getting closer. $11,500 is still within my budget and a fair compromise considering I'm willing to pay up to $12,000. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  I have several rounds left, and I believe I can still get a slightly better deal. By rejecting the offer, I can continue to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,500, which is only $500 above my maximum willingness to pay. I'm going to make a counteroffer of $12,250, which is right in the middle of our current positions. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still hoping for a small discount. With only a few rounds left, I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."
