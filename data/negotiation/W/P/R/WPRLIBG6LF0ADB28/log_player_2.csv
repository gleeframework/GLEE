"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to me, but I know it's even more valuable to someone like you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Alice's offer of $11,500 is too high. You can get the product for $12,000 from John, but you should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
