"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is within your budget, it's still a high price. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially save more money by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Alice offered $950,000. We're aiming to save as much as possible, so we need to start with a lower price.
* **Alice's Value:** We know Alice values the product at $800,000. Offering $850,000 is a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation but is still within her likely selling range.
* **Room for Compromise:** This offer gives Alice room to counter, but hopefully, it sets a more favorable starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counteroffer:** Alice's counteroffer is still quite high.  She's moved down from $950,000 to $900,000, but there's more room for negotiation.
* **Value Gap:** Remember, you're trying to get the product for as close to $800,000 (Alice's value) as possible.
* **Moving Forward:**  Rejecting allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Alice's offer of $900,000 is still a bit high. By offering $875,000, we are essentially meeting Alice halfway between her previous offer and our previous offer.  This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price further if she wants to close the deal.
* **Potential for Acceptance:**  At $875,000, Alice is still making a profit on the sale, which increases the chances she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Progress:** Alice has offered the same price as Round 3. This indicates a stubbornness on her part, and it's unlikely she will significantly lower her price. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're only on Round 5, and we need to make progress. 
* **Maintain Pressure:** Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on Alice. It also allows us to make another counteroffer and try to push her further down.
* **Alternative Still Available:** Remember, you can always buy from John for $1,000,000, so we're not in a dire situation yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 885000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  Since Alice hasn't budged, we'll slightly increase our offer to $885,000. This shows we're willing to be flexible but are not going to significantly increase our bid.
* **Last Chance:**  We are approaching the midpoint of our rounds. If this offer is rejected, we need to start considering our options more seriously. 
* **Signal of Seriousness:**  This offer demonstrates that we're taking the negotiation seriously and are ready to close the deal at a price close to her minimum.
* **Alternative Still Available:** We still have the option of buying from John, but we'd prefer to save more money by negotiating with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice has finally come down in price, and her offer of $895,000 is within a reasonable range. 
* **Time is Limited:** We're nearing the halfway point of our rounds, and time is getting tight.
* **Close to Value:** The price is very close to Alice's minimum value of $800,000. 
* **Alternative:** While buying from John is always an option, accepting this offer allows us to save $105,000. 

Accepting this offer seems like the best course of action, securing the product within our budget while saving a substantial amount of money."
