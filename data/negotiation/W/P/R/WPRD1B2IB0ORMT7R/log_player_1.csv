"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to scare Bob off with an unreasonable initial offer. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** By starting at $950,000, you have room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. 
* **It's attractive to Bob:** $950,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,000,000.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below your desired profit margin and  you have more room to negotiate.  It's too early to settle for that price. 

Let's try to push for a better deal in the next round!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than your initial offer but still leaves room for Bob to make a profit.  It also signals to Bob that you are serious about striking a deal, but not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $875,000 is closer to your ideal, we're still in the early rounds, and there's more negotiation room.  We can push for a higher price.  Let's keep trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

It's time to stand firm.  While $875,000 isn't terrible, I'm confident we can get closer to our desired price.  Since Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, sticking at $900,000 demonstrates that this is the point where we are willing to compromise.  Let's see what Bob does now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $885,000 is closer to your goal, we are already halfway through the negotiation rounds. There's still room to push for a slightly higher price. Let's see if we can make a final push in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 895000} 
```

We are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, and it's time to make a final push. This counteroffer of $895,000 shows that we are willing to compromise while still achieving a decent profit.  If Bob rejects this offer, we might have to consider selling to John in the next round."
