"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than her product's value to her ($1,000,000), so there's room for negotiation.  It's beneficial to try and get a better price, especially since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for it.  A counteroffer will give you a chance to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value for it and the potential benefits it brings to me. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the potential benefits it brings. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is at $1,150,000, which is a better price than her initial offer of $1,200,000 and still within my budget.  Since I can get it for less than what I'm willing to pay from John, it makes sense to accept and secure the product."
