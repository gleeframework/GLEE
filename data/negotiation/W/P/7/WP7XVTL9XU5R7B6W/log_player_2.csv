"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I suggest we start negotiations at $100. This is a fair price considering the $120 value you see in it, and it allows us both to be satisfied with the transaction. Please let me know if this proposal works for you, or if you'd like to discuss other terms. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's starting price is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product ($100 vs. $80). 
* You have a viable alternative in John, who will sell the product for $120. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay such a high price. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price in a counter-offer, giving you a chance to save even more."
