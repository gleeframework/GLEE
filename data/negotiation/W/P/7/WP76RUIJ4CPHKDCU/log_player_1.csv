Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more. 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** This encourages Bob to negotiate but also signals that you value the product highly.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a significant difference between your offer and Bob's estimated value, leaving space for a counteroffer.
* **Balance:** The offer isn't so high that Bob immediately rejects it, but also leaves room for you to potentially earn more. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's response:**  If he rejects, we'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer.
* **Consider John's offer:**  Keep in mind that John is willing to pay $800,000, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $1,100,000 is better than John's offer, Bob's valuation of the product at $1,500,000 suggests there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and the potential to earn closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Time Factor:**  We haven't been given any information on time constraints, so there's no urgent need to accept an offer that's potentially suboptimal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** We'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  A strategic counteroffer will likely fall between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000, aiming to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer falls right between your previous offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $1,100,000.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and move toward a mutually agreeable price.
* **Reasonable Increment:** The $50,000 increase from Bob's offer shows that you're still negotiating, but also signals that you're not willing to drop your price significantly further. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Bob to potentially raise his price.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's response:**  We'll need to analyze Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, we'll need to decide on a new strategy.
* **Consider John's offer:**  Remember, John is still a viable option at $800,000.  If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, we'll need to consider if John's offer becomes more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:**  While $1,050,000 is better than John's offer, it's getting closer to that price point.  It's not a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's initial valuation suggests he's willing to pay more. It's still worth pushing for a higher price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer allows for another counteroffer, potentially bringing Bob closer to a price we're both comfortable with.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  We need to decide on a counteroffer to Bob.  A reasonable counteroffer might be slightly higher than $1,050,000, but significantly less than $1,150,000, demonstrating flexibility without conceding too much.
* **Consider John's Offer:** Keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  This counteroffer is only $25,000 higher than Bob's last offer. It demonstrates flexibility while showing that you're still willing to negotiate. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This small increment tests if Bob is willing to increase his offer just a bit more. It avoids a large gap that might make him walk away.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:** The counteroffer remains significantly higher than John's $800,000 offer, making it still more desirable than selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's response:** If Bob accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, we'll need to consider whether to continue negotiating with him or accept John's offer.
* **Evaluate John's Offer:** If Bob continues to reject our offers, John's offer becomes increasingly appealing as it provides a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Decreasing Returns:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to John's offer, and the difference is becoming less significant.  
* **Negotiation Stall:**  Bob has consistently rejected offers, indicating that he may not be willing to move much higher.  
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees a sale at a price that's still significantly higher than your minimum.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept John's Offer:**  John's offer provides a secure and guaranteed sale, and continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of not reaching a deal.
* **Exit Strategy:** This decision ensures a sale and allows us to move on from this negotiation."
