Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $18,000 is still below my desired profit margin. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}

While $17,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll see if I can push Bob further in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still hoping to get a bit more than $17,000. I'll see if I can push Bob further in the next round.  I'm getting a little nervous about running out of rounds though."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

I'm getting a little worried about running out of time, so I'm going to meet Bob in the middle again.  I'm willing to lower my price to $17,500, but this is my final offer.  If he rejects it, I'm going to sell to John."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting very close to the wire, and I'm not confident Bob will come up to my desired price.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John. It's not ideal, but it's better than risking getting nothing."
