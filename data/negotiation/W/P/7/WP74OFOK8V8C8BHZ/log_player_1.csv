Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This leaves a good profit margin for me while still being attractive to Bob, as it's significantly lower than his perceived value. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential value for Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Get the negotiation started:** A clear offer encourages Bob to engage.
* **Set a high starting point:**  $12,000 is a strong opening point, giving me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Appeal to Bob's rationality:**  By emphasizing his potential gain, I'm encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.

I'm ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, potentially lowering the price if necessary, but always keeping my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer.

* **Reasoning:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to $11,000 or $10,000.  $9,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, and I want to see if I can close the gap a bit more.
* **Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hopefully closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a great deal, considering you value the product at $15,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $10,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Message:** I'm remaining positive and emphasizing the win-win situation while still asserting my desired price point.  
* **Strategy:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer will incentivize Bob to accept, but I'm ready to adjust if he rejects. My goal is to find a middle ground that's both profitable for me and appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's counteroffer of $9,750 is close enough to my desired range that it's worth accepting. 

* **Reasoning:**  
    * Accepting this offer gives me a profit significantly higher than selling to John.
    * Further negotiation might result in a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away or further haggling could lead to a lower final price.

* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential for a higher price is outweighed by the certainty of a decent profit and avoiding further negotiation."
