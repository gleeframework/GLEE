Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without scaring him off. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing within a range profitable for me.
* **Alternative Option:** I have a safety net with John ($10,000), so I'm not desperate and can afford to aim high with Bob."
