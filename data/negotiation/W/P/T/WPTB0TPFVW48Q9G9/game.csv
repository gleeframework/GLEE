"Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is an exceptional value considering its worth to you is $10,000. I believe this offer strikes a good balance between providing you with a great deal and ensuring we receive a fair return for our product.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of that, I would like to offer the product to you for $8,200. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while offering you a competitive price.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $8,200 is closer, but I'm still a little ways off. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. Considering your offer, I propose we meet halfway between $7,500 and the original $9,500 offer, which would be $8,500. This would allow us to retain a fair profit margin while being more accommodating to your budget.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise.  While your idea of meeting halfway is fair, maybe we could meet a little closer to my last offer.  Would you be willing to do $7,800?",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Bob. I understand your position and would like to extend a counteroffer of $8,000 for the product. This aligns closely with your most recent proposal and provides a fair outcome for both parties.",8000.0,Alice,7,
