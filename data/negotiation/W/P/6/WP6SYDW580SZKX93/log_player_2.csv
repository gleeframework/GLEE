{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,000,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while leaving room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm serious about the deal. This counteroffer is a compromise, hoping to meet Alice halfway while staying within my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.

Alice's counteroffer is still above my budget. While it's closer to my maximum, I'm not willing to pay that much yet. I have several rounds left, and I can still try to negotiate a lower price. I'm also aware that I have the option of buying from John for a lower price, which keeps me motivated to continue negotiating."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  However, $975,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to pay $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm again increasing my offer, showing that I'm serious about closing the deal.  $925,000 is still within my budget and closer to my target price of $800,000.

The language emphasizes my desire for a win-win situation and a successful outcome for both of us."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $950,000 is still above my budget. While I've been able to negotiate down from her initial price, I'm not willing to go any higher.  Since I have the option to buy from John for $800,000, which is within my budget and a better deal for me, I'll take that option."
