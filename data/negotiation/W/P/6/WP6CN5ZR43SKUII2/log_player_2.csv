Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial price. This offer is still very advantageous for you, considering the product's potential value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still better off trying to negotiate further.  There's still room for a lower price, and I can potentially save more money by rejecting this offer and making a new counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While $900,000 is closer to where I want to be, I'm still looking for a better price.  I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This offer reflects a compromise on both our ends and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still within my budget and have several rounds remaining.  I'm confident I can negotiate a price closer to $875,000, so rejecting this offer and making a new counteroffer is the best strategy."
