"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  That's a fair price, and I'm sure we can finalize this deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
