"Alice, thanks for the offer! Your product seems great, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $11,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm counteroffering at $11,250. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
