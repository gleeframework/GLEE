"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and your willingness to sell. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to reach a fair price. Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's try to close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $1,250,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to reach a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
