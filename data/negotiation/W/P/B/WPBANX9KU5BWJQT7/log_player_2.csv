"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. It's close to my maximum budget, and I want to see if I can negotiate a better price.  I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and your willingness to sell. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to reach a fair price. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'll reject her offer again and see if I can get her down further. I still have a few rounds to work with and want to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $1,250,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to reach a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer and is now within my acceptable range. While I could continue negotiating and try to get a slightly lower price, the risk is that she will reject my offer again, and I might end up buying from John at a higher price.  

This offer is a good compromise, and I'm comfortable accepting it to avoid potential further delays and the risk of a higher price."
