"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Could we settle on something closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to accept, but $975,000 is still a bit short. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
