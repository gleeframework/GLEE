"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
