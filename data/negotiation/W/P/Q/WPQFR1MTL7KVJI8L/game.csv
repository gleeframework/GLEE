"Bob, I have a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $15000. I know this is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself in the long run.  If you're interested, please let me know. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers.",15000.0,Alice,1,
