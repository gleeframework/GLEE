Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,100,000.  This leaves room for negotiation, but still allows me to earn significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate, knowing the product is worth $1,200,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than my minimum, it's still far below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial offer of $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would like to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $950,000 is a fair compromise. It's significantly more than my minimum of $800,000 and is close enough to my desired price point. I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
