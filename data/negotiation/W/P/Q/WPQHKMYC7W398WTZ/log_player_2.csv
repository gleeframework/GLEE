"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $170. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $170 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($120) and what John is offering ($120).  It's highly unlikely Alice will accept an offer below her valuation of $150, but it's worth negotiating down from $170."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is a starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility. While it's unlikely she'll accept $100, it leaves significant room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is respectful while clearly stating the offer is too high.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer helps understand how low Alice might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $140? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating, but $140 is still above your maximum budget and what John offers. There's room to negotiate further down towards your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to do $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to meet Alice closer to the middle ground between her last offer ($140) and your previous offer ($100). 
* **Staying Below Budget:** $110 keeps you below your $120 maximum while still leaving a small margin for a potential final compromise. 
* **Testing the Water (Again):** This offer will give you a clearer indication of how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $130? It's still a great value, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Alice has indicated this is her final concession, and $130 is still above both your budget and John's offer.
* **John is a guaranteed better deal:**  You can buy the product for $120 from John, ensuring you save money and avoid further negotiation with uncertain results.  

At this point, continuing with Alice carries the risk of her sticking to $130 or you overpaying in a final compromise. John offers a secure, budget-friendly alternative."
