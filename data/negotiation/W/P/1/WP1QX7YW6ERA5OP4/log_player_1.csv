"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still outside my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $92.50 is a good deal. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price ($100) and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
