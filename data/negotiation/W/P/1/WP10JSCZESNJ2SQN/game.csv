"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down Alice, I appreciate that.  I'm getting closer, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I can do $9,000, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
