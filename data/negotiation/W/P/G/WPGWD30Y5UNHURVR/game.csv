"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $825,000,  which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $825,000 is still too high.  I'm prepared to offer $780,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good starting point for reaching a deal.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $780,000 is still a little below what I'm hoping for.  Let's meet in the middle at $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
