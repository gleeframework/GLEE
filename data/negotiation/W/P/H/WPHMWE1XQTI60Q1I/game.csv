"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the market value. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and leaves us both with a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,700,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and what I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position, and I'm willing to make this work. How about $1,825,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,825,000 and $1,700,000, which would be $1,762,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1762500.0,Bob,6,
