"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and I still get a decent return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a counteroffer that is closer to his desired price point while still showing a willingness to compromise. $12,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it leaves some room for both parties to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $12500 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13250? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit while staying within your budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,250 is still above Bob's budget. Although it's closer to his target price, Bob still has the option of buying from John for $12,000, which is the best possible price for him. By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and attempt to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $13,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,750. This would be a fair price, and would allow us to both reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $12,750. This shows his willingness to negotiate but remains below his maximum budget.  It's a strategic move to see if Alice is willing to close the deal at a price that is still favorable for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement.  While $12750 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference â€“  I'm willing to sell it to you for $13000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Although the negotiation is getting closer to his desired price, Bob has a better option available to him.  John is offering the product for $12,000, which is the best possible price for Bob.  Therefore, it makes sense to buy from John and finalize the deal."
