Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  I think that's a fair offer considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $700,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for you to profit. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4

Round 6

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we are getting close to running out of rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
