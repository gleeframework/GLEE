Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $950,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both recognize in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
