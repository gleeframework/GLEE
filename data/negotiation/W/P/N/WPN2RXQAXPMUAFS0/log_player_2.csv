Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is within my budget. While I'd prefer to pay the $800,000 I initially offered, there's a risk that if I reject this offer, Alice might counter with a higher price again or might even decide to stop negotiating altogether. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
