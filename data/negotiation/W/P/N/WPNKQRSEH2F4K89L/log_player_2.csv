"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum price point of $8,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value you see in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range considering the product's worth to Bob.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price point of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go above my budget. I'll continue to counter-offer in hopes of reaching a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a stretch for me. How about $8,500?  That's a significant discount from your initial offer, and it's the highest I can go right now."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's price but staying within Bob's budget. It also emphasizes the value proposition for Alice, highlighting the discount from the initial offer."
