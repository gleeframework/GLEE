"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value you see in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a stretch for me. How about $8,500?  That's a significant discount from your initial offer, and it's the highest I can go right now.",8500.0,Bob,4,
