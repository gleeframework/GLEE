"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $7000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both room to make a deal. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $8500 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
