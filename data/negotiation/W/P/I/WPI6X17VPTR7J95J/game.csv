"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $6,000 is quite low, but I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price and shows I'm serious about buying.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I could move down a bit further, but $7,000 is too low for me.  Could you meet me at $9,000? This is a significant discount from my original offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting close! I can tell you're serious about finding a buyer. How about $7,500? That's a big jump from my last offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,6,
