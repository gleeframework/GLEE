"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects its true value and potential for you.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount and reflects its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,200,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the unique value proposition this product offers.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've been giving this some thought, and to get this deal done I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,500,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the value of the product to me. If we can't come to an agreement on this, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
