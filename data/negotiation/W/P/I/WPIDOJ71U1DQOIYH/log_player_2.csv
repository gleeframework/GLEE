Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,200,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the unique value proposition this product offers.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,900,000?

I'm going to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. While $1,700,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'll make one more counteroffer and see if we can reach a deal.  If not, I'll just buy from John."
