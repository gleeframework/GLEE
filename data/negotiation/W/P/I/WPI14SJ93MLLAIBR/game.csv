"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $8,250? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident it's a good deal for you.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,500. I can do $8,375, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",8375.0,Alice,5,
