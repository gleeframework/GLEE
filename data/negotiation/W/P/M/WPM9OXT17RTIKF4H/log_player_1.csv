"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for the best possible profit. I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, so I'm offering it for $10,000, hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than selling to John for $8,000, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this is a sweet spot that Bob will find appealing while still leaving me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I believe there's still some wiggle room for negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm going to try one more time with a slightly lower counteroffer.  $8,500 is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's latest offer. If he rejects this, I'll be ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm no longer confident I can get a better price from Bob. He's clearly holding firm at $7,500, and I don't want to risk another round of negotiation. I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's not ideal, but it's the best option to secure a sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
