"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $750,000, which is a fair compromise given its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still finding it hard to justify that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $675,000? I'm eager to make a deal and believe this would be mutually beneficial.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $675,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to go down to $700,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal happen.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $687,500? This seems like a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal.",687500.0,Bob,6,
