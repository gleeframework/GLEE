"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a significantly lower offer ($70) than Alice's asking price ($95). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal. 
* **Not Insulting:** While low, $70 is still a reasonable amount above Alice's perceived value of the product ($80). It doesn't completely lowball her. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message is polite and expresses interest in the product, fostering a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $85?  It's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved closer to our desired range, $85 is still above our target price. We have time and room to negotiate further. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting this offer, we signal to Alice that we're serious about getting a better price and are willing to walk away if necessary. This can encourage her to make more significant concessions in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a price I'm comfortable with."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving our offer up in smaller increments ($70 -> $75), showing Alice we're willing to negotiate but still aiming for a lower price.
* **Firm but Fair:**  We're staying firm around the $75 mark, signaling this is a price point we're serious about. 
* **Clear Communication:**  We're clearly stating $75 is a price we're ""comfortable with"", indicating it's a strong offer from our side."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $75 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $80.  This is a good price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Alice's Value:** Alice has come down to $80, which is her perceived value for the product. It's unlikely she'll go lower.
* **Within Our Budget:** $80 is within our $100 budget, and a $20 saving from John's offer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could make Alice pull out, forcing us to buy from John at the higher price."
