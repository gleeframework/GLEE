"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your desired price point. You can definitely do better than that. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially secure a better price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 is above your budget, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget.  You can try to negotiate further to get closer to your target price.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, it makes sense to keep trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering the value to me and your desired price.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $12,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your budget. While you could try to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee that she'll budge further, and you're already nearing your maximum price limit. At this point, it's more advantageous to secure the product from John for $10,000.  It's a guaranteed deal that saves you $2,750 compared to Alice's final offer."
