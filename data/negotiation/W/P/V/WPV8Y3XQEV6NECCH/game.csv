"I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $8,500? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $8,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're still very interested in the product. I'm also very interested in finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference on our last offers, and I'll do $8,000?  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'm prepared to move on to another buyer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
