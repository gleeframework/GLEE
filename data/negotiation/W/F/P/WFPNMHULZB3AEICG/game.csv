"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you be willing to consider $1200000? I believe that's a fair price, given the potential of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1200000 is a fair offer, it's a bit lower than I'd hoped to achieve for this unique product. I'm willing to compromise slightly.  My counteroffer is $1350000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for both of us to have a successful deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1350000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price to make this deal work for me.  Would you consider $1300000? I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
