"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you reaching out.  $175 is a bit out of my budget right now. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I'm really interested in the product, but I just can't go higher than that.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $125 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $150, which is the lowest I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal!",150.0,Alice,3,
