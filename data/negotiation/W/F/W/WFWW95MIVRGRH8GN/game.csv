"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm very interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $1050000, but I need to let you know that I've had other interested buyers and I'm not sure how long I'll be able to hold onto this deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
