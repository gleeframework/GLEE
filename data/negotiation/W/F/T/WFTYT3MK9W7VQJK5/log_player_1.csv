I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range that might be acceptable.  I want to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work out a better deal. How about $95 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $100, so I'm going to reject it. I will attempt to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
