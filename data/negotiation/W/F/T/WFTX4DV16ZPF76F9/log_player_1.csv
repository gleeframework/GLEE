Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $10,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as the product is worth at least that to me.  Since I have another buyer willing to pay $10,000, there's no incentive for me to lower my price unless Bob is willing to come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $7,000, it's far below what the product is worth to me. I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price with a counteroffer, or even sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than what Bob offered. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $6,500 is simply too low. It's far below my minimum acceptable price, and I don't see any reason to continue negotiating with him. I'm confident John will buy the product for my asking price, so I'm going to sell to him."
