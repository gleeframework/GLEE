Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and am happy to start the price at $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm confident in the value of this product and could go down to $135. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget and close to his initial counteroffer. Accepting this offer secures the product for a price that's significantly lower than John's, making it the most financially beneficial option."
