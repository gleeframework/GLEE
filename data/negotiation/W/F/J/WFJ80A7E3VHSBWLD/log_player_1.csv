Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,800,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe it undervalues the unique advantages this product offers.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I still think $2,000,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob has signaled this is his final offer, and while it's not the $2,000,000 I aimed for, $1,900,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. It's better to secure the deal now than risk him walking away in later rounds."
