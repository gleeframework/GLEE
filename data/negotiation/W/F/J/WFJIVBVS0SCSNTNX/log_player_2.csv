"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Bob values the product at $15,000 and can get it from John for that price. Alice's offer of $14,000 saves Bob $1,000. 
* **Rejecting the offer is not optimal:**  Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob has to buy from John at a higher price, which is not in his best interest."
