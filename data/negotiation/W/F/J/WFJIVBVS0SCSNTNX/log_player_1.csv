I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good price for both of us: 

* It's significantly higher than my floor price of $8,000, meaning I get a good profit.
* It's still lower than the value Bob places on the product ($15,000), so he can potentially make a good deal as well. 

This offer provides a good balance between maximizing my potential earnings while still being attractive to Bob."
