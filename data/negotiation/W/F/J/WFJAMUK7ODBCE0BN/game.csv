,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth. Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, $775,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's try $825,000.  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. ",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm seeing your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate that. How about we meet in the middle again at $800,000? This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
