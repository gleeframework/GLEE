Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.

I'll reject Bob's offer. $700,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, $775,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's try $825,000.  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. "", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm seeing your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate that. How about we meet in the middle again at $800,000? This seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting my minimum price, and Bob seems happy with the deal. There's no point in risking further negotiation when I can secure a sale at my desired price."
