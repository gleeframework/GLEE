"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
