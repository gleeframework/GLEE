"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value item. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $10,000, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",13000.0,Alice,5,
