"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I consider a fair price. How about we split the difference and go with $1,450,000? This still allows you to acquire the product at a good price, and it's closer to the value I'm seeking. Let me know if you're open to that.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. Can you meet me at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's compromise once more. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal.  Let me know your final decision.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,375,000 is still not within my budget. I'm afraid I have to stick with my previous offer of $1,300,000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,500,000.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
