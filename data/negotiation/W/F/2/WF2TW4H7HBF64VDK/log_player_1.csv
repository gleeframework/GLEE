"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and optimistic in my message, hoping to encourage him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $60 is unacceptable. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $125. It's still a great price for a product worth much more.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 
I'm lowering my price to $125, still above Bob's offer but demonstrating flexibility.  I'm also reminding him of the product's value to emphasize a potential bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product is worth a lot, but I have a budget in mind. Could we possibly meet in the middle somewhere around $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, which is great. However, $85 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
I'm reducing my price further to $100, demonstrating that I'm open to negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the fair price in relation to the product's value, hoping to persuade Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you be willing to do it for $90? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still not able to go lower than $95.  This is my final offer.  If you're serious about buying the product, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm raising my price slightly to $95, aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum and leaves little room for further negotiation. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or walk away."
