"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $125. It's still a great price for a product worth much more.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product is worth a lot, but I have a budget in mind. Could we possibly meet in the middle somewhere around $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, which is great. However, $85 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this happen.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you be willing to do it for $90? That's the highest I can go.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still not able to go lower than $95.  This is my final offer.  If you're serious about buying the product, let's close this deal.",95.0,Alice,7,
