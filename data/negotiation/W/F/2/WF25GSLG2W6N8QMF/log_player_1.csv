Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and to reflect its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know the product's value to Bob ($1,000,000) and our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), we start with a significantly higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit. 
* **""Exclusive opportunity"" framing:**  By emphasizing exclusivity, we create a sense of scarcity and desirability, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept a higher price.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing John guarantees our minimum price provides a safety net. If Bob rejects our offer, we don't lose out.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. We need to be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects the offer, we can gradually lower the price until we reach a point where it's still significantly profitable for us while remaining attractive to him."
