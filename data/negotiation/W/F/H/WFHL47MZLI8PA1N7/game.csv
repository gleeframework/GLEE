"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but that price is a little high for me right now.  How about we bring it down to $650,000 and see if we can make something work?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, $650,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  I'm getting closer to what I can make work.  Could you do $750,000? That would be a deal for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about making a deal. However, $750,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $850,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
