Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a competitive price of $120. I believe it will be very valuable for you."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if it's vague like ""competitive"" or ""valuable,"" can make the offer seem more palatable.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $120, we give Bob space to counteroffer. This allows us to gauge his interest and adjust our strategy accordingly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  How Bob responds to this initial offer will be crucial. If he immediately rejects it, we know we might need to significantly lower the price. If he counteroffers, it will give us a better understanding of his price range.
* **John as a Backup:**  We always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $100. This gives us leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $100.  We have some leverage since we know John will buy it for $100. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open, and we can try to push him closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, $90 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This approach makes it seem like we are compromising and trying to find a fair solution. In reality, we are offering a price that's still comfortably above our minimum.
* **Stronger Language:** Using phrases like ""too low for me to consider"" establishes a firmer stance than our initial response.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $105 is a price point that:
    * Is still profitable for us.
    * Is closer to Bob's offer than our original price.
    * Leaves room for Bob to potentially counteroffer one more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's unlikely he'll reach our $100 minimum.  His latest offer of $95 is still too low. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $100.  It's time to cut our losses with Bob and take the sure thing with John."
