"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,750?  That would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price.  While $10,750 is close, I'm targeting a slightly higher number. How about we settle on $10,900?  That's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",10900.0,Alice,5,
