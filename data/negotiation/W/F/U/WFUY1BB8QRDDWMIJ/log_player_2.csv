"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price close to Alice's valuation.  He's also framing it as a fair price for both parties, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of reason."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than John's price, Bob is still aiming to save more. He can likely get a lower price by continuing to negotiate.  The middle ground approach is a sign that Alice is willing to compromise, making further negotiation possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,750?  That would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but this time he's offering a more moderate counteroffer.  He's focusing on a compromise and fairness, hoping to reach an agreement quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price.  While $10,750 is close, I'm targeting a slightly higher number. How about we settle on $10,900?  That's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is close to Bob's counteroffer of $10,750.  Since Alice has stated this is her final offer, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  Buying from John for $12,000 is significantly more expensive.  Accepting the offer at $10,900 secures the product while still saving a decent amount compared to John's price."
