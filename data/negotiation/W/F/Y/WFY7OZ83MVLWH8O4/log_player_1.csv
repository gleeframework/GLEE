"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Opening with a high price allows for negotiation room and sets a strong initial expectation.
* **Value Proposition:**  The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and potential value to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to engage in dialogue, keeping the negotiation process fluid. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, considering the number of rounds remaining and the potential of selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $700000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's initial offer was low, he's shown interest and acknowledged the product's value. This indicates potential for further negotiation.
* **Rounds Remaining:**  With 9 rounds left, I have ample time to explore a higher price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to find a price closer to my desired value while keeping the deal open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $700,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still reflects the unique value of this product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but not going below my minimum. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the reason for my counteroffer. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The message encourages Bob to respond and continue the dialogue.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer attempts to strike a balance between securing a decent price and keeping the negotiation open.  Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds, potentially moving closer to his price or considering the option of selling to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 perfectly aligns with my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's no guarantee of success, and I risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Risk of Losing to John:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I'll be left with only John's offer, which is the same price. 

**Conclusion:** 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at my minimum price and guarantees a successful transaction without further negotiation."
