Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I've done my research on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below what the product is worth to both of us. While I have a guaranteed offer from John, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the valuation. However, my assessment of the product's potential value and future returns leads me to believe it's worth significantly more than your offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This price reflects the true worth of this unique opportunity."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, I still believe the product is worth significantly more. Accepting his offer now would leave a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to demonstrate that I'm not willing to settle for a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1100000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I can go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and while it's not ideal, getting $1,050,000 is a good deal. It's better to secure a profit now than risk losing him entirely and only getting $1,000,000 from John."
