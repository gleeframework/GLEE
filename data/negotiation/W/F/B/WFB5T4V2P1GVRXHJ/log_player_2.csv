"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $9,000 is higher than Bob's maximum price of $8,000. Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a price lower than $8,000. While Alice's offer of $8,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher.  Bob should continue negotiating to try to get a better price."
