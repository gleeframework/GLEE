"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to her, so she's already making a profit by selling it to me. I'm not willing to pay $1,300,000, which is more than the product is worth to her. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get a better deal from John.
