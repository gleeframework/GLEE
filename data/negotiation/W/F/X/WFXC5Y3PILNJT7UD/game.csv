"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. Given the value of the product for me is around $800,000, I'm willing to offer $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This reflects the product's inherent worth while still acknowledging your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise given the value of the product for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
