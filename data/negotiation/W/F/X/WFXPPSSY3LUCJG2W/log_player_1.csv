"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,450,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and provides a good chance that Bob will accept.  It also takes into account that Bob values the product at $1,500,000, leaving some room for him to feel like he's getting a good deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offers getting lower, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This is a guaranteed sale and will allow me to avoid further risk of getting an even lower price from Bob.  It's also important to consider the time and energy involved in continuing the negotiations with Bob, which might not be worth the potential gain of a slightly higher price."
