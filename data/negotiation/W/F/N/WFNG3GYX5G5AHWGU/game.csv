"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. Could we try something around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $10,250? I think that's a fair compromise.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"I can see that you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $10,500.  This is my final offer, as I need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $10,500, but I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free upgrade that's worth $1,000. So, effectively, you'll be getting the product for $9,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,9,
