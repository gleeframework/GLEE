{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at 950000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm still confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'll continue negotiating in hopes of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and represents a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below 975000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product considering its value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my budget, and we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation. It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price.  Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation and potentially missing out on the product entirely, I'll purchase the product from John for $800,000. This ensures I acquire the product within my budget."
