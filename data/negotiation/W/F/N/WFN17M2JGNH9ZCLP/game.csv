"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and represents a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below 975000.
