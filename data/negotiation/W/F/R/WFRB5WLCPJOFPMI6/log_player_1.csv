Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell,  $10,500 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line.  Could you do $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're motivated to sell, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $10,000. Can we make a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason: Bob is unwilling to budge past $10,000.  I can get that from John with no further negotiation. It's time to move on and guarantee the sale."
