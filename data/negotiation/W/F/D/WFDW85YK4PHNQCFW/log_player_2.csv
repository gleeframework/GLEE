Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is your final offer, and it's a calculated move to maximize your savings while still keeping the deal alive. Here's why:

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** It's a significant step closer to Alice's last offer, showing you are serious about closing the deal. 
* **Leaving No Room:** It's close enough to Alice's potential minimum that she's unlikely to reject and risk losing the sale. 
* **Leveraging Your Position:** You still have the option to walk away and buy from John if Alice rejects.  This gives you leverage to push for a better price.

This offer puts Alice in a position where accepting means a higher price but securing a sale. Rejecting risks losing the deal altogether. It's a high-pressure situation that could force Alice to accept your offer."
