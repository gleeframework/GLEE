"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $110 is still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, aiming to see how much bargaining room there is.  It's still significantly below my $80 maximum, leaving room for negotiation while trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $60. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $90. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is willing to meet in the middle at $90. This is a reasonable price and below my $100 limit, so it makes sense to accept and avoid potentially losing the deal."
