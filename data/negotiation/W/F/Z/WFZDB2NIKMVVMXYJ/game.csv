"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a good price while I still achieve a significant return on my investment. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $600,000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $900,000 is the lowest I can go. This still represents a substantial value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $750,000? ",750000.0,Bob,4,
