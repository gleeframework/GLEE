Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate (even if it's just a feeling of getting a slightly better deal). 
* **Secure a Sale:** This price is still significantly higher than John's offer of $100, ensuring Alice a good profit even if Bob declines."
