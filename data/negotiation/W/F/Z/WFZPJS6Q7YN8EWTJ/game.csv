,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,250,000?  This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the transaction. Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer $1,175,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not able to go as low as $1,175,000.  How about we split the difference?  $1,212,500 is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?",1212500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,212,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,195,000, which is a fair compromise and leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the agreement. Let me know what you think.",1195000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is the lowest I can go, but it's still a good deal for both of us.  Let's get this done!",1200000.0,Alice,7,
