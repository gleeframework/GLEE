"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,300,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay. There is room for negotiation and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,250,000?  This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the transaction. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,250,000 is closer to Bob's limit, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will come down further, and Bob is still within his budget to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer $1,175,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not able to go as low as $1,175,000.  How about we split the difference?  $1,212,500 is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,212,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,212,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,212,500 is getting closer to Bob's limit, he's still within his budget to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.  The difference between Alice's offer and John's price is small enough that Bob should continue negotiating with Alice to try and save a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,212,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,195,000, which is a fair compromise and leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1195000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is the lowest I can go, but it's still a good deal for both of us.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is the same price as John's offer. There's no benefit to continuing negotiations with Alice since there's no chance of getting a better deal, and this deal is a good value for Bob."
