(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough decision point. Let's analyze:

* **Bob's latest offer:** $1,200,000
* **John's standing offer:** $1,500,000

Bob is getting closer, and we've only got two rounds left to potentially close a deal with him. The risk is that if we push too hard, he might walk away. 

However, the difference between Bob's offer and John's is substantial ($300,000).  We need to weigh the potential of getting more from Bob against the risk of losing him as a buyer.

**Decision:**

Since we're close to John's price and Bob has consistently increased his offers, let's try one more time to see if we can bridge the gap.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your commitment to this deal is evident.  I'm ready to compromise to finalize this today. Let's agree on $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair balance between our positions."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** We're stating this is our final offer to signal we're serious about closing the deal now. 
* **Compromise:**  We're meeting Bob in the middle between his last offer ($1,200,000) and ours ($1,400,000).
* **Urgency:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation, so there's an implicit urgency for Bob to make a decision."
