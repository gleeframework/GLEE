Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at $8,000. Would you consider that price?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can get elsewhere.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
