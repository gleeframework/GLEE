"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $17,000. It's a steal considering its value, and I'm confident it'll be a great investment for you. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at $8,000. Would you consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can get elsewhere. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground here. ",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I can do $9,500. That's a fair offer considering my maximum budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 is still quite far from what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think? ",11000.0,Alice,5,
