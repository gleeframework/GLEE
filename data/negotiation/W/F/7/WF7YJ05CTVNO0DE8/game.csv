"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $175, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really keen on this product, so how about $150? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
