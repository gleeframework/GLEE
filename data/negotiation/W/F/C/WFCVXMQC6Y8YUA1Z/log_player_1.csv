{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my ideal outcome but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:**  I've highlighted the value to Bob to potentially incentivize him to accept a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I've kept the door open for further discussion.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is a strategic balance between maximizing my earnings and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the farm.  I'll be watching Bob's response to see if he's willing to meet me halfway. If not, I'll be ready to either counter or switch to John, my backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment of the product's value to me, I would like to propose a price of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's potential to reach a mutually beneficial agreement closer to my target of $950,000. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing him that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm confident in the product's value. This will hopefully encourage him to come up with a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $900,000. This would allow for a more comfortable profit margin for me.  Let's keep talking - I'm open to a compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I've moved slightly closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating my desired margin:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of my target price point. 
* **Encouraging compromise:**  I'm emphasizing the desire for a mutually agreeable outcome.

**Strategy:**

My counteroffer balances firmness with flexibility.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my ideal while signaling openness to negotiation. I'm hoping this will prompt Bob to come up with a final counteroffer closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. Considering the value of the product to me and your previous offers, I would like to propose a price of $875,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While it's not my ideal outcome, it's a reasonable compromise considering the potential for further negotiation and the possibility of selling to John for a lower price. 

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a deal, avoid further negotiation, and earn a profit that's still significant.  I'm not sure I can get much higher, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale entirely."
