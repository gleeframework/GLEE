{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on something that will truly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000,  trying to get a higher price from Bob is worthwhile.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value. It suggests to Bob that this is a limited-time deal and a significant discount. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting high leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested, potentially resulting in an even higher profit. 
 
**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject this offer. However, the potential for earning an extra $1 from Bob makes it a risk worth taking before accepting John's guaranteed offer."
