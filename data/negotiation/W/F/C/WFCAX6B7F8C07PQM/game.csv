"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for my budget, though. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is unfortunately far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation on both sides. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
