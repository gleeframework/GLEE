"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives us room to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's significantly less than what I value the product at. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate further but I won't settle for anything too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I still want to get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's better than his previous offer, it's still below what I value the product at. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob. There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm not in a rush and am willing to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm making a final concession to Bob.  This price is still a bit higher than what I'd like, but it's close to my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer.  If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will counter with a lower price again, and I might not get a better deal. I also risk running out of rounds and having to sell to John. Therefore, I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
