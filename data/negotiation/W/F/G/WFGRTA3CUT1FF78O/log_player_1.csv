Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price. While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I still believe I can get a better deal with Bob."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I'd like to get closer to my initial target, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and the risk of getting a lower offer from Bob isn't worth it.  It's better to secure a guaranteed $1,000,000 now."
