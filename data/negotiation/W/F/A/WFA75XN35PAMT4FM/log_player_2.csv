Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $160. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, and hopefully, it will be a good starting point for our negotiation."

While $180 is closer to my target price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm sticking with my strategy of small increments. I'm increasing my offer to $175, which is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not budging on her price.  While I'm still hoping for a better deal, I'm worried we're running out of time.  I'm going to buy the product from John for $150. This is the best option for me, as it's within my budget and I'm not willing to risk missing out on the product altogether."
