"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I understand you're willing to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1300000. How about we meet in the middle at $1200000? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to save as much as possible.",1200000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I believe the product's value to you is worth more than that. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",1400000.0,Alice,5,,
