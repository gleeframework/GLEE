Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about $950,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $925,000 is a good deal and it ensures I make a profit while still being within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. It's important to find a middle ground and avoid pushing for an unrealistic price, especially as we are getting closer to the end of the negotiation."
