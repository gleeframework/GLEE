"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to sell you this great product, and I'm willing to start with a price of $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, it's still above my maximum value of $150. There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $137. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $137 is closer to my target price, but I'm still hoping to get it down a bit more. There's still some room for negotiation, so I'll reject her offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $137 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $135. That would give you a good profit, and it's the best I can do right now."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $138, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $138 is within my budget and only slightly higher than my last counteroffer of $135. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a chance she might reject further offers, and I would then be forced to buy from John at $150. Accepting her offer at $138 ensures I get the product for a good price and avoids the risk of a higher price with John."
