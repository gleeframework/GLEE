"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $135? That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"You're getting closer, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $122.50?",122.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $122.50 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $140, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to close this deal if we can find a number that works for both of us. How about $130, and we can wrap this up?",130.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a fair price for the product and we can finally close this deal.",135.0,Alice,7,
