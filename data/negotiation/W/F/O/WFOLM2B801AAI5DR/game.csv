"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $800,000 for the product. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $800,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget.  I'm willing to offer $650,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $725,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $700,000? It's a fair price that's closer to my initial offer, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. I'm proposing a price of $720,000. This is a fair price that's close to your offer, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",720000.0,Alice,5,
