"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to secure a sale, especially if she's motivated to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Bob's ideal price of $12,000. This approach allows for potential compromise while still pushing for a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget. Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate further. There's still room for compromise, and Bob can potentially push Alice closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original counteroffer of $12,500.  If you're not able to go lower, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his counteroffer of $12,500. This demonstrates his commitment to securing a price within his budget. By reiterating his previous offer and highlighting the need to consider other options, Bob puts pressure on Alice to make a decision. He is willing to walk away if the price isn't right, showing Alice that he's not desperate and has alternatives."
