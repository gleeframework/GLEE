"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I want to try to get closer to my desired price.  $1,200,000 is still a good deal for Bob, and I can likely get a better offer by rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $1,225,000. Would that be workable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  While $1,225,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $1,225,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's try a compromise. How about $1,275,000? That gives you a significant savings compared to your initial valuation, and gets me closer to my goal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for sticking with me on this.  I'm willing to go up slightly, but $1,275,000 is still a touch high.  How about we settle at $1,250,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still very close to my goal price of $1,300,000. I think I can get a better offer by making a counteroffer.  We've narrowed the gap significantly, and Bob seems motivated to close the deal."

Round 7

{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your flexibility. $1,250,000 is getting very close.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,262,500? This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the transaction now.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1262500}
