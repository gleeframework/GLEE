"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $1,225,000. Would that be workable?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $1,225,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's try a compromise. How about $1,275,000? That gives you a significant savings compared to your initial valuation, and gets me closer to my goal. Let me know what you think.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for sticking with me on this.  I'm willing to go up slightly, but $1,275,000 is still a touch high.  How about we settle at $1,250,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your flexibility. $1,250,000 is getting very close.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,262,500? This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the transaction now.  What do you say?",1262500.0,Alice,7,
