Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than my minimum value, but still potentially attractive to Bob.  We'll see how he responds and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same amount and going through the hassle of another negotiation."
