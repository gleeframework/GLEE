"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  He has a significant buffer ($3,000) between Alice's offer and what he's willing to pay. By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you taking the time to explain the value of the product. While I'm interested, I'm not quite ready to commit to $12,000. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm happy to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the effort I've put into it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise. Bob is still getting a good deal, saving $3,500 from John's price. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for slightly more savings."
