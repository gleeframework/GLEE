"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. Could we work something out closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my best compromise, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be totally transparent, my absolute top end is $950,000. If you're able to make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're being transparent, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $975,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",975000.0,Alice,5,
