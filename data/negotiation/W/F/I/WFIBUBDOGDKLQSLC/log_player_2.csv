Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're being transparent, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $975,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $975,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and a price well below your maximum budget.
* **""Final Offer"" Pressure:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer, suggesting she might not budge further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at $1,000,000 anyway. Accepting now secures a good deal."
