Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, securing a deal with Bob for a slightly lower price allows us to potentially make a profit more quickly. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,000 creates a sense of urgency (limited-time offer) and potential savings for Bob. This price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed in a positive and collaborative way, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
 
**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always counter-offer with a slightly lower price, moving closer to $8,000. However, she should avoid going below $12,000 as she has a guaranteed buyer in John."
