Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **My Minimum:** I need to get at least $1,000,000 for the product.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.

By offering $1,400,000, I am:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I am trying to capture as much of Bob's extra value as possible.
* **Minimizing Risk:** I am still leaving room for Bob to negotiate, but I am not risking losing the sale to John.

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk, allowing me to potentially earn a higher price while still ensuring I secure a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
