Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
