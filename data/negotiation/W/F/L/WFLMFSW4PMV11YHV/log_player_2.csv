Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get the product for a lower price by making a counteroffer.  There's no reason to accept a price higher than what he could pay to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. Let's meet in the middle at $980,000. This price still represents a significant value for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He has successfully negotiated a price lower than what he would pay John, and it's closer to his desired price point. There's no guarantee he can get it lower in further negotiations."
