"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still having a hard time meeting at that price.  How about $1,000,000?  That's a round number we can both hopefully be happy with.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
