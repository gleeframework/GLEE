"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  This initial offer leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject and try to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,650,000. It's a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway from his last offer, but still giving me a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is now just $50,000 below my minimum.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle for the $1,500,000 from John."
