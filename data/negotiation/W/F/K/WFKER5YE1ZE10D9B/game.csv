"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,150,000? This still allows for some negotiation and could be a good deal for both parties.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  $1,150,000 is significantly below my minimum, and I'm confident the product's worth more than that to you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've considered your latest offer and appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still feel there's room for negotiation. How about we aim for $1,200,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow for a smooth transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
