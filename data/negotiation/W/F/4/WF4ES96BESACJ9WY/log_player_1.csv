Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm initially setting the price at $20,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** While I haven't explicitly stated why the product is worth $20,000, the message implies it has significant value. This could be due to its quality, rarity, or other factors.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""What are your thoughts?""), signaling that I'm willing to discuss the price further. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  Even though the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he doesn't know my minimum price. He might be willing to pay more, especially if he perceives the product as valuable or rare.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk that Bob might reject a $20,000 offer outright. However, since I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, I'm not risking a loss by starting higher."
