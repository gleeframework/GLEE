"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair offer that reflects the value to me and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident we can finalize this deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $885,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment.
