While $900,000 is closer to my limit, I'm still determined to save as much money as possible. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

While I'd prefer to pay less, Alice has come down significantly, and her offer is very close to my limit.  It's worth it to avoid further negotiation and secure the product."
