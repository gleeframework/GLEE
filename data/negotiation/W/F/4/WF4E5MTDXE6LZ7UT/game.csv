"I understand that you're trying to save as much as possible, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $885000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider other options.",885000.0,Alice,5,
