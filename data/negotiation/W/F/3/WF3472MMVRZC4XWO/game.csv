"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This takes into account your needs and ensures a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground that works.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $950,000 is closer, it's still not quite what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I hope you'll agree to it.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
