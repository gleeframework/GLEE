"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $800,000 undervalues the uniqueness and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,250,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
