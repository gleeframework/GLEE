# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a price of $15,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's not a good deal for you. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a better price or explore the alternative option of buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject her offer and counter-offer again.  I might be able to get a lower price, and it's still lower than what I would pay from John."
