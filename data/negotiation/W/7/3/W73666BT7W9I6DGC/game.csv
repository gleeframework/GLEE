"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1500000 to you, so I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential - $1400000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a product that can drive significant growth and value.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1350000? I believe this would still provide a good return on investment for me.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1350000 is still a bit lower than what I believe is fair given the product's true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1375000?  This price allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while also giving you a significant opportunity to acquire a product that can deliver significant returns.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
