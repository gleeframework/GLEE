"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is still below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll counteroffer at $1100000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I need to get closer to my target. Can we meet in the middle at $1025000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll counteroffer at $1075000. This is the lowest I can go without compromising the value of the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
