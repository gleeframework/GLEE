"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, considering it's worth at least $15,000 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially do better. It's worth exploring the negotiation with Alice further before committing to a price that's still above his ideal target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $9,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to drop to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his target.  Bob is in a strong position, knowing he can buy the product from John for $8,000. Continuing the negotiation gives Bob a chance to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $9,750? I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product while still being within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which I believe is a fair price given the product's value. Let's finalize this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $10,000 is getting closer to his ideal, it's still above his target of $8,000.  He has the option to buy from John for less, so it's worth seeing if he can get Alice to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800.  This is a small concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where the negotiation isn't producing results that are beneficial to him. He's already reached his counteroffer limit and Alice isn't budging much further. While $9,800 is closer to his ideal, he has a better alternative: buying the product from John for $8,000. At this point, it's more beneficial to end the negotiation with Alice and secure the product at a lower price from John."
