"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, considering it's worth at least $15,000 to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $9,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to drop to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $9,750? I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product while still being within my budget.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which I believe is a fair price given the product's value. Let's finalize this deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800.  This is a small concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",9800.0,Alice,7,
