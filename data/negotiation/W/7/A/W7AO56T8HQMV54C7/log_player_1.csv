{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, I give him a sense of getting a good deal if he negotiates down.
* **Open Communication:** I encourage open communication by asking for his thoughts on the offer, allowing for a more collaborative negotiation.
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. This gives me leverage during negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth pursuing further. 
* **Be Prepared to Counter:**  I'll be ready with a counteroffer based on Bob's counter, and I'll keep my backup option (John) in mind as a benchmark for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for me. 
* **Leveraging John:**  I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, making Bob's offer less appealing. 
* **Continuing Negotiations:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price. There's still a possibility of getting closer to my desired value.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob.  My counteroffer will be higher than $850,000 but lower than my original offer of $950,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also emphasizes my product's value.
* **Monitor John:**  I'll continue to monitor John's interest and be ready to accept his offer if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer of $950,000.
* **Still Above My Minimum:**  $900,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using language like ""find common ground"" to signal that I'm open to further discussions.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  I'll wait to see if Bob accepts this offer. If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I want to continue negotiating or accept John's offer. 
* **Be Ready to Adjust:**  I'll be prepared to make further adjustments to the price based on Bob's response and my assessment of his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise and demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring your product.  Let's try to reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum, but Not Enough:**  Bob's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it's still a significant difference. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of getting stuck in a prolonged process with no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome.  He's shown a reluctance to significantly increase his offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is more than what I'd get with Bob at this point.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept John's Offer:** I will contact John and accept his offer to sell the product for $1,000,000. This ensures a quick and profitable sale, eliminating the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
