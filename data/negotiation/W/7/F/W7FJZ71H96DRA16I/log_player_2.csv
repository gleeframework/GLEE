"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident it will be a great fit for you. I'm willing to start with a price of $1400000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is better than John's, Bob still has room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $1250000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price. Bob can continue negotiating to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000. However, that's still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $1320000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been diligently negotiating with Alice, trying to lower the price. While $1,320,000 is still above Bob's initial goal of $1,200,000, it's only $120,000 more.  Considering the risk of further negotiation and the possibility that Alice could raise the price again, accepting this offer is the best choice at this point.  

Bob can always choose to buy from John in a later round if negotiations with Alice fall apart, but accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
