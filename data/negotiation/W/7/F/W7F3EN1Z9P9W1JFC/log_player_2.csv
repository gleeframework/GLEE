"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This is my top offer, as I'm sure you understand."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target of $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but unfortunately, that's still a bit higher than I'm able to go.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my initial offer of $1,000,000.  It's my maximum budget, and I truly believe this product is worth it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're committed to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a middle ground. I'll offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is only $50,000 away from Bob's maximum budget. However, Bob is still committed to saving as much as possible. At this point, there is a high risk that further negotiation will result in Alice not budging from her price, leaving Bob with no choice but to accept $1,050,000.

Since John is willing to sell the product for Bob's target price of $1,000,000, it's the most rational decision to buy from John. It saves Bob $50,000 and guarantees he gets the product within his budget."
