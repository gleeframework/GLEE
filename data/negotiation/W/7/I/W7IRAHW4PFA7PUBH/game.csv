"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering your product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1000000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $1000000. Considering your value for the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a reasonable profit.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm prepared to go.  I'm willing to offer $1050000. This reflects a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1080000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
