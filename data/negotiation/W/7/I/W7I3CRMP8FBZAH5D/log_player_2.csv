"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, you can potentially get it for even less. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and try to lower the price further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110?  That's still a great deal for you, considering how much you value it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get it even lower by making another counteroffer.  It's still a better deal than buying from John."
