"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the purchase.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking $1,250,000 is a sweet spot. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not ready to give up yet, Bob. I think we can do better than $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,250,000. Let's try $1,225,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
