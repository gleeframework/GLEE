"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering its worth to both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is asking for $8,500, which is more than you're willing to pay. 
* You know John will sell you the same product for $8,000. 

It makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save money."
