Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I am willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount."

Bob is meeting me above my minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate carries the risk of him lowering his offer. It's time to close the deal."
