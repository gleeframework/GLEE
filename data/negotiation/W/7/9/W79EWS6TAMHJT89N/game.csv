"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $750,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",880000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $820,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I see in the product.",820000.0,Bob,4,
