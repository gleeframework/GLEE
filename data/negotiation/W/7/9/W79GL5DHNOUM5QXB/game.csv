"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $700,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this work. This is a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits. Let's work together to find a solution.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you be open to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet, but $750,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will benefit both of us.  Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,6,
