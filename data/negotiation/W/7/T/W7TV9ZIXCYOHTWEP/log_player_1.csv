"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $150 to me, and I want to maximize my profit.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $160 is better than selling to John, I'm not satisfied with that price. It's too close to my minimum value, and I believe I can get a better offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm going to counter with $180.  This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still pushing for a price closer to my initial goal.  I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would like to get closer to my initial goal, I've already had a couple of rounds of negotiation and Bob is only willing to go up to $170.  Accepting his offer at $170 is the best option right now. It's more than John's offer and keeps the negotiation process moving forward."
