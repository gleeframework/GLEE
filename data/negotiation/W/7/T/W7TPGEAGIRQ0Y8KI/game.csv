"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000.  Would you consider $1,025,000?  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your hesitation, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
