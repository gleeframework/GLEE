"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Alice,5,
