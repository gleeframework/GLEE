Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see that you're willing to pay a bit more than $10,000, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?

At this point, Alice has come down slightly, and while it's not the ideal price, it's the best we're likely to get. Continuing to negotiate might irritate Alice or lead to her sticking firmly to this price. It's better to secure the deal at $11,000 rather than risk having to buy from John at $12,000."
