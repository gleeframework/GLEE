"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,200?",10200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,200 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $10,500?  That would work much better for me.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see that you're willing to pay a bit more than $10,000, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
