"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $100, and Alice is offering it for $95. While this is a good deal, you can get it from John for $100. It's better to reject Alice's offer and get the product from John, as you save $5 compared to buying from Alice."
