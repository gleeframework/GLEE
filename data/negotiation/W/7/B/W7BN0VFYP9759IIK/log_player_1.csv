Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I agree this product has great potential, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This would still represent a significant profit for you, and it's within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
