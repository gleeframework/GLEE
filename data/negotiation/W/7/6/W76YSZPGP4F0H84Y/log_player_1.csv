Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still a ""deal"" compared to what John is willing to pay. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers adds pressure for Bob to act quickly and not risk missing out.

**Why not other prices?**

* **Lower prices (e.g., $9,000 - $10,000):**  While more likely to be accepted by Bob, Alice leaves potential profit on the table.
* **Higher prices (e.g., $11,500 or more):**  The risk of Bob rejecting the offer increases significantly. It's unlikely he'd pay more than $10,000 considering his valuation."
