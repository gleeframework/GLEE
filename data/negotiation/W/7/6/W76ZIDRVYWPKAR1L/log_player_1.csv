"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting at $1,000,000 allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefits for both of us, hoping to foster a collaborative tone. 
* **Room for Compromise:** This offer leaves space for Bob to counter without me feeling like I've lost too much ground.
* **John as Safety Net:** I'm aware that I can always go to John for $1,200,000, so I don't have to be overly aggressive in the initial round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I am interested in purchasing it, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Difference:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Space:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, I'm not yet ready to give up on potentially securing a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would still represent a significant gain for you, and it's a price I can reasonably accept."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $950,000 is still above Bob's initial offer but below my minimum threshold, leaving space for further negotiation.

* **Staying Above Minimum:** I'm maintaining a price that's above my minimum threshold, ensuring I'm not sacrificing too much in the early rounds."

* **Negotiation Progress:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $925,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference again and go with $937,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 937500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Close the Gap:** I'm making another incremental move towards Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.

* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly reinforcing the rationale behind my price point.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and collaborative tone, hoping to maintain a positive negotiation environment.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer, while closer, is still below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000.
* **Closing the Gap:** We are getting closer to a potential deal, but I still have several rounds left to potentially secure a higher price.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $930,000 is getting very close to what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $935,000? I'm confident we can make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 935000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Incremental Move:**  I'm only increasing the price by $5,000, showing that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Framing:** This reinforces the idea of a compromise and makes the offer feel more fair.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation friendly.
* **Maintaining Value:**  This offer is still above my minimum threshold but getting close to a point where I might consider accepting if Bob doesn't counter further.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a safety net, I'm still hoping to close a deal with Bob if possible."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000, even though we've been negotiating for several rounds.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We only have two rounds left before I have to decide whether to sell to John.
* **John's Offer:** While I'm not thrilled about selling to John at $1,200,000, it's becoming a more attractive option as I'm not making significant progress with Bob. 
* **Potential Counteroffer:** There's still a chance that Bob will increase his offer in the next round, but I'm not willing to risk settling for a price significantly below my minimum."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been negotiating for a while now, and I appreciate your persistence.  While $927,500 is closer to what I need, it's still a bit below my minimum.  To be honest, I'm starting to consider my other options.  How about we meet in the middle one last time at $932,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  If we can't agree, I'll have to seriously consider my other offers."", ""product_price"": 932500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We only have one round left after this one, so I need to make a strong final push.
* **""Other Options""  Threat:** I'm subtly reminding Bob about my other offers (John's) to create a sense of urgency.
* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise while maintaining a firm stance.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the need to reach an agreement in this round, making it clear that the deal could fall through otherwise.
* **Balance:** I'm balancing the need to get as close to my minimum price as possible with the reality that I have to close the deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts, Alice. After careful consideration, I believe $930,000 represents a fair price for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiations.  I have to make a decision.
* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $930,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I might be able to push Bob a little further, there's a risk that he won't budge.  It's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.  

By selling to John, I ensure that I achieve my minimum desired price and close the deal with certainty."
