"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I am interested in purchasing it, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would still represent a significant gain for you, and it's a price I can reasonably accept.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I believe we can find a middle ground. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $925,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference again and go with $937,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",937500.0,Alice,5,

"I see your reasoning, Alice. I'll consider it carefully. Given the situation, how about $930,000?",930000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $930,000 is getting very close to what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $935,000? I'm confident we can make this work for both of us.",935000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been negotiating for a while now, and I appreciate your persistence.  While $927,500 is closer to what I need, it's still a bit below my minimum.  To be honest, I'm starting to consider my other options.  How about we meet in the middle one last time at $932,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  If we can't agree, I'll have to seriously consider my other offers.",932500.0,Alice,9,
