"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $12,000 from John. Since Alice's offer is $11,000, it's worth trying to negotiate further. There's potential to save some money by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's new offer of $11,200 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's preferred price point.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,200 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,800. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,200 and $10,800.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $11,000.** This is the same as her initial offer, which Bob rejected before. 
* **Bob's maximum price is $12,000.** He can buy from John for that price.
* **Continuing to negotiate is risky.** There's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further, and Bob could end up paying more by rejecting this offer and potentially having to buy from John.

It's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer. He's getting the product for a lower price than he'd pay from John, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will be successful."
