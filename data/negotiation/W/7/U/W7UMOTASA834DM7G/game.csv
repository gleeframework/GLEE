"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  I'm still interested in the product, but $11,200 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay at the moment.  How about we settle at $10,800?  That's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,200 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,800. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,200 and $10,800. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
