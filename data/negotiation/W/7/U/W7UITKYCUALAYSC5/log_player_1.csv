{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving him a potential benefit, but it's also lower than my minimum of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to keep in mind that I have a backup buyer in John, so I can always walk away and get my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only able to pay up to $9,000 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I'm still not able to meet at $10,500. Can we discuss a price closer to $9,000? That would allow me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for improvement. It's important to remember that I have John as a backup buyer willing to pay my minimum price. I'll counteroffer again and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  It's a price that allows me to cover my costs and allows you to get the product at a reasonable price. Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This allows me to stay within my budget while still providing a fair return for you. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  Even though Bob came up to $9,500, that's still a significant amount lower than my minimum price, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on the full $15,000. John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my full price, so it's the best decision for me at this point."
