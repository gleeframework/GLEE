"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a great deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. To find common ground, I propose a price of $1,100,000. This allows for a reasonable profit while still offering you a substantial savings compared to the original asking price. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial transaction.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
