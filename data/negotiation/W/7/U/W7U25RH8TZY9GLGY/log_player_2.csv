"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is within his budget, he can potentially get the product for less by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, buying the product from John for $100 is the most economical choice."
