Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and positive, highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob.  

**Strategy:** 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that benefits me, but also leaves room for Bob to counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation open and allows for potential compromise.  If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to counter his offer or  move on to John if the price isn't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you be able to consider $9,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target. I'll try to meet Bob halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** This offer is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows flexibility while still ensuring a profit above my minimum.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns and reiterate the value of the product, framing the offer as a win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while showing a willingness to compromise. If Bob accepts, I achieve a decent profit. If he rejects, I can either counter again or move on to John, depending on how far apart our positions are."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $9,500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling for $9,500.  I'm holding out for a better offer.  I can potentially get closer to my target price with another counteroffer. 

**Strategy:** 

I'll continue to counteroffer to see if I can push the price up further. If Bob rejects again, I'll assess how close we are to my minimum and decide whether to sell to John or make one final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which I think is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this number. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've dropped my price slightly again, showing flexibility and a willingness to find common ground. $10,000 is still a decent profit for me while potentially being acceptable for Bob.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the compromise I've made. I'm inviting Bob to reach an agreement, which can encourage him to accept the offer.

**Strategy:** 

This counteroffer is a last attempt to close the gap with Bob. If he rejects it, I'll have to decide between accepting his previous offer ($9,500) or selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your patience, Alice. I understand the value of the product and your position. I would like to propose $9,750 as a fair price for the product, considering my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,750 is getting close to my minimum price of $15,000, it's still not enough for me to feel comfortable selling.  The negotiations have gone back and forth, and I believe that there's a limit to how much I can push Bob.  John is offering me a significantly better price, and it's time to take the sure thing.

**Strategy:**

Instead of continuing to haggle with Bob, I'm opting for the guaranteed $15,000 from John. This ensures I get the maximum value for my product and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially resulting in a lower price."
