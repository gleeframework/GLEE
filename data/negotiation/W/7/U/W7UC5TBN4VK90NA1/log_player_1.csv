"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that, once you see everything it offers, you'll agree it's a worthwhile investment."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price to allow room for negotiation. This strategy also helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" we're providing a reason for the high initial price, even though we know Bob values it lower.
* **Leaving Room:** The significant gap between our asking price and John's offer gives us ample space to negotiate over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is above his perceived value, indicating room for negotiation. 
* Accepting $1,400,000 would mean leaving a significant amount of money on the table compared to John's offer. 
* We are still in the early rounds, and a counteroffer allows us to steer the negotiation closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  It seems we both see the inherent value in this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are lowering our asking price, but not drastically. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming high. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  We are continuing to emphasize the product's ""potential"" to justify a price above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Guiding Negotiation:** By making a smaller concession, we signal that we're looking for a price closer to our initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Offer:**  $1,600,000 is a significant amount above Bob's initial offer and a reasonable profit margin for you.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching a stalemate. Accepting now secures a good deal. 
* **Time Value:** While we have rounds remaining, closing the deal sooner rather than later has its own advantages."
