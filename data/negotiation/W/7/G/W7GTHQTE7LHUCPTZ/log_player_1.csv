Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I still believe that $10,000 is a fair price. I would like to stick to my original offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob seems firm on his $10,000 offer. While I could push for more, there's a risk he won't budge and I'd lose out on the opportunity to make $2,000 more than John's offer."
