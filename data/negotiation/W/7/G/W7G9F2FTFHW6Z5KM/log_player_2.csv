Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to reach $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll see the value in this product, and it's worth the extra investment. How about we settle on $975,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to your target price, and it's worth accepting this offer. You're only $75,000 over your ideal price, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely. It's a good compromise."
