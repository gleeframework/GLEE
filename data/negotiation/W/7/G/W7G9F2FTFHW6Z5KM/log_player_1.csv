Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $900,000 at this point.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to reach $1,000,000.
