Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise. It's higher than John's offer, giving me a better return than my minimum. But it's also lower than the product's worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to accept.  This maximizes my chances of getting a better price while still having a backup option if Bob rejects."
