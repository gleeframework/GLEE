Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need at least $8,500 to make this work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $8500 is a bit steep. Can you meet me at $8000? That's the price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. He's offered my minimum price, which is what I'm willing to take for the product.  It's a fair price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
