"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me. This gives Bob room to negotiate but also ensures I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I consider the product to be worth. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but still aiming for a price closer to what I believe the product is worth. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while also leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can push for a better deal. I'm confident I can secure a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm coming down a bit more, but I'm still aiming for a profit that feels reasonable. With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is starting to mount, but I'm hoping this small compromise will be enough to sway Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

It's getting risky, but I still believe I can get a better deal than $10,000. It's likely Bob is willing to go a bit higher, and I have time for one more counteroffer before the clock starts ticking down too fast."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250} 
```

This is my final push to get a better deal with Bob. I'm only slightly lowering my price from the previous round, demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement while still maintaining a decent profit margin. With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to make a decision.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 2 rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is too high.  John offers a guaranteed price of $15,000, which is much more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's time to secure the sale with John."
