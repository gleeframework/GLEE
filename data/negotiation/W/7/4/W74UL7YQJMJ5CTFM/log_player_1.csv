{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $120.  I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are not moving in a direction that gets me closer to my minimum price. It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $120 from John. I'm going to sell the product to John."
