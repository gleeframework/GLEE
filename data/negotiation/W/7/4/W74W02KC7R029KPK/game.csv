"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $7,500 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to go down to $10,000 for a quick sale. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
