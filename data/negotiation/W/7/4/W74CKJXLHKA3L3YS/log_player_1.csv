Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $100 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Avoiding a Too High Price:**  Starting too high (close to $120) might discourage Bob without room for him to negotiate. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob."
