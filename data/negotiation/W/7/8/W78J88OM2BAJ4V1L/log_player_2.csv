"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a fantastic opportunity for you, Bob! I'm willing to sell this amazing product to you for $9,500. It's a steal at this price, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further.  Even if she doesn't, you haven't lost anything and can still buy from John."
