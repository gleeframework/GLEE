Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. I believe it's a fair price considering its quality and potential benefits."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much as possible from the sale. Offering it for $125 to Bob first allows for a potential $45 profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $125 is the initial offer, there might be room for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a price potentially higher than $80 (his perceived value).
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 guarantees that Alice won't be stuck with the product if Bob rejects the offer. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or willingness to pay more than his perceived value."
