"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
