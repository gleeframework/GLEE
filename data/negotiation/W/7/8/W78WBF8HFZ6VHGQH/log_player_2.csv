"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction. Offering $950,000 is a bold move, but it's within the range of what Bob is willing to pay, and leaves room for negotiation.  The goal is to push Alice closer to her desired price while still getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but Bob can still do better. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a lower price. It's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for more bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway.  $1,000,000 is a fair price for both parties - it's Alice's minimum and within Bob's budget. This is a strong offer that shows Bob's seriousness in buying the product without going over his limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,025,000, which is very close to Bob's desired price of $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate, and Bob is already saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal for both parties, so accepting the offer ensures a successful transaction."
