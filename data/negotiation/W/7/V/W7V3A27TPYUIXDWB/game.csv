"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I see its potential, I'm looking to invest at a lower price point. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,100,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob, but I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,025,000 for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for that price, but I'm not going any lower than that.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
