"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is your maximum budget, there's no information yet about the value of the product to Alice.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $8,000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
