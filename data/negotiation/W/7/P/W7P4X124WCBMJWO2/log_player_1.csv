{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think! "", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing that it's ""of great interest"" to him.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest while setting a strong initial bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss.  

Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:**  I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point.
* **Gain information:**  Bob's counteroffer provides valuable insight into his budget and willingness to negotiate.

Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed option, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's budget:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraint to show empathy and maintain a positive tone.
* **Compromise:** I propose a compromise price of $12,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Open-ended invitation:** I end with an open-ended invitation to find a compromise, further encouraging negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while maintaining a positive and collaborative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $10000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price.  I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and secure a better deal. 

Here's why I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer:

* **Potential for higher price:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price range.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation.
* **Not a significant loss:** While $10,000 is not ideal, it's not a significant loss compared to selling to John for $15,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can continue exploring the possibility of reaching a more favorable price point for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I understand that $10,000 is your current limit. Let's split the difference one more time.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge progress:** I acknowledge Bob's compromise to maintain a positive tone and build rapport.
* **Final offer:** I'm proposing a ""final"" offer, implying that I'm nearing my limit. 
* **Split the difference:** I'm suggesting to split the difference between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000), making it seem like a fair compromise.
* **Closing statement:** I'm ending with a question that encourages Bob to accept the offer and finalize the deal.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between my desired price and Bob's budget while suggesting that it's a fair and final offer."
