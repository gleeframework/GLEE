Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a high bar for the negotiation and allows for potential room to compromise. I'll need to see Bob's reaction and adapt my strategy based on his counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum, and I only have two rounds left. It's a risk to keep negotiating and potentially end up with nothing. I'm confident I can find a way to make up for the difference in price through other means."
