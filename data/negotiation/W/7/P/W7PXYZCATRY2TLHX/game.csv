"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I believe it's a bit pricey at $9000, and I'd like to discuss a more competitive price. Let me know what you think!",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8500?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8500. I'm willing to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7800. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the market value of the product. Let me know what you think!",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7800 is still a bit below what I need to make a fair profit.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8200?  This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think!",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further. However, I'm still not comfortable going up to $8200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7800 and $8200, which would be $7950. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. Let me know what you think!",7950.0,Bob,6,
