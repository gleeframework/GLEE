"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $120. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above my budget of $120, but it's getting closer. I'll reject the offer again and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round.  Since John is selling the product for $120, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Alice before resorting to buying from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but I'm not willing to go any lower. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still above my budget of $120.  I'm going to reject it and try to see if I can get a better deal with Alice in the next round.  I'm still holding out hope that I can get it for my target price or close to it, but John is a viable backup option if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work.  $125 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $122.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 122}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to make this work, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for anything less than $130. It's a unique item, and I think it's worth it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $122 and $130, so I'll offer it to you for $126. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $126
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $126 is still above my maximum budget of $120. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, with only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to get the price down further.  Since John is selling the product for my target price of $120, it's the most sensible option to buy from him now and avoid the risk of not getting a deal at all."
