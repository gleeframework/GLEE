"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled about Bob's low offer, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $5 less than my counteroffer, and it's more than my minimum value.  I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and secure the sale."
