"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,125,000 is more in line with my budget. Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This price reflects its worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  However, $1,800,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,350,000?  That would be a fair compromise, I believe.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer to where I'd be willing to go, it's still a significant discount. My final offer is $1,600,000.  This offer represents the absolute lowest price I can accept considering its value. Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  While $1,600,000 is a tempting price, I can't quite justify it in my budget. My absolute final offer is $1,450,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. ",1450000.0,Bob,6,
