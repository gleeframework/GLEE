{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is a better offer than Alice's previous one, Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. He should reject the offer and continue negotiating, as he has more room to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'll offer $11,000 for the product.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows him to keep pushing for a lower price.  Alice has already made several concessions, so Bob is confident he can get her down further.  Also, he's aware that he can always walk away and buy from John, giving him a safety net in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close!  I'm going to offer $11,250 for the product.  This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now pushing for a price that's very close to his maximum limit, and it's clear that he's serious about reaching an agreement. By declaring this as his final offer, he puts the pressure on Alice to accept. He's also highlighting the progress they've made and demonstrating a willingness to compromise, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand this is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $12200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,200 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While the negotiation has been close, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down further. In this situation, it's best for Bob to walk away and buy the product from John for $10,000.  He can save $2,200 by doing so.  This decision prioritizes saving money over trying to push for a slightly better deal with Alice."
