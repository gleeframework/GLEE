"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price, $15,000, because I don't know Bob's valuation. This allows for room to negotiate downward if necessary. I'm aiming to maximize my profits, and I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it immediately. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. There are 8 rounds left, and I have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price from $15,000 to $12,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This is still a significant profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's initial counteroffer of $10,000. I want to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway."
