"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $8750.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $8500, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $8600, but that's as low as I can go.",8600.0,Alice,5,
