"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $10,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $8750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price. While Alice's new offer of $8,750 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for further negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to bring the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $8500, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $8600, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Alice is offering $8,600, which is only $600 less than her initial price. While this is a decent discount, Bob has a guaranteed option of buying the product from John for $8,000.  Further negotiation with Alice might yield a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and it risks prolonging the process.  Choosing to buy from John ensures a secure and known price, saving Bob the hassle and potential loss of time."
