"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. However, I'm open to discussing what would make this a worthwhile investment for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I value finding common ground, the product's worth to me is considerably higher.  I could consider $1,450,000.  This reflects its true potential and leaves a margin for a mutually beneficial deal.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you value the product highly, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
