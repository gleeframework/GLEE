"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, a bit higher than Bob's perceived value.  I want to see if I can get him to budge a little, knowing I can always fall back on John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer of $105. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter with $115. This is still higher than Bob's initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this is enough to entice him, but I'm ready to potentially lower the price further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $107 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $110. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still hopeful that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me in the middle. I'm aware that I'm nearing the midpoint of our negotiations, and I want to avoid reaching the point where I'm forced to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $108. While it's not my ideal price, it's still better than selling to John for $100, and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. I'm hoping this is a good compromise that will close the deal."
