Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal for something you'll benefit from greatly."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By initially offering the product at a price higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum, you leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value"" aims to frame the price as justified and potentially sway Bob's perception of its worth. 
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning listing the product ""publicly"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to act quickly.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have the security of John's offer, ensuring you'll get at least $8,000 for the product."
