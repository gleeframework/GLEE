"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm confident this product will bring you significant value at $1,200,000.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high.  It's closer to what Bob is willing to pay, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob another chance to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to sell at a good price, and I want to buy this product.  However, $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,075,000. This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
