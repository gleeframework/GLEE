"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm confident this product will bring you significant value at $1,200,000.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your desire to sell at a good price, and I want to buy this product.  However, $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,075,000. This is a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
