"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Establishing value:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to discussion:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially counteroffer.

**Note:** This is just my initial strategy. I will need to adjust based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get more.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is interested in the product and has shown willingness to negotiate. 
* **Rounds remaining:** I still have 9 rounds left, so I have time to try to improve the offer.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer. This will show flexibility while trying to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $18,000 to $14,000. This demonstrates flexibility and signals my interest in reaching an agreement.
* **Value Justification:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price. This helps to reinforce the idea that $14,000 is still a good deal.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:**  By proposing $14,000, I leave room for further negotiation if Bob is still not satisfied. 
* **Positive Language:** The message uses positive language like ""fair price"" and ""satisfied"" to create a more collaborative atmosphere.

**Next Step:**  I will carefully evaluate Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If Bob rejects, I will continue to negotiate with him or consider selling to John depending on the remaining rounds and the potential for a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14000, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13500? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $13,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I still believe there's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to my desired price.  I want to see if I can push him a bit further.
* **Rounds remaining:** I have 6 rounds left, which gives me time to explore further negotiation before resorting to selling to John.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to close the gap while still securing a better deal than my minimum. I'll need to be careful, though, as further rejections could lead me to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your offer of $13,500. I'm willing to go down to $13,750. This is a compromise that keeps us both in a good position. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but meaningful counter:**  I'm proposing a counteroffer just $250 higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a slightly better deal.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize that this is a ""compromise"" and keeps ""both of us in a good position.""  This helps maintain a collaborative tone.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I still have 5 rounds remaining, and I'm not desperate to sell right now. This allows me to hold out for a slightly better offer.

**Next Steps:**  I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to weigh the remaining rounds against the possibility of selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, and $13750 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $13200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob's offer of $13,200 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. However, I still have 4 rounds left, and I believe there's a chance I can get a better deal.
* **Testing the limits:** I want to see if I can push Bob just a little further to see if he's willing to go higher.
* **Potential for better deal:** Even if Bob rejects, I'm still in a good position with 4 rounds left and the option to sell to John for $12,000.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to close the gap while still maximizing my potential earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're very close.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $13,400. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 13400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price exactly halfway between Bob's offer of $13,200 and my previous offer of $13,750. This demonstrates a willingness to meet in the middle and shows I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Positive language:** I use positive phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""reach an agreement"" to maintain a collaborative tone.
* **Closing the gap:** This offer is only $200 away from my minimum acceptable price, but it's still $200 higher than Bob's offer. This gives me a small cushion and shows that I'm not willing to accept his last offer without some compromise.

**Next Steps:** I'll analyze Bob's response carefully. If he rejects, I'll need to weigh the remaining rounds against the possibility of selling to John. If he accepts, I'll have successfully negotiated a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13400 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13100? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,100 is only $100 away from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This is a very good deal, and I could be tempted to accept it.
* **Limited time:** However, I only have two rounds remaining. There's a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer in the next round, and then I will be forced to sell to John for $12,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a good deal, but I'm unsure if I can push him any higher. Selling to John is a safe option that ensures I get my minimum price, but I would be missing out on $1,100.

**Conclusion:** I'm choosing to **sell to John for $12,000**. While this is less than what I could potentially get from Bob, the risk of further negotiation is too high with only two rounds remaining. It's better to secure the guaranteed price and avoid the possibility of ending up with a lower offer."
