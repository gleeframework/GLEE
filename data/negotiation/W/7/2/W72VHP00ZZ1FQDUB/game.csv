"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $9000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to come down to $7500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7500. How about we meet in the middle at $8250? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8250 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $8000.  This feels like a fair midpoint, and I'm very serious about buying the product.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $8000. How about we try $8300? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",8300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I really appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $8300 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to walk away, but I'm hoping we can find a compromise.  How about $8100?  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",8100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8100 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower. How about we meet in the middle at $8150? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",8150.0,Alice,7,
