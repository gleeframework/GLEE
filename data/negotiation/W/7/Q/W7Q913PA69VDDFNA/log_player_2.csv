"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique features and benefits, I believe a price of $15,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is way over his budget and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice first to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is closer to the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He can get the product for a much lower price from John, so it makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice further."
