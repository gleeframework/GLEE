"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations.  I'm starting with a price of $900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This seems like a fair compromise, and it still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000, so I'm offering $800,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
