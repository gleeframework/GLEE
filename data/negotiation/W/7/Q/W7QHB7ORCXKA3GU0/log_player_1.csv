"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to start with my absolute minimum price.  While Bob only values the product at $10,000, I'm hoping to push for a higher price and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll have to consider whether to lower my price or sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have 8 rounds left before I have to make a decision to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $11,500. This is still above my minimum, but it shows a willingness to compromise. Hopefully, Bob sees this as a fair price and accepts."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering below my minimum, so I'm going to reject his offer again. I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my desired price. It's a risk, but I have 6 rounds left before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $11,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum.  If he rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is inching closer to my desired price, but he's still not at my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer again and hope that he'll budge in the next round. I only have 4 rounds left before I have to make a decision on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $11,000.  I'm starting to run out of time, but I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum just yet. I'm hoping Bob realizes that he might not get a better deal and decides to accept.  If he rejects, I'll have to seriously reconsider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I only have two rounds left, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum. It's getting too risky to continue negotiating with him.  I'm better off taking the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
