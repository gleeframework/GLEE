"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
