Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000.  You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so it makes sense to take the guaranteed deal."
