"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm aware of the potential to sell to John for $10,000, I'm hoping to secure a higher price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm also trying to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 simply doesn't reflect its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This is a fair price for both of us, and ensures we both get what we need out of this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I still feel that $10,000 would be a fair price for the product, considering my budget constraints. Could we possibly meet somewhere between $10,000 and $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is closer to my desired price than $10,000, I'm still not completely satisfied. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, and I'm trying to be fair. But $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,625? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10625}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. Considering my budget, I believe $10,500 would be the most reasonable price for the product. Could we agree on this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price, we're at the point where Bob seems unwilling to budge.  John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which is close to what I'm willing to accept, and it saves me from continuing the negotiation."
