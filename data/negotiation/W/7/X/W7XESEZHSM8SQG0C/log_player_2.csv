"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is starting high. There's plenty of room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay well below Alice's value ($80) to maximize our savings.  Starting significantly lower gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Direct:** We want to maintain a positive tone while clearly stating our price target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I can offer you a compromise at $85. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Alice came down from her initial offer, showing she's willing to negotiate. We're getting closer to her value, but let's see if we can get the price lower. 
* **Not Desperate:** We have several rounds left and the option of John's offer, so we can afford to be a bit more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** We're signaling flexibility by moving closer to Alice's offer while still aiming for a price below her value.
* **Middle Ground:** Proposing a price near the midpoint between our previous offer and hers can encourage agreement.
* **Maintaining Respect:** We're keeping the tone positive and showing Alice we're actively trying to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're still interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $82.50. It's a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Alice is moving closer to our target, the concessions are getting smaller.  We need to signal that we're serious about a lower price. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're over halfway through the rounds, and getting close to the point where John's offer becomes more appealing. 
* **Calculated Risk:** Rejecting this offer carries some risk that Alice might not budge much further, but it's a risk worth taking to potentially save a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm ready to make a deal today, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $79?  That's a very fair price, and it would let us wrap things up right now."",
""product_price"": 79
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sense of Urgency:** We're letting Alice know we're serious about buying *now* if the price is right.
* **Small Concession:**  Moving only $1 from our last offer signals we're nearing our limit, but still open to a deal.
* **Just Below Value:** This offer is just below Alice's value ($80), making it potentially very attractive to her. It's a strong negotiating position with only a few rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $81. It's a price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down considerably and is now only $1 above her value. 
* **Time Running Out:**  We only have a few rounds left, and it's becoming riskier to push for a lower price. Alice might dig in her heels.
* **Good Savings:**  We've managed to get the price down $19 from the initial offer, saving us a significant amount. It's unlikely we'll get much lower than this. 

This offer represents a good balance between saving money and the risk of missing out on the deal altogether."
