"I can see you're still interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $82.50. It's a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm ready to make a deal today, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $79?  That's a very fair price, and it would let us wrap things up right now.",79.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $81. It's a price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a good deal for you.",81.0,Alice,7,
