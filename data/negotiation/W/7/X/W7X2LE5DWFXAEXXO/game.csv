"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a rare opportunity to acquire this product.  Its value is undeniable, and I believe it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, as that's its fair market value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the valuation. However, the value of this product extends beyond its perceived market worth. It holds unique advantages that justify a premium. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,300,000 is still outside my comfortable price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This is a significant step up from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value fairly.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you've made a compelling case, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. Let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing $1,225,000. This reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer.  While I value this product, $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,162,500. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1162500.0,Bob,6,
