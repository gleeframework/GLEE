Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that.

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This still gives you a good deal and is closer to what I need. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original target price, Bob's offer is getting closer. Accepting his offer at $13,000 is a good compromise and secures a sale quickly."
