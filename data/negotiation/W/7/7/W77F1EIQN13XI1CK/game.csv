"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $12000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
