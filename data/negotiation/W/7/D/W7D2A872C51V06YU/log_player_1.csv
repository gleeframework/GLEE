"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, considering my minimum value is $150. This allows room for negotiation and gives me some bargaining power.  I'm also phrasing the message in a friendly and open manner to encourage Bob to engage in a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I will counter with a price slightly higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit to $175, but I can't go any lower than that.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $175 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise, and it's higher than what I'd get from John. It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further rounds of negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether."
