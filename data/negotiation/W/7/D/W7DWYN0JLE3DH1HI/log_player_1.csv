Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offered price is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($80), but it's not ridiculously high. This could pique his interest while still leaving you a good profit margin if he accepts.
* **Below John's Offer:** The offered price is still comfortably below John's guaranteed purchase price ($150), ensuring you're maximizing your potential profit.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between:

1. **Securing a Deal with Bob:** The price is enticing enough that Bob might accept, even if it's slightly above his perceived value.
2. **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** If Bob counter-offers, there's space to negotiate down towards his value while staying above your minimum.
3. **Guaranteeing a Profit:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a backup buyer at a higher price."
