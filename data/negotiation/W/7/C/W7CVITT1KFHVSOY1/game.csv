"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I want to start with a price that reflects the product's true value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, but I need to stay within that budget. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $900,000. It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product yourself. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck in a loop. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can sell it to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $950,000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can reach an agreement at $925,000.  This would allow us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I can meet you halfway between $925,000 and $950,000, which would be $937,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",937500.0,Alice,7,
