Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck in a loop. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can sell it to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.
