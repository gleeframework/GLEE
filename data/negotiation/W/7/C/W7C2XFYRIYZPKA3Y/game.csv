"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $25000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Can you meet me at that price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $18000.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for some negotiation room. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has some value, but $18000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still quite a bit lower than the product's worth.  I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest while ensuring I receive a reasonable return.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but no higher. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's go with $11500. It's a fair price that considers both our positions. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think $10000 is a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,8,
