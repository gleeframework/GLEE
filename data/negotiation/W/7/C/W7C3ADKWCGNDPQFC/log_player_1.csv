Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price?

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $150. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest!  I can come down a bit, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $160?  This is a really good deal for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 160}

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer of $135 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price.  I've had 5 rounds of negotiation, and I'm not sure if I can get him to budge much further.  John is a sure thing at $150, which is a much better deal for me."
