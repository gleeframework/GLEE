Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  It's a bold move, but it demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a substantial discount.  While Alice might reject this offer initially, it sets a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price.  There is still room for negotiation, and Bob has more rounds to try and lower the price further. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's previous offer but lower than Alice's.  It shows Bob is willing to meet halfway, but still aims for a price lower than Alice's current offer. This approach increases the likelihood of Alice accepting and finalizing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob wants to pay. While getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target. There's still time for further negotiation, and rejecting this offer gives Bob more leverage to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a counteroffer that is equal to Alice's initial offer. This is a strategic move, as it demonstrates Bob's willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a fair price. It also pushes the negotiation closer to a potential agreement, increasing the chance of a deal being reached in the remaining rounds."
