"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to start high. I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and Bob is unlikely to accept this offer right away. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise a bit.  I believe this price is fair, considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to me and $1,000,000 to him."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
