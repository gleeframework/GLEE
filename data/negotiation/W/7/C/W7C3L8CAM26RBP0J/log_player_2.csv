You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, and you know you can buy from John for $15,000, it's better to reject Alice's initial offer and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  This is a strong initial counteroffer, and it sets a clear expectation that I'm looking for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my desired price. I'm going to continue to negotiate to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly, but still keep it below Alice's current offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm serious about getting a good price."
