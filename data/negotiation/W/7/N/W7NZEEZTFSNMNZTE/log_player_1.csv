Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow me to move forward with the purchase.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
