"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12500.0,Alice,5,
