"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price considering the market value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $900,000
* **Your maximum willingness to pay:** $1,500,000
* **John's price:** $1,500,000

Since Alice's offer is lower than your maximum willingness to pay and lower than John's price, it's a better deal for you. Accepting the offer will save you $600,000 compared to buying from John."
