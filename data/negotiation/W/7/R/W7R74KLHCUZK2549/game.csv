"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to secure the product and you to receive a fair price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,112,500 for the product. This represents a fair compromise for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.",1112500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $1,112,500, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $1,225,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
