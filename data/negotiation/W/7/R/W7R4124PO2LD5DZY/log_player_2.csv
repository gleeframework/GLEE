# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Considering its value and your interest, I propose we make it yours for $100. This is a special offer tailored to appreciate your interest and ensure you receive a great deal. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a product valued at $120 for a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price. Alice might return with a lower offer to avoid losing the sale. If not, you can always buy from John for $120."
