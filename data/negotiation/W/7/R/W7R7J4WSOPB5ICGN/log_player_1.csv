Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob only values the product at $80, it's best to start with a price closer to your minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation or allows you to slightly decrease the price to entice Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $120 suggests a potential for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you the opportunity to either meet in the middle or still secure a price higher than John's offer.
* **Balancing profit and risk:** Offering it for $120 gives you a $40 profit if Bob accepts.  If Bob rejects, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150."
