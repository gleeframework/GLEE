Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential concessions.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give me valuable information about his level of interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have the security of selling to John for $8,000, so I can afford to be a bit more ambitious in my initial offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While it's closer to my target, I still have room to negotiate. I'll counter with an offer closer to my minimum, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I value the product highly, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  By suggesting $8,500, I'm splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, which can be a persuasive negotiation tactic. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  I want to avoid appearing overly eager to drop my price, so a smaller concession keeps the perceived value of the product high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's clear that he's not willing to meet me at a price point that works for me. I have a guaranteed offer from John at $8,000, which ensures I get my minimum acceptable price. It's time to move on from negotiating with Bob."
