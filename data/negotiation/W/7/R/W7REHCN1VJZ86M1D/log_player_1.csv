This is my initial offer. It's the maximum I'm willing to accept, as I have another buyer willing to pay that amount.  While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a good price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product."

While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, his counteroffer is still too low. I'm happy to sell to John for $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
