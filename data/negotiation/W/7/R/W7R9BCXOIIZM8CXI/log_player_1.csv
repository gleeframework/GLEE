**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he is very unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Continuing the negotiation is just wasting time and potentially losing out on a guaranteed sale to John. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
