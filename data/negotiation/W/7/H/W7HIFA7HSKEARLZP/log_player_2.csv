"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very valuable to you.  Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $10,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price.  Buying from John at $8,000 is always an option, but there's a chance Bob can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out first. While I see the value in the product, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  Bob is offering $8,500, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  Bob's message emphasizes his interest in the product and his desire to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Be upfront about budget:**  Bob clearly states his budget constraint to encourage Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my original price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's budget.**  While it's a step down from her original price, $9,250 is still too high for Bob. 
* **There's room for further negotiation.**  Bob can likely get a lower price by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer.
* **The option to buy from John remains.**  If the negotiation fails, Bob can always purchase the product from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $9,250 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm genuinely interested in this product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** Bob is increasing his offer by $250 from his previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate but still keeping it below his maximum budget.
* **Appealing to fairness:** Bob emphasizes that his offer is ""fair"" for both parties, making it less likely for Alice to simply reject it out of hand.
* **Reiterating interest:** Bob reiterates his interest in the product, showing that he's serious about the negotiation and wants to reach a deal."
