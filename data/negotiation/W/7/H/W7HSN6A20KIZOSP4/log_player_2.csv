Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  Let's try $1,050,000. I believe this price still represents a good value for you, given the potential of this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're getting closer to my desired price.  However, $950,000 is still a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $975,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of this product, and I believe it will be a great investment for you.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

``` 
Alice's offer is a good compromise. It's still slightly more than I wanted to pay, but it's less than what I'd pay for John's product.  I'm going to accept the offer."
