"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that we both agree on. I'm also being friendly and encouraging, hoping to foster a positive relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $175 is way too high for me.  I'm only willing to pay $80 for your product.  That's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $110.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $110 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept this, I'm going to have to buy from John instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and Bob's offer is still below what I believe the product is worth.  Rather than continue to negotiate with him, I'll sell the product to John for $150, which guarantees me a good profit."
