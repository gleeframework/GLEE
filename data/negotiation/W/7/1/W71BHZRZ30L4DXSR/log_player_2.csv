# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still higher than what John is offering. You can save $1,500 by going with John."
