(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a profit, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $80, so how about $82.50? That way, we can both be happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
