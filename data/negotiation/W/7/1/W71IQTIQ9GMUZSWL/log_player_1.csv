Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet. But I can't go much lower than this.  $978,125 just doesn't work for me.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not high enough to make this worthwhile for me.  With John offering a guaranteed $1,200,000, it's the best option available. I'm willing to walk away from the negotiation with Bob to secure this deal."
