"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a steal at this price, considering its true value.  Let's make this deal happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in your product, and I'm prepared to pay $900000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1100000? This still leaves room for both of us to profit, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $950000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our need to come to an agreement. Let's get this deal done.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to finding a deal, and I appreciate that.  $950000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1050000? That's a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm getting closer to your price, $1050000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $1000000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's finalize this deal and call it a day.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
