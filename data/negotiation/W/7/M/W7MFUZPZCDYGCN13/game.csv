"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, $1,400,000 is below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000.  This reflects the product's unique benefits and the potential return on investment it offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
