{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to me, and I believe it holds great value for you as well.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,750,000.  This price reflects the product's potential, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for your business.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still below my minimum. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, $1,400,000 is below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000.  This reflects the product's unique benefits and the potential return on investment it offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already reached my 4th round. It's best to secure the deal with John now as further negotiation with Bob might take too long."
