"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product looks promising, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a purchase price of $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  To be frank, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $1,100,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is closer to a fair price, I'm still seeking something a bit higher. How about we settle at $950,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $950,000 is still too high for me. My final offer is $800,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
