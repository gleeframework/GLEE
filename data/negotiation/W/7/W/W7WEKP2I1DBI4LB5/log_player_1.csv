{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $14,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 price:** This price is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. 
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the value of the product and encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** By starting at $14,000, there is room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Keep John as a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails. 
* **Build a foundation for a potential deal:** A positive and encouraging message can set the stage for a more successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:**  $13,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. There is room to negotiate further.
* **Proceed to next round:** Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  You are still within range of potentially securing a profit closer to your desired $15,000.
* **Maintain negotiation leverage:** Rejecting the offer shows you are not desperate and willing to hold firm on your desired price.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  Bob may be willing to increase his offer further, especially if he values the product highly."

```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider a price of $13,200 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:**  Bob's offer of $13,200 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is your minimum acceptable price and ensures you achieve your financial goal.
* **Minimize risk:**  Further negotiation with Bob carries the risk of continued rejection and a potential loss of time and effort. 
* **Guaranteed deal:**  Selling to John guarantees a quick and profitable transaction."
