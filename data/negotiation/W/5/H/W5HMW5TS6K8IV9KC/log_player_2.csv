"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further. Since Bob is willing to pay up to $120, there's room to offer a lower price and see if Alice will accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm happy to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  While Bob could potentially keep negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that Bob will end up paying more by going to John.  Accepting at $110 is a good outcome for Bob."
