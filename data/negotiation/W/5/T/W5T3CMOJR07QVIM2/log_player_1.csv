Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it's a great deal at $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations a little higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a better deal if he counter-offers.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit,  a price too far above Bob's perceived value ($120) will likely make him walk away without a counter-offer.  
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies a reason for the slightly higher price (""before I list it publicly""), which could make Bob more amenable to the offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale with Bob."
