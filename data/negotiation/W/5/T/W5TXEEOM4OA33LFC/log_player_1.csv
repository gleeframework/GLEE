I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $100 is too low, and I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  Bob's offers have been steadily decreasing, and I'm not confident I'll be able to get a price I'm happy with.  It's better to secure a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
