"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I'd need at least $110 to make this work.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
