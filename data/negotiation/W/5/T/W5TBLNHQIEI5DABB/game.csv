"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,300,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,375,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $1,325,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
