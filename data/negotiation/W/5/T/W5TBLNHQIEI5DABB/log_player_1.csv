Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,450,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation while still maximizing potential profit. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as fair and appealing, highlighting the value to Bob. This helps establish a positive negotiation tone. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** This offer sets the stage for a negotiation that aims to get as close to Bob's estimated value of $1,500,000 as possible.
* **Backup Option:** Having John's offer of $1,200,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. This allows me to be assertive in negotiations without fear of losing out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and  far below my desired profit margin. I need to push for a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,300,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $1,375,000 is a compromise that bridges the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging his budget constraints while emphasizing the value of the product to him. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while staying above my minimum acceptable price. It also signals my commitment to finding a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,375,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $1,325,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is only $25,000 lower than my counteroffer. 
* **Risk:**  Rejecting his offer and making a new counteroffer could risk losing him entirely.  
* **Opportunity Cost:**  It's important to consider that continuing to negotiate could take more time, potentially leading to a better offer, but also the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. 

**Conclusion:** 
It's strategically sound to accept Bob's offer.  It's a good price that allows for a decent profit while minimizing risk and maximizing my opportunity to secure a sale."
