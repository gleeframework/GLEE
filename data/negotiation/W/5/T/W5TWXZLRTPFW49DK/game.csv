"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm ready to offer you $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
