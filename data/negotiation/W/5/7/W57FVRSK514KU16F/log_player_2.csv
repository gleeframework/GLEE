"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $8,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $9,000, which is $1,000 more than its value to me. I'd rather buy it from John for $8,000.
