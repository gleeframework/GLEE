Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value you've identified in it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** He's willing to pay $1,200,000, so $1,400,000 gives him some room to negotiate while still being profitable for you.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're not willing to go below $1,500,000, so you have a clear limit for counteroffers.
* **It's a good opening offer:** It shows you're willing to negotiate but also value your product.

This strategy allows you to:

* **Maximize your earnings:** You start high, leaving space for a potential compromise.
* **Avoid unnecessary negotiations:** You're willing to sell to John, so you don't need to endlessly negotiate if Bob isn't agreeable."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, it's not worth sacrificing $300,000. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to risk a few rounds of counteroffers to achieve that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 as a compromise. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, especially considering the time and effort involved. John is a guaranteed buyer at my desired price, and I don't want to miss out on that opportunity."
