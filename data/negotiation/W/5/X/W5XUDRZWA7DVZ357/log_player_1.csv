Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit. If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than $100, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a profit higher than $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $135, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and $125 is a good price that allows me to make a profit.  Further negotiation may lead to more rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and ending up with the lower price from John."
