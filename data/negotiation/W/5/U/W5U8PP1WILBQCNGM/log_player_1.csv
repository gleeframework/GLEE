{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,500,000), but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also reminding Bob that we both stand to gain from this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I would like to close the deal with Bob, I'm not willing to compromise so significantly.  I'll counteroffer him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This still allows for a good profit for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is the maximum I can afford, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it seems like we've reached a point where further negotiation might be futile.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further haggling or losing the deal entirely."
