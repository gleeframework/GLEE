"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good starting point and leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will find the value proposition compelling, but I'm also leaving myself open to counteroffers and a potential deal that benefits us both."

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to compromise.  I think this price is still attractive for him, given his perceived value of $1,500,000, and it's significantly closer to my target than his last offer."
