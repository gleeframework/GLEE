Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
