"Bob, I believe this product has immense value, and I'm offering it to you at $1,200,000.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will deliver a strong return.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price, considering my budget and the value I'm looking to get out of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, acknowledging your budget while still ensuring I receive a fair return.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. I'm thinking $950,000 is a more comfortable price range for me. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still needing to secure a price that covers my investment and allows for a reasonable profit.  I'm prepared to go down to $1,050,000. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $980,000 or lower. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider $980,000?",980000.0,Bob,6,
