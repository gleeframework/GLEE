I'm starting high, aiming for the full value of the product to me. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and we can negotiate from there. If he doesn't accept my initial offer, I'll keep the negotiation going until I get a price I'm comfortable with, or I can always sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer, but still below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, but still aiming for a price closer to my value. This should be a good compromise and encourage him to accept the offer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough.  I'm confident that I can sell to John for a higher price, so I'll take that option."
