Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 (because John guarantees that price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have strong leverage.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 gives you room to negotiate down while staying above your minimum.
* **Confident Tone:**  The language suggests the product's high value and your confidence in the offer.
* **""Fair Price"" Framing:** This encourages Bob to see the negotiation from a win-win perspective, even though the price is significantly above his perceived value.

**Important Note:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before walking away and selling to John."
