"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12000 to you, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12500? That way, we both get a fair price and we can close this deal. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12250?",12250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit too high for me to accept. I'm willing to go down to $12375. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll get a great product for a fair price. Let me know what you think!",12375.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal.  How about we split the difference again and go with $12250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",12250.0,Alice,7,
