"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $108?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
