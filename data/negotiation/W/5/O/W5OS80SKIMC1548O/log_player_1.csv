Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will bite at a price just below that. 
* **High Starting Point:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Appear Reasonable:** While close to my minimum, the slightly lower price might make Bob feel like he's getting a deal."
