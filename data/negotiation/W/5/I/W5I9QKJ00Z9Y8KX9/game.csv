"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1800000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. I believe this price is fair considering its worth. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1800000. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1500000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the discount you've already offered.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to get the feeling you're not serious about buying this product. $1100000 is simply not a fair price.  I'm willing to compromise one last time and offer it for $1300000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and frankly, I'm starting to think selling to John is a better option.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to compromise, but $1300000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. I'm getting close to walking away and buying from John, but I still think this product is worth it to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
