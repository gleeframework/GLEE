Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get the feeling you're not serious about buying this product. $1100000 is simply not a fair price.  I'm willing to compromise one last time and offer it for $1300000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and frankly, I'm starting to think selling to John is a better option.
