"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its inherent worth and potential for you."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique features and benefits"" and ""inherent worth"" helps to anchor the value in Bob's mind, even if he ultimately negotiates down.
* **Leaving John as a Backup:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob. It's too early to settle for John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than our initial asking price and well below our minimum acceptable price. We have room to negotiate, and we're willing to bet Bob might be willing to go higher, especially since he expressed strong interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  It seems we both recognize the significant value of this product. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $2,100,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still valuing the product fairly."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're reducing our price by $200,000, showing Bob we're flexible and serious about making a deal. 
* **Staying Above Target:** This counteroffer keeps us well above both Bob's offer and our $1,500,000 minimum, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Positive Language:** We continue to emphasize the ""value"" of the product and our desire to ""find a middle ground,"" fostering a collaborative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a non-starter. It's below his own initial valuation of the product and significantly less than half our initial asking price. We need to send a strong signal that we're serious about our valuation.  While John's offer is becoming more tempting, we still have room to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but your current offer falls significantly short of the product's true value. Let's be realistic â€“ I'm offering to sell it for less than half my initial asking price, and it's still a substantial amount more than you're currently proposing.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a very competitive offer and a clear indication of my willingness to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer conveys that we're serious about the negotiation but willing to be flexible within reason.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're reiterating that Bob's offer is far below the product's worth, reminding him of what he stands to gain.
* **Significant Drop:**  The substantial price decrease ($200,000)  demonstrates our eagerness to reach an agreement. 
* **Time Pressure:** With fewer rounds remaining, this offer creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to respond more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close! While Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is his highest yet, it's still below our $1,900,000 counteroffer. We need to hold firm and see if we can push him a bit further in the remaining rounds. We're still above John's offer, and walking away now could mean leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're clearly nearing a point where we can make this work for both of us. You've come up significantly from your initial offer, which shows you truly see the value this product offers.  To bridge the remaining gap, I'm proposing $1,825,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair and attractive price for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** We're making it clear this is our last move, adding a sense of urgency for Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:**  We're meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and our previous counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a favorable price.
* **Strong Value Proposition:** We're reminding Bob of the product's value and reinforcing the attractiveness of our offer. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only three rounds left, this offer encourages a decision from Bob, as delaying could mean losing out on the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already offered $1,700,000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. Here's why:

* **Strong Offer:** $1,700,000 is a significant amount and considerably more than our guaranteed offer from John. 
* **Finality:** Bob has signaled that this is his best offer.  Attempting to negotiate further might push him away.
* **Time:** We have very few rounds left. Continuing to haggle risks losing Bob without securing a better deal elsewhere. 

While we could push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential for marginal gains. Accepting Bob's offer secures a very profitable outcome."
