,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  It seems we both recognize the significant value of this product. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $2,100,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still valuing the product fairly.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but your current offer falls significantly short of the product's true value. Let's be realistic â€“ I'm offering to sell it for less than half my initial asking price, and it's still a substantial amount more than you're currently proposing.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a very competitive offer and a clear indication of my willingness to close this deal.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're clearly nearing a point where we can make this work for both of us. You've come up significantly from your initial offer, which shows you truly see the value this product offers.  To bridge the remaining gap, I'm proposing $1,825,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair and attractive price for a product of this caliber.",1825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already offered $1,700,000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1700000.0,Bob,8,
