{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $12,000, but I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $10,000. This offer leaves room for negotiation and hopefully leads to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000.  While it's tempting to accept, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  This would still be a good deal for you, as you value the product at $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,800 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I would like to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make one final counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my need to cover my costs.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 10000}
