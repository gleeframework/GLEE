"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is an exceptional value, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John."
