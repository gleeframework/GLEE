"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good deal.  It also signals to Bob that I am serious about selling but I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000 with further negotiation.  I want to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm countering with $975,000. This is a smaller step down from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but not desperate.  It also puts the pressure on Bob to make a decision as we're getting closer to a deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $925,000 is still a decent price, I'm not willing to drop below $950,000 yet. There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal. I want to maximize my earnings, and selling to John at this point would be less beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise, but I'm sticking to my bottom line. This shows Bob I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm not willing to go lower. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is getting closer to my bottom line, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. We're nearing the halfway point, and I want to maximize my profit.  There are still rounds left to work with Bob.  Selling to John would mean a significant loss in earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm countering with $925,000. This is a small compromise to show flexibility, but I'm not willing to drop too much further.  I'm still confident that Bob is motivated to buy, and I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $875,000 is getting close to my bottom line, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal.  We only have two rounds left, and I want to maximize my profit.  Selling to John at this point would mean a significant loss in earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

This is my final offer.  I'm taking a significant risk here, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and close the deal.  I'm confident in my price and I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't accept. Selling to John would be a huge loss for me, so I'm pushing for this deal to go through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough decision.  While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, Bob is clearly not willing to go higher.  It's down to the wire, and I need to secure a sale.  Selling to John for $800,000 is a significant loss, but it's better than nothing and at least guarantees me some profit."
