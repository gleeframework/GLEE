Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,500."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,500 allows a small buffer for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  It's crucial that the offer is significantly higher than John's $10,000 offer to ensure you maximize your potential profit.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, who values the product more, while still leaving you with a substantial profit margin."
