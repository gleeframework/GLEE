{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to encourage him to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room to come down in price if necessary, while still ensuring a profit margin that's comfortable for me.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging, emphasizing the value of the product.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great!  We have a deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer, considering his potential value and my bottom line.  I'll aim for a price closer to $1,500,000, but will be flexible based on the negotiation.
* **If the negotiation stalls:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial financial loss.
* **Opportunity to Negotiate:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation.  I can make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I know that I can sell the product to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept Bob's low offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target.  I will consider factors like his perceived value and my desired profit margin.
* If Bob continues to offer low prices, I will be prepared to walk away and sell to John, ensuring a better outcome for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still leaves room for you to profit and ensures that I receive a fair return. Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still ensuring a decent profit for myself.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefits:** I'm emphasizing that the price I'm proposing allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. 
* **Remaining Firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to drop below $1,100,000.  I'm confident that this price is still attractive to Bob, given his perceived value of the product.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** We have a deal! 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess his next offer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if it's time to sell to John.
* **If negotiations stall:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest offer. How about we settle on $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even though Bob has met me halfway, I believe there is still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer is My Backup:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000 or even higher, depending on how confident I feel in my negotiating position.
* **Assess Bob's Response:**  I will carefully analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he rejects it again, I will need to decide if it's time to accept his offer, negotiate further, or go with John's offer."
