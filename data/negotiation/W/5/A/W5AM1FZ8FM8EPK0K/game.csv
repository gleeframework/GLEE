"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'd like to try to get as close to my target price as possible. Can you consider meeting me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $10,500 for the product.  This would still be a great deal for you, as you value the product at $10,000. Let's split the difference and see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",10000.0,Bob,4,
