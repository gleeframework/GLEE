,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you be willing to do $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I'm confident this product is worth that much to you, and it's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $92.50? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",92.5,Bob,4,
