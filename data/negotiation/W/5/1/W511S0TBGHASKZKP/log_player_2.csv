"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), but it's still higher than Bob's maximum acceptable price ($1,500,000).** 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to explore other options.** While buying from John would be the most expensive option, it's still within Bob's budget and provides more room for negotiation."
