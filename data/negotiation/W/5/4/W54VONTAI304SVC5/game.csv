"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to save a bit of money. Can you consider my offer?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",82.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $82.50. How about $81.25?",81.25,Bob,4,
