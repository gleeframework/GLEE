Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $11,500 is more than the $10,000 Bob values the product at, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's below your $12,000 minimum, leaving room for negotiation without immediately cutting into your profit. 

This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation where you can potentially secure a price closer to your desired $12,000."
