"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and maximize my profit.  Let's see if Bob is willing to play ball!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm hoping I can get closer to my initial asking price with some counter-offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is still above my minimum, but it's a compromise from my initial offer.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm getting close to my desired price. Accepting $9,200 is a good deal and less risky than continuing to negotiate. I might not get a better offer, and I'm running out of rounds."
