Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming to get more than $8,000, and $9,500 is a good starting point.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, giving him room to negotiate a lower price. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This gives you flexibility if Bob wants to negotiate further.

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response and your desire to close the deal quickly or get the highest possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $9000?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is close to your minimum and a decent offer, it's still worth trying to get a little closer to your target price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:**  You're acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price while still aiming for a higher price than his last offer.
* **Is still above your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  There's still a little wiggle room if Bob wants to counter again.

Remember, this is just a suggestion. You can adjust the price based on your own assessment of the situation and how likely you think Bob is to accept."
