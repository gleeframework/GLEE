"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $9,500. He is willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice's minimum is $8,000.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $9,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $9250? It's a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $9,250, which is closer to Bob's ideal price point of $9,000.
* Buying from John would cost Bob $10,000, so accepting Alice's offer saves $750.
* It's reasonable to assume that Alice might not be willing to go lower, as she's already conceded some ground."
