Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that this product has the potential to be very valuable to me. Let's find a way to make this work.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my sincere interest in this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a consistent unwillingness to move substantially from his offer around $850,000. While his counteroffer of $950,000 is a slight improvement, it's highly unlikely he will reach the $1,000,000 mark that guarantees you break even at your minimum acceptable price.  

Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures you avoid further negotiation and secure a guaranteed sale at your baseline.  It's time to cut your losses with Bob and move forward with a sure thing."
