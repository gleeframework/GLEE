Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is only possible if you find a price within the ZOPA.

**The Strategy**

Since Bob's maximum price is lower than your minimum, you have two options:

1. **High Anchor and Hope:**  Offer a price significantly higher than $1,200,000 hoping Bob might counter-offer within a range acceptable to you. This is risky as he might just reject outright. 
2. **Accept John's Offer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at your desired price, it's the safest option.

**The Offer (Choosing the safer option):**

It makes more sense to take the guaranteed offer from John in this scenario.  There's no point in negotiating with Bob when you already have a buyer willing to meet your desired price. 

**However, if you wanted to try negotiating with Bob (high risk), here's a sample offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Important Note:** This high-anchored offer is a gamble. Bob is very likely to reject it given the large difference between his valuation and your asking price."
