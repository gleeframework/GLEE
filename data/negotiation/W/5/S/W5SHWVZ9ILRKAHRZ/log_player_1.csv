Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the value in.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** A price of $2,000,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay above your minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial offer leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. This way, you're more likely to arrive at a price closer to your ideal outcome.
* **Confident Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions it as a unique opportunity, justifying the high price. 

**It's important to remember:** This is just an opening move.  Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
