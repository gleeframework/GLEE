Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I think might be of interest to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. It's a one-of-a-kind item, so this is a great opportunity to get something truly special. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my asking price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the unique value of this product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $13500. I'd be willing to meet you at $11000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is more than selling to John, I think I can still push for a higher price. I'm not sure if Bob will come back with another counteroffer, but I'm willing to risk it and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on $11,000, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, and that's my final offer. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is $10,000, which is the same price I can get from John right now.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point, as I'm unlikely to get a better price.  I'll sell the product to John to secure the deal."
