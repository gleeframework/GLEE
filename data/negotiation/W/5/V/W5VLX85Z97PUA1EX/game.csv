"Hello Bob, I have a product that I think might be of interest to you. I'm asking for $15000 for it. It's a one-of-a-kind item, so this is a great opportunity to get something truly special. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair compromise, considering the unique value of this product. Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $13500. I'd be willing to meet you at $11000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on $11000, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, and that's my final offer. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,6,
