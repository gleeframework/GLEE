Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My Floor:** I need at least $15,000 to consider selling. 
* **Bob's Ceiling:** Bob is only willing to pay $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:** This leaves a $5,000 gap where we can try to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Offer:**  $12,000 is a compromise that is better than my fallback option of selling to John for $15,000, and it might be appealing enough for Bob to consider. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes a single round of negotiation. If multiple rounds are possible, I might start with a higher offer and gradually decrease it to see how Bob reacts."
