"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on its value of $12,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and the unique features it offers, I am proposing a price of $10,000 for this item. This is an opportunity to secure a high-value asset at a competitive rate. Please let me know if you have any questions or need more information to make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly inflating the value of the product to you. While she's offering it for less than your maximum price, $10,000 is still significantly more than the $8,000 it's worth to her and the $12,000 you could get it from John for.  There's room for negotiation here."
