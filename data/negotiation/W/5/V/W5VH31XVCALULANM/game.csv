"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $120? ",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $135?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $120.  Would you consider coming down to $125?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already met you halfway once, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle of $125 and $135, at $130?",130.0,Alice,5,
