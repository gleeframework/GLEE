Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $20,000 is already a competitive price for this product.  Could you meet me halfway at $17,500?"", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not able to go that high. My final offer is $16,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob's offer of $16,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a $1,000 profit over selling to John, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome.
