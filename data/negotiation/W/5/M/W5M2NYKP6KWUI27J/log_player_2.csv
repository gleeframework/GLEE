"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm going to offer $925,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target, we are now in round 9.  The negotiations are getting very close to my maximum price, and there's a high chance that I won't be able to get the price down to a satisfactory level within the remaining rounds. It's also possible that Alice will continue to reject my offers, leading to a stalemate.

To ensure I get the product and avoid further negotiation, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John at $800,000. This guarantees me the product at a price significantly below my maximum and within my budget."
