"That's a bit out of my budget, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $12000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $12000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9500. I'm still a bit off from that though. How about we split the difference and settle on $10750? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit far from $10750. How about we meet at $9000? I'm trying to stay within my budget,9000.0,Bob,6,
