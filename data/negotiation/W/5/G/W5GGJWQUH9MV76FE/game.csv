"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. Considering the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $700,000. I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the worth of the product while still offering you a good deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This shows a good faith effort to find a middle ground.  Let's try to close this deal!",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",800000.0,Bob,6,
