"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This establishes a high anchor point for the negotiation.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" I aim to shift Bob's focus towards the product's benefits beyond just his initial valuation.
* **Openness:** I want Bob to understand I'm willing to negotiate, but it's important to start from a position that favors me.
* **John in my Back Pocket:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives me leverage. I'm not afraid to walk away if the deal doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is unfortunately above my budget. Given my maximum limit is $1,000,000, I'd like to propose a price of $1,000,000.  This allows for a significant profit for you while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived maximum value, leaving no room for negotiation upwards from his side. Accepting would mean a significant loss for me. While John offers a safety net, it's too early to walk away. I need to counter in a way that brings Bob closer to my range without scaring him off completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price reflects the exceptional value you're getting and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant drop from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. However, the new price still keeps me well above my minimum and allows room for further negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's ""true potential"" to steer Bob away from his fixed budget and toward the potential return on his investment.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  By positioning this price as a step towards a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" I'm signaling that I'm serious about finding a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  To reach a mutually agreeable price, I'm proposing $1,200,000. This offers you a good profit while allowing me to stay within my financial limitations. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved up considerably from his initial offer, indicating willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still significantly less than my $1,500,000 safety net. I believe there's room for him to go higher, so I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my target while still demonstrating flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, and we're getting closer. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects the significant value you're gaining while allowing me to achieve a fair return. I believe it's a strong step towards a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Concession:**  I'm making another significant drop, but this time it's smaller, showing I'm approaching my limit.
* **Reframing ""Fairness"":** I'm shifting the language from just ""profit"" to ""fair return,"" subtly emphasizing the value I'm offering.
* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap and encourage Bob to make a similar move upwards. It also puts some pressure on him, as I'm still significantly above his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which gives you a good profit while allowing me to remain within my limits. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Reserve:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, securing a profit. 
* **Strong Position:** We've gone back and forth, and this offer is a significant increase from his initial offer. He's clearly demonstrating a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away. Accepting now avoids potentially losing the deal and having to start over with a new buyer."
