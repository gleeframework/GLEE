Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is a significant jump, and it shows you're serious about this product. To be honest, though, taking anything less than $15,000 would be selling myself short. That's my absolute bottom line.  If you can meet that, we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.
