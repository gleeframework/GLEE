Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $9,000. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and your budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value and your budget. Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500. You can get the product for $8,000 from John, which is your target price.  There's no point in further negotiation with Alice."
