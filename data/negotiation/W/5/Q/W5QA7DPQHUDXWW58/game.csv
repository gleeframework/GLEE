"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $13,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $10,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value.",10000.0,Bob,4,
