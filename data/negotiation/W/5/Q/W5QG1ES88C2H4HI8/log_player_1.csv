"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a chance to gauge Bob's interest and potentially close the deal quickly. If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $130. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $110 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $110 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - $120 is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 120}
