Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My price is $140, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $140 is higher than $80, but not so high that it's immediately rejected.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It's easy for Bob to understand the offer. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price of $150.  It's important to remember that John is willing to pay my minimum, so I can afford to be firm in negotiations with Bob.  

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which still gives you a great deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $100.  
* **Still above my minimum:** $120 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't lose too much money. 
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message emphasizes Bob's interest in the product and expresses my willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground and hopefully secure a deal that is favorable for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my minimum but is still significantly below my desired price.  At this point, I've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my expectations.  

Rather than continue to haggle and potentially risk getting stuck with a lower price, it's more advantageous for me to sell the product to John for $150. This guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further delays."
