"Thanks for the offer Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering its true value to you is $8,000. I think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is fair to both of us.  Let's close the deal at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle at $9,200.",9200.0,Alice,5,
