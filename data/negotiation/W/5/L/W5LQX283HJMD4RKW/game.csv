"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Let's find a middle ground.  How about $2,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,950,000 is still quite a distance from what I had in mind.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $2,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my end and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",2050000.0,Alice,5,
