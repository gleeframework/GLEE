Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $950,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a relatively high price, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay it since it's still a significant discount from the true value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $900,000. Since this is still below the true value of the product to him, I'll decide to reject his offer and try to get a better price.

I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer, but still lower than the true value of the product to him.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
{""counteroffer"": $925,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $925,000. This is a slightly higher price than his original offer, and I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer and made a counteroffer of $900,000, and I rejected his offer and sent a counteroffer of $925,000, the game continues.

Here's my next move:

{""product_price"": $925,000}

I'm sticking to my previous counteroffer of $925,000. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this price, but if not, I'm prepared to make another counteroffer or even consider selling the product to John for $1,000,000."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob rejected my counteroffer of $925,000 and made a new offer of $920,000. Since this is still below the true value of the product to him, I'll decide to reject his offer and try to get a better price.

I'll send Bob a new counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer, but still lower than the true value of the product to him.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
