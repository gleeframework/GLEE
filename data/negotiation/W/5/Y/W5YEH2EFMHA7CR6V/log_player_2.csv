"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,400,000 is still above Bob's maximum price.
* **There's room for negotiation.** It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price. 
* **John's offer is a backup.**  While John's price is higher, it provides a safety net if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a significant concession. This price still allows me to get a good return on my investment. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal target. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  The gap between Bob's offer and Alice's is narrowing. It's worth trying to push Alice down further. 
* **John's offer remains a safety net.**  Bob can still buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about $1,280,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and we could both walk away happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price.** Bob is trying to stay below $1,250,000.
* **There's still room to negotiate.** The gap between Bob and Alice is closing, and it's worth seeing if a final counteroffer can secure a better price.
* **John's offer is a fallback.**  While it's higher, it provides a secure option if negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a bit more, but $1,280,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,260,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the very last offer I can make.  If you accept, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1260000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,270,000. This is a very small gap, and I believe it shows my commitment to closing this deal. Let's get this done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's target.** The $1,270,000 price is only $10,000 above Bob's last offer.
* **Negotiation has reached a stalemate.** It's unlikely Bob can get a much lower price without risking the deal falling apart.
* **John's offer is still a backup.**  If Alice rejects the offer, Bob can still buy from John, but at a higher price.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible decision. It's a good price, and further negotiation might not lead to a significantly better outcome."
