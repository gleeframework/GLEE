,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a significant concession. This price still allows me to get a good return on my investment. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about $1,280,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and we could both walk away happy with the deal.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a bit more, but $1,280,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,260,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the very last offer I can make.  If you accept, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1260000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,270,000. This is a very small gap, and I believe it shows my commitment to closing this deal. Let's get this done!",1270000.0,Alice,7,
