"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, that price is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $7,500? That would make it possible for me to move forward.",7500.0,Bob,4,
