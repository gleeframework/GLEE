Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,250. It's my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her $10,250 offer.  Since you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, it's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John. You've attempted to negotiate a better price, but it's not worth the risk of Alice sticking to her price or even increasing it."
