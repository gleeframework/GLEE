"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,250. It's my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
