Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000. Offering it slightly below his valuation maximizes potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a higher offer to Bob.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is concise and highlights the product's value to Bob."
