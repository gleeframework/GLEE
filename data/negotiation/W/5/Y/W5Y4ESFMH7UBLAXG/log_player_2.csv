"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

``` 

**Explanation:**

* You want to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer is $12,000, while your maximum budget is $15,000. 
* There's room to negotiate further, as Alice is likely willing to sell for less than $12,000. 
* Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal considering your maximum budget is $15,000. 
* While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you having to buy from John for $15,000 is significant.
* Accepting this offer saves you $3,500 compared to buying from John."
