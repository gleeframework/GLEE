"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I do think the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay at this point. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,
