"Alice, $22,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could come down to $18,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hopeful we can find common ground. I'm prepared to offer $12,000. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I'm getting closer to a price I can accept, but $12,000 is still quite a ways off. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This would be a significant discount on my initial asking price.",16000.0,Alice,5,
