"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $8,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to make a fair profit, but I'm still not comfortable paying $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? That way, we can both get a good deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
