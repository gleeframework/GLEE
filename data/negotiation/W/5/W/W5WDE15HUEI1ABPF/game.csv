,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to meet you halfway. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's make this deal happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting very close. However, I can only accept $8,650. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. If you agree, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",8650.0,Alice,7,
