"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Room for Counteroffer:** By leaving a bit of wiggle room, I encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, there's still potential to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Staying in the Game:** Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and explore if I can get a higher price from Bob.
* **John is a Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal from Bob.  I'm not desperate to sell immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, I'm aiming for a bit closer to my original asking price.  How about $9,500? That's still a great deal for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Counteroffer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price closer to his counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.
* **Strategic Adjustment:**  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but also not willing to give away the farm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your new offer. How about $9,250? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I can still potentially get more. 
* **Strategic approach:** By rejecting, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to continue negotiating.
* **Backup plan:** John's offer provides a safety net, allowing me to take my time and ensure I get the best deal possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $9,400?  It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 9400} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Maintain Value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product, reminding Bob that the price is fair.
* **Small Adjustment:** This small increase shows I'm not desperate but am willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your original asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price range. Accepting would mean a profit of $200, which is a good outcome.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob entirely and having to sell to John at a lower profit. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's a good time to lock in a profit."
