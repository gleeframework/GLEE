"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. What are your thoughts?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to finalize the deal immediately.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
