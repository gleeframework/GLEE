"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob's goal is to save money, and $1,200,000 is more than he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. While she has lowered the price, it's still above his target.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still giving me a good deal. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is $1,050,000, which is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, saving him $50,000 compared to accepting Alice's offer.  While further negotiation with Alice might be possible, the risk of not reaching an agreement and missing out on the product altogether is too high."
