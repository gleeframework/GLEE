I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to Bob than it is to me.  I'm confident that we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $14,000. This is a compromise, but still closer to my initial offer.  I believe we can come to an agreement at this price, as it's still a good deal for Bob considering the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good deal, considering he's already rejected two of my offers.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
