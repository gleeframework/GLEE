"Alice, your offer is a great starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price, as it provides you with a substantial profit and still represents a significant savings for me compared to John's offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000.  Let's try $800,000.  This price would be fair for both of us, allowing you a good profit and ensuring I get a significant savings. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I've already reached my minimum acceptable price, which is $850,000. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you at $815,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",815000.0,Alice,5,
