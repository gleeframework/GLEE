"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I believe that price is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however, we're still quite a distance apart in terms of valuation. This product has significant value and potential, as we discussed.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. I think this represents a fair compromise, allowing you to capitalize on the product's potential while acknowledging its inherent worth.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're driving a hard bargain!  While $1,087,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to be a bit closer to $1.1 million. Would you be willing to consider $1,125,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional value.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind. I'd be willing to go up to $1,100,000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
