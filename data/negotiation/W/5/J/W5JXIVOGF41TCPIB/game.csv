,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. That's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $90 as a final compromise.  Think about it - you're getting a valuable product for a fair price. Let's make this happen!",90.0,Alice,5,
