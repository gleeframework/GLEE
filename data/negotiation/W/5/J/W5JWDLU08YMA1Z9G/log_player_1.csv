Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This allows for some negotiation space while still ensuring I make a decent profit. 
* The message is friendly and direct, setting the stage for potential negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that benefits both of us. It's important to remember that:

* **My goal is to maximize profit**, but I need to be realistic about what Bob is willing to pay.
* **There's always the option of selling to John**, which provides a safety net. 
* **Negotiation takes time and effort**. I need to weigh the potential benefit of a higher price against the cost of continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. It also doesn't leave much room for negotiation. 
* While I want to earn as much as possible, I'm not desperate. 
* Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome, which is appealing. However, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is lower than I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $10,500 is a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly but firm. It acknowledges Bob's offer while highlighting that $10,500 is a more reasonable price.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to encourage Bob to accept while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.  I'm trying to build a sense of urgency by demonstrating flexibility while keeping the price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $9,800 is closer to my minimum than his previous offer, it's still far from my desired price point.  
* **The Risk of Accepting:**  Accepting now would mean selling for less than I ideally want, and the profit margin is slim.
* **The Potential of a Better Deal:**  I'm not yet desperate. I still have the option of selling to John, and there's a chance I can negotiate a slightly better price from Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while leaving some room for compromise. I'll need to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  $9,800 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I can't go that low just yet.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still offering you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My offer of $10,000 is a compromise, bridging the gap between my previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's current offer of $9,800. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and persuasive. It acknowledges Bob's budget constraints while highlighting the benefits of the price for both parties.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to my desired price point while still leaving room for negotiation if necessary. 

**Considerations:**

* **Risk of Losing Bob:** There's a risk that Bob might reject this offer and walk away. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The longer we negotiate, the more time I'm losing to potentially sell to John at a higher price.

This counteroffer is a strategic move aimed at finding a mutually agreeable solution while remaining within my acceptable price range."
