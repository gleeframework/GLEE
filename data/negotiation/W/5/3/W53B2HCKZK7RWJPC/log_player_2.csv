Alice's offer:

While $14,500 is closer to your target, it's still higher than your ideal price. You can try to negotiate further and see if you can reach an agreement closer to $13,000."

While you were hoping for a lower price, Alice is firm at $14,000. It's still a good deal compared to buying from John for $15,000. Accepting Alice's offer is the best decision here."
