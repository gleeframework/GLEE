"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $115 is close to my $100 limit, I know Alice is trying to make a profit. Rejecting her initial offer allows me to counter and potentially get a better price, closer to my budget. I'm willing to negotiate a bit before resorting to buying from John at $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?  I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This strategy:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It allows for some back-and-forth where we can hopefully meet in the middle.
* **Signals my budget:**  While I don't want to reveal my absolute limit ($100), offering $90 suggests I'm looking for a deal.
* **Maintains a polite and interested tone:** I don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away from the negotiation entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $105 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it offers. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my acceptable price, but I'm still not at my limit.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get her price down further. There's still room for negotiation before I have to buy from John at $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about $97?  That's a pretty significant increase from my last offer, and I'm getting closer to my limit."",
""product_price"": 97
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but not by a large amount. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Near my limit:**  Offering $97 puts me just below my absolute maximum.  This keeps me in the game while putting a little pressure on Alice. 
* **Transparency:** I'm hinting that I'm near my limit without revealing the exact number. This might encourage Alice to accept, knowing I might walk away soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $101 for the product.  This price still gives you a great value for the product, and it's fair to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $101, which is only $1 over my budget. At this point, the potential savings of further negotiation are minimal. Accepting this offer is the best choice because:

* **Minimal loss:** Spending $1 over budget is a small price difference for the convenience of securing the product now.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I counter again and Alice rejects it, I risk her raising the price or me running out of rounds and having to buy from John at my maximum price anyway. 
* **Time saved:** Accepting now avoids further back-and-forth and potential delays in getting the product."
