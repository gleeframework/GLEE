"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($100) and above Bob's perceived value ($80).  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to see if I can get Bob to budge closer to my desired price.  I'll be prepared to adjust my offer if necessary, but I want to see if he'll counter first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, so I believe there's room for a counteroffer that will get us closer to a mutually agreeable price. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim to bridge the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer, but I'll stay firm on not selling below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $105 is halfway between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $80.  This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" Bob is getting, focusing on the value of the product.
* **Testing the Waters:**  I'm aiming to gauge Bob's willingness to move up closer to my minimum acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if he rejects it.  I'll keep in mind the possibility of selling to John if no agreement can be reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on $80, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below My Minimum:**  $92.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** Although Bob is getting closer to my desired price, there's still room for me to counter and potentially secure a better deal.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer of $100 is tempting,  I still have time to try and get a better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim to meet Bob halfway again, but I'll be careful not to fall below my minimum.  I'll also keep in mind the possibility of selling to John if Bob continues to be unwilling to meet my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $97.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Again):**  I'm again offering to meet Bob halfway between my previous offer ($105) and his latest offer ($92.50). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate that this price is still fair for Bob, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Closing the Deal:** I use a positive and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer and close the deal.

**Strategy:**

I believe this offer is a good compromise that will hopefully entice Bob to accept. However, I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary, but I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $97.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $92.50.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We've reached round 6, and I'm getting close to the limit of 10 rounds. There's a risk that I'll end up with nothing if I keep going back and forth with Bob.
* **John's Offer is a Safe Bet:** John is offering me my minimum acceptable price ($100). This is a guaranteed sale, and I'm not likely to get a better offer from Bob at this point.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but he's stuck on his price of $92.50, which is still below my desired minimum.

**Strategy:**

To avoid potential losses or a drawn-out negotiation, I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him.  This is the most secure and reliable option at this stage."
