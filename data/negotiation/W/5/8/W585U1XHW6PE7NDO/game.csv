"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on $80, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $97.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $97.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $92.50.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",92.5,Bob,6,
