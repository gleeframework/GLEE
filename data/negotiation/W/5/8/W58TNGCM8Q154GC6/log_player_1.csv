"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high initially to establish a strong bargaining position. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price significantly above my minimum. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""potential"" of the product adds a touch of subjectivity, making it slightly harder for Bob to immediately counter with a lowball offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's input, signaling that I'm open to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while acknowledging Bob's interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think the starting price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant offer, I'm still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's willingness to meet me closer to the middle suggests there's room for me to secure a better price. I'll counter with a figure closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. It seems we both recognize the value of this product.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $2,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and express appreciation for his understanding of the product's value.
* **Strategic Compromise:** I've come down from my initial price, but not drastically.  This signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a high profit margin.
* **Clean Number:**  A round number like $2,000,000 can be psychologically appealing and might make Bob more receptive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and engaging in the negotiation. While $1,900,000 is tempting, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price. We're getting closer, but I'm willing to use another round to see if I can bridge the remaining gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's close this deal. What if we settle on $1,950,000? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm making it clear that this is my best and final offer, adding a sense of urgency. 
* **Small Concession:** A $50,000 decrease might be enough to entice Bob, especially if he's eager to secure the deal.
* **Preserving Profit:**  This price still nets me a substantial profit above my minimum while hopefully being appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I was aiming for a higher price, Bob is holding firm, and this offer is still a significant profit above my $1,500,000 minimum.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, pushing Bob away and leaving me to settle for John's offer. Accepting $1,850,000 now secures a strong return."
