"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $150, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it. This gives me room to negotiate down while still getting a profit.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $120, I'm willing to be more aggressive in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I won't sell it for that. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $130.  I'm still aiming for a profit, but recognizing that Bob is unlikely to accept my initial offer. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and counter again.  I'm willing to take some risk with Bob as I know I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $110.  I'm getting closer to Bob's valuation, but I'm still confident that I can get a higher price than his initial offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that will be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've gone through a few rounds, and while I'm getting closer to Bob's valuation, I'm not confident I can close the deal with him at a price that meets my minimum.  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is high.  To secure a guaranteed profit, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
