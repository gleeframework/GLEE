"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This price not only ensures a fair deal for both of us but also allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I understand this might be higher than what you were expecting, but considering the quality and benefits it offers, I believe it's a fair offer. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's no need to spend the extra $2,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John and maximize your savings."
