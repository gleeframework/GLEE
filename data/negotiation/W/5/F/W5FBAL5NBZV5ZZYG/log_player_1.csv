Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation but still allows for some potential negotiation.  By starting high, I can potentially secure a price closer to my ideal goal.  However, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't accept a reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, so it makes sense to accept.  This way I don't risk losing a sale to John and getting only $80, and I also don't risk further negotiation that might lead to a lower offer from Bob."
