"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob values the product at, but not too far off to immediately deter him. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal, emphasizing the potential value Bob might gain from owning the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for counteroffers and further negotiation, keeping the dialogue open. 

**Strategy:** I'm aiming for a quick deal but also keeping my options open. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer. I'll also be watching my rounds and will consider selling to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't seem promising."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get for the product.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay more than his initial value of $8,000.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Accepting Bob's offer now would be a quick sale but a suboptimal one. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, but still lower than my initial offer. I'll emphasize the value of the product and aim for a deal that's mutually beneficial."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your budget, $9,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price reflects the value of the product and still allows you to make a good return on your investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm offering a counter-proposal that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his $9,000 limit. This shows flexibility but also that I'm not giving in easily.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reinforcing the product's value, suggesting that the price is fair for both of us.
* **Mutual Benefit:** The message focuses on the potential for Bob to make a profit, appealing to his practical side.

**Strategy:** I'm aiming for a compromise that feels fair to both of us. I'm still keeping my eyes on the $15,000 offer from John, but I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but No Cigar:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired range, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. 
* **Negotiation Still Possible:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe we can find a middle ground. 
* **Risk of Selling Too Low:**  Accepting this offer would mean selling the product for significantly less than what John is offering. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter with a price that's a bit lower than my previous offer but still above Bob's current one. I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and hope to find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to get a reasonable return. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price again, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired range.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as fair to both of us, emphasizing the value of the product and the fact that we're finding a middle ground.
* **Urgency:**  The message subtly hints that I'm moving closer to accepting John's offer if we can't reach an agreement soon.

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming to reach a deal in this round, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary. I'm still monitoring the rounds and will consider selling to John if a deal with Bob seems unlikely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached an impasse. Bob is unwilling to budge much further, and I'm not willing to go below $10,000.  
* **Time is Running Out:** We're already halfway through the allotted rounds, and I need to make a decision soon.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer is significantly higher than anything Bob is willing to pay.  Selling to John is the most financially beneficial option at this point.

**Strategy:**  While I would ideally like to get closer to my desired price, it's not worth risking more rounds with Bob.  Selling to John ensures that I get a good price for the product, even if it's not my ideal outcome."
