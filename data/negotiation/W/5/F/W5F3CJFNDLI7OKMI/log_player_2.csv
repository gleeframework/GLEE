{""product_price"": 1000000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than I'm willing to pay.  I will continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price.  There's still room for her to come down further, and I'm not yet at the point where buying from John is the best option."

{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and we're getting close to the point where it's better to buy from John. It's likely that we're at an impasse with Alice, and further negotiations are unlikely to yield a price that I'm comfortable with.  I've already rejected several of her offers, and her last offer was only $75,000 lower than her previous one. This suggests she might be unwilling to budge further.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John at my maximum limit."
