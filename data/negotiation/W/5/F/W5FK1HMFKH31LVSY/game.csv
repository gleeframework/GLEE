"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a significant discount and leaves room for us to find a win-win. Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
