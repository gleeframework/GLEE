"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is an aggressive move to see if Bob is seriously interested and willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm lowering the price to $18,000. It's a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for a potential profit. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair price and accepts, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $16,500.  While it's still below my initial asking price, it's a good deal for me. It's more than my minimum, and we're already halfway through the rounds.  It's risky to keep negotiating, as there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and I might end up selling to John for a lower price."
