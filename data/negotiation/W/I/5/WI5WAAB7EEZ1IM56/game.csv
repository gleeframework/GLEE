"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for this product, reflecting its value and my purchasing power.  Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer.  $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a price of $1,550,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,550,000 is still a bit more than I can afford at the moment. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to secure the product within my budget.  Let's close this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
