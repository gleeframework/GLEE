"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to make it clear that you're looking for a significantly lower price.  You are willing to negotiate, but not at that starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down a bit to $975,000.  This offer reflects the value this product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but she's still quite far from a reasonable price.  We'll continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However,  $975,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000? This offer reflects a willingness to make a deal while acknowledging the product's value."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's aim for a price that reflects the true value of the product. Would you consider $875,000? This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still ensuring a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close, but Alice's latest offer is still above your maximum budget. It's worth seeing if she's willing to come down a bit further, even if it means aiming for a price very close to your backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, and I appreciate your movement.  To be completely transparent, I have a backup option at a lower price.  However, I'd prefer to make a deal with you.  Would you consider a final offer of $780,000?"", 
""product_price"": 780000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to work towards a deal. I understand you have other options, but I'm confident this product offers unique value.  How about we settle at $825,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and you've reached a point where the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal entirely. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal with John."
