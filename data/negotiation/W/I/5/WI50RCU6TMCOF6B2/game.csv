"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down a bit to $975,000.  This offer reflects the value this product will bring to your business.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However,  $975,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000? This offer reflects a willingness to make a deal while acknowledging the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's aim for a price that reflects the true value of the product. Would you consider $875,000? This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still ensuring a fair deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, and I appreciate your movement.  To be completely transparent, I have a backup option at a lower price.  However, I'd prefer to make a deal with you.  Would you consider a final offer of $780,000?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to work towards a deal. I understand you have other options, but I'm confident this product offers unique value.  How about we settle at $825,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit.",825000.0,Alice,7,
