"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get it lower. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a great starting point. I'm interested, but I'm only able to go up to $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a Significant Counteroffer:**  Bob's goal is to save as much as possible. Starting with a $1000 reduction from Alice's price shows serious intent to negotiate.
* **Show Flexibility:**  The message emphasizes that Bob is interested but needs to be within a certain budget. This opens the door to further negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Compromise:**  Offering $9,000 instead of, say, $8,000 allows for room for a middle ground if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down to $9500. This is a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and $9,500 is a price within Bob's budget. 
* **Saving Money:**  Accepting the offer means saving $500 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a chance of negotiating an even lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy at John's higher price isn't worth it for a potential $500 saving."
