"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting high at $10,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. However, it's important to be realistic and keep in mind my minimum acceptable price of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a great starting point. I'm interested, but I'm only able to go up to $9000 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob before selling to John, so I'm willing to take a chance."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down to $9500. This is a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
