"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is unfortunately too low for me. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1025000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while being within a reasonable range for you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1025000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $975000? I think that's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product without breaking the bank.",975000.0,Bob,4,
