"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth more to you than that. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and compromise on the price. How about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
