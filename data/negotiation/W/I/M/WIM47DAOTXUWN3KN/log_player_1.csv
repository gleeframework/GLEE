{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $80, but below my minimum acceptable price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation, and hopefully, we can find a price that works for both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I can always sell to John for $150, so there's no risk in offering a slightly lower price first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a happy medium. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
This counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but closer to my desired value. I believe this offer is a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will accept it.  If not, I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll choose to sell to John for $150, as that guarantees my minimum desired profit."
