Considering its exceptional benefits, I am offering it to you for $120. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the value we place on customer satisfaction. Would you like to consider this offer?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? I'm willing to pay a premium for a quality product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
