"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, the market value of this product is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. You can aim for a lower price, and if she doesn't meet your counteroffer, you can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While the product is certainly valuable, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it brings to the table, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?

``` 
You should accept Alice's offer.  $1,100,000 is a good price, and while you could try to negotiate further, it's likely she won't budge.  It's better to secure the product at this price than to risk going to John and paying the full $1,500,000."
