"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, the market value of this product is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While the product is certainly valuable, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it brings to the table, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
