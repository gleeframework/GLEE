"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850000 is still quite a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to $950000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's keep talking.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a price that's fair for you, but $950000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It represents a compromise from both our sides, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a little too low for me.  Considering the unique value of this product, I'm prepared to come down to $975000. It's a fair price that reflects both our needs. I'm confident this is the best deal we can reach.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm going to offer $925000, which is a significant step towards meeting your needs. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.  I understand the value of your product, but I also need to stick to my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This is my final offer. I believe it reflects the true value of the product, and it's the best we can do to close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,7,
