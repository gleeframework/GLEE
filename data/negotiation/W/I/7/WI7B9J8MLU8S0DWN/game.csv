"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm keen on the product but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $650,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's still a bit below my target. Considering your enthusiasm, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable asset.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not quite there. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make a small concession.
