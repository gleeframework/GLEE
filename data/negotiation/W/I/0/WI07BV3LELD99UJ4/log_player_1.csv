"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with a strong initial offer. This anchors the negotiation higher, even if the number is significantly above both your valuation and Bob's.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $2,000,000, we have ample space to negotiate downwards over the remaining rounds while still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum. 
* **Gauge Bob's Reaction:**  This first offer will help us understand Bob's perception of the product's value and his willingness to negotiate. His response will guide our strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both our valuation and our starting point. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  We know John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, so we have leverage to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down a bit, but need to see some movement on your end. Would you consider $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Measured Drop:** We want to demonstrate flexibility but not appear desperate. A drop of $250,000 shows willingness to negotiate but keeps us well above both Bob's offer and our minimum.
* **Shifting the Anchor:**  By countering with $1,750,000, we aim to pull the negotiation closer to our desired range. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help us assess Bob's seriousness and potential to reach a mutually beneficial deal. His reaction will be key in determining our next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could potentially do $1,250,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Bob has increased his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still below our guaranteed offer from John. We have room to negotiate further and will aim to draw Bob closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable price.  To meet you halfway, I could consider $1,625,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1625000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** We're proposing a price that's exactly halfway between our previous offer ($1,750,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,500,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong position.
* **Highlighting Value:** We reiterate the product's value to subtly remind Bob of its worth and justify the price point.
* **Encouraging a Decision:** By framing this as a significant concession, we hope to encourage Bob to seriously consider the offer and potentially move closer to closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm getting closer to my limit, but $1,625,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to settle at $1,350,000? That's a fair compromise, in my opinion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting very close! Bob is clearly engaged and willing to negotiate. However, his offer of $1,350,000 is still below John's guaranteed $1,500,000. We'll make one more strategic counteroffer in an attempt to secure a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, we're nearly there! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,450,000?  This reflects a fair compromise for both of us and allows us to close this deal. "",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push for a Favorable Deal:**  This offer is strategically positioned just above John's offer, maximizing our potential profit while still holding a slight edge over the guaranteed sale.
* **Sense of Urgency and Compromise:**  By ""splitting the difference,"" we convey a final attempt at compromise and create a sense of urgency for Bob to accept. 
* **Prepare for Alternatives:** While this is our ideal scenario, we are mentally prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob rejects this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, we're definitely close!  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000.  That's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Outcome:**  Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a solid win. It exceeds John's offer by $100,000, maximizing our profit in this scenario.
* **Time Value & Risk:**  While we could push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk Bob might decrease his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome and avoids potential losses.
* **Successful Negotiation:** We've managed to negotiate a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy."
