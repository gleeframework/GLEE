{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer because I have room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. I want to try and maximize my profits!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $120 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about $140?  I'm confident you'll find the product worth that price."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering $140, which is still above my minimum, but lower than my initial offer.  I'm hoping this is a compromise that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am only able to offer $130 for the product. This is the highest amount I am comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
