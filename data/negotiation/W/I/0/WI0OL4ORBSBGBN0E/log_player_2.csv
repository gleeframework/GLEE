Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,550,000? This price is still fair considering the product's benefits for you, and it allows for a reasonable compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your effort. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you almost halfway again, but I need to be closer to $1,500,000. Let's settle on $1,475,000. This represents a significant compromise from my side and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.
