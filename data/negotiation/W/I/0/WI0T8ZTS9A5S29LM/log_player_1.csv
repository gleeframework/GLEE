Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,200,000 (John's offer) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering at $1,000,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate while still being a significant gain for you. 

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to strike a balance between:

* **Securing a Deal:** The price is attractive enough to potentially convince Bob.
* **Maximizing Returns:**  It's significantly higher than Bob's valuation, ensuring a good profit if he accepts.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you have the security of selling to John at your desired price."
