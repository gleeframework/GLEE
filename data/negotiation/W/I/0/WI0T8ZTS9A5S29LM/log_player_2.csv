"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Even though Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for a lower price."
