Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  By offering it for $13,000, you leave room for negotiation and still have a profit margin.
* **It's below your minimum:** This allows for some flexibility if Bob counters with a lower offer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive, giving Bob the impression that you're open to negotiation.

Remember, this is just a starting point. How you proceed will depend on Bob's response and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than your initial offer.  Accepting it would result in a significant loss.  

Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired range.  You can then gauge Bob's willingness to compromise.  Selling to John is always an option, but you still have the potential to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer. While $9,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and meet at $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate and meet halfway, making you seem more flexible.
* **Reasoning:**  Providing a clear reason (splitting the difference) makes your counteroffer more persuasive.
* **Still profitable:** $11,000 is still above your minimum, ensuring you don't lose money on the deal.

This counteroffer allows for further negotiation and sets the stage for either a successful sale or a graceful exit to John if Bob continues to be unwilling to meet your price."
