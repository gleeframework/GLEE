"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price ($13,000) and my maximum budget ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is courteous but clearly indicates the initial price isn't acceptable. 
* **Aiming for a Deal:** While I have the option to go with John at $10,000, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower to make a sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer. While $9,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and meet at $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice met me in the middle. $11,000 is a reasonable price, saving me $2,000 off her initial offer and only $1,000 more than John's price.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result, and there's always the risk Alice might walk away.  
* **Saving Money:**  The most important factor is getting a good deal, and $11,000 is a significant savings compared to her starting price."
