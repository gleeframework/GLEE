Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I'm still a bit above $14,000. I'll meet you at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. If you're interested, we can finalize the deal at this price.

While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll go below her $15,000 valuation. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, which is better than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
