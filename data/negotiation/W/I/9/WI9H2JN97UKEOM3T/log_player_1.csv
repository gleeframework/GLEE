Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""value and potential"" creates a perceived higher worth.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is ambitious, it leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower the initial offer.
* **Market Context:** Understanding if there are similar products in the market and their pricing can inform your strategy."
