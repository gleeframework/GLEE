"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is outside my budget.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit while ensuring you receive a good return on your investment.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,650,000 is closer, it's still above my maximum budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,425,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1425000.0,Bob,4,
