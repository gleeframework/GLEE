"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",170.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to come down to $120? That's my maximum budget, but I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $120 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $145. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. Let me know if this works for you!",145.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the compromise. I appreciate you coming down to $145, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget. Would you consider $135?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you.",135.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $135 just yet. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $142. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you!",142.0,Alice,5,
