"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $170 is above your maximum budget of $120.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to come down to $120? That's my maximum budget, but I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $120 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $145. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price of $120. You have a better option with John, so it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before committing."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the compromise. I appreciate you coming down to $145, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget. Would you consider $135?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $135 just yet. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $142. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $142 is closer to your budget than Alice's previous offers, it's still higher than your ideal price.  Since John is offering the product for your maximum budget of $120, it's the most financially sensible option at this point.  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity to buy from John at a better price."
