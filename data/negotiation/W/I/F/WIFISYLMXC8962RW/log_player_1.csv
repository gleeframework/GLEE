Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price, $120. This way, I maximize my potential earnings. If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $120, so I will reject his offer. I'll see if I can get a better counteroffer from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter with $115.  This is still above Bob's value of $100 but lower than my original asking price. It's a compromise that might be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm willing to sell for. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm going to counter with $112. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my target price. Hopefully, this will be a more attractive offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm getting tired of this back-and-forth. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120 to ensure I get the best price."
