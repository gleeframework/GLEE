{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this to be a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but it provides room for negotiation and makes the offer appear more attractive.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  Framing the offer as exclusive adds a sense of urgency and value.
* **Focus on ROI:** Highlighting the potential return on investment appeals to Bob's desire to make a profitable purchase. 

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, Alice increases the chance of securing a deal with Bob above her minimum acceptable price."
