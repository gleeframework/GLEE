Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $11,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can then potentially settle on a price between $11,000 and $12,000.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency can encourage a quicker decision from Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or willingness to pay more than $8,000. 
* If we had more information about Bob, we might adjust our strategy accordingly."
