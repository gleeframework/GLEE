You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,000,000 is far above his budget. He can try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets the stage for negotiation and shows Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is still above his budget. He should continue negotiating with Alice and see if he can get a lower price.  Buying from John is still an option, but it might be beneficial to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing Alice he's willing to compromise but still trying to stay within his budget. This is a strategic move to gauge Alice's willingness to meet halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $850,000 is still above his budget, and he's only got a few rounds left. While buying from John is always an option, he should try to see if he can get a lower price from Alice. There's a good chance Alice will come down further as she's already made concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob is now offering Alice's bottom price of $800,000. This is a risky move, but with only 4 rounds left, he needs to push for a deal. It's possible Alice might accept, or at least come down a little further, making it worthwhile to buy from her."
