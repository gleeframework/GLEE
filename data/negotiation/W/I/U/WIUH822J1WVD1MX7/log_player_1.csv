"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable offering $11,500.  It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher than his $11,500 offer. Accepting would mean losing $500 compared to John's guaranteed offer. While there's a chance of squeezing a bit more from Bob, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point."
