"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Starting high allows room for negotiation. While the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, aiming for $2,000,000 leaves space to potentially secure a price above my minimum. It also gauges Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open, and I can try to steer him closer to a more acceptable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. Let's meet closer to the middle ground.  How about $1,750,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've reduced my price, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to make a deal. 
* **Anchoring:** By keeping the price relatively high, I'm still trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my initial offer, aiming to secure a price above my minimum.
* **Justification:** The phrase ""true value"" subtly reinforces the idea that his initial valuation might be undervaluing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $1,400,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk he'll walk away or the negotiation could stall. Accepting secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
