"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9500 is a fair price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it at that price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $10800. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating, but $10800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
