Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for you to make concessions if needed, and still profit. 

Remember, it's important to be confident but flexible in your negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to close the deal, it's important to hold firm to my minimum value. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can offer $950,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I need to hold firm and try to get a better price.  I'll make one last counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  If you're serious about this, I'm open to finalizing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I can offer $980,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm not sure if there's any more room for negotiation. I'm getting a better price with John, so it's best to end the negotiation with Bob and move forward with John."
