"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great value. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,5,
