"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What are your thoughts?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $22,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but my maximum offer is $8,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway? I can let it go for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a fair price.  However, $10,000 is still less than I'm looking for.  I'm willing to accept $13,000, which is a compromise on my end.  This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
