Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15,000. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to consider $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. $12,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum, and I have several rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $13000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $13,000 is a good deal considering we're already in round 4. It's above my minimum and a decent compromise.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
