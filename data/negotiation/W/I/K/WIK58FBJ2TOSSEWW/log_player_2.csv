"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15000. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000, there's room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've started with a significant counteroffer to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is a decent drop from $15,000, but still within my budget. This gives Alice room to counter without feeling like they're giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $12000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to my target, I still have some room to negotiate. Alice is clearly willing to come down, so I'll counter again and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've increased my offer slightly, showing that I'm serious about buying the product.  $13,000 is a fair compromise and leaves room for Alice to accept or make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price."
