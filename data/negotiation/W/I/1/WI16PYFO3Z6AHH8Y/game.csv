"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a significant discount from my original price, and it reflects my desire to reach a deal with you.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
