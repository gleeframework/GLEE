"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further,  how about $1,250,000? This would still give you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000.  Would that be agreeable to you?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  However,  $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm confident this product will bring you significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
