Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. It's a great compromise considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product for $10,200. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,200.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save the extra $200."
