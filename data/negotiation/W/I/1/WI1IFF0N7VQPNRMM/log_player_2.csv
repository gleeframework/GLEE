"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's starting price is too high.  There's plenty of room for negotiation before approaching John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $5,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

This offer is a starting point to see how flexible Alice is willing to be.  It's a significant jump down from her offer, but still keeps the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a point where it makes sense to accept over John's offer. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $7,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:**  We're not just sticking to a low number. 
* **Finds a middle ground:**  The average of the last two offers makes it seem reasonable.
* **Stays below John's price:** There's still room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still not quite there.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again. Would you consider $8,500? This would allow us to both reach a fair agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth haggling over the difference when John is offering a guaranteed price at our target.  It's time to take John's offer."
