"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 is considerably below its worth.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see some more movement on your end as well. Would you consider $1,210,000?",1210000.0,Alice,5,
