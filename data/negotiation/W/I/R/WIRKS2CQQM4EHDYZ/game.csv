"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while I secure a good return on my investment.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount, and it's the best I can do. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,050,000. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
