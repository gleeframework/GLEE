"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to me is at least $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering it for that price. There's no immediate benefit to accepting her offer. You should reject it and consider other options, potentially negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
