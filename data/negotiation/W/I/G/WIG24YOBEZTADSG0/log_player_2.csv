Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to push the price higher. While she's saying it's her final offer, we're not out of rounds yet and still have negotiating power. Let's see if we can push her down a bit further before considering accepting a price above $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're tough!  I respect that.  But I need to be realistic about my budget. $11,000 is my absolute limit.  If you can do that, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, we're getting close to Alice's likely minimum.  Offering $11,000 is a firm but fair counter. It signals that we're serious but won't be pushed beyond our limit. This leaves Alice with a decision to make, and it keeps us below the John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I think it's a stretch for me to go any lower. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is holding firm at a price that's not acceptable. She's stated multiple times that it's her ""final offer,"" even though we're not at the final round. She's gone back on her word before, and it's likely she'll do it again if we counter. It's clear she's not budging much further. 

At this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. We've gotten her down to $11,500, but that's still a significant amount more than her known value for the product ($8,000).  John's price of $15,000, while higher, is a guaranteed way to acquire the product and avoid the risk of walking away with nothing if the negotiation with Alice completely stalls."
