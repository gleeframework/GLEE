"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To start negotiations, I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  This is a substantial starting point, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both understand the product holds.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $825,000? This reflects my desire to close the deal while ensuring a fair price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than my comfortable range.  To finalize the deal, I'm offering $800,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product given our discussions.  Let's make this happen!",800000.0,Bob,6,
