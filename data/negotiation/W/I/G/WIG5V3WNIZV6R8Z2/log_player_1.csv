"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To start negotiations, I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  This is a substantial starting point, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both understand the product holds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a better price than $750,000. It's worth risking another round of negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $825,000? This reflects my desire to close the deal while ensuring a fair price."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than my comfortable range.  To finalize the deal, I'm offering $800,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product given our discussions.  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

This is the best possible outcome at this point. Bob has reached our minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer."
