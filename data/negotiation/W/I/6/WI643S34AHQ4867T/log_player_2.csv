"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10500 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my original asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $11250?  That would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,250 is closer to his budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his maximum. He can try to negotiate a lower price again or buy from John, who is offering a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,250 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Would you be open to $10,750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your effort to find a price we can both agree on.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10750 is still a little too low for me.  How about $11000?  That's a reasonable compromise, and it would allow me to finalize the sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached his limit.  While $11,000 is closer to his budget than Alice's previous offers, it's still above his maximum of $10,000.  It's clear that Alice isn't willing to go any lower, so Bob is better off buying from John, who is offering the product for his maximum budget."
