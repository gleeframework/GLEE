{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while still getting a significant profit for you. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly tone can encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Flexibility:**  The message emphasizes that you are open to finding a price that works for both of you, which can make Bob feel like he has more control in the negotiation. 

This initial offer gives you a good starting point while leaving space to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10500? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:**  While it's closer to your desired price, it's still below the $15,000 minimum you've set for yourself.
* **Negotiation potential:**  You can potentially increase the price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You know you have John as a backup buyer at $15,000, so you can afford to be firm in your negotiations with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're willing to negotiate but not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below your minimum.  This keeps the negotiation alive and gives you a chance to improve your position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my original asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  You're  rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $11,250 is exactly halfway between your original offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500, making it a logical compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** You emphasize a ""good compromise"" to keep the conversation amicable.

This counteroffer demonstrates that you're serious about selling the product to Bob but won't accept a price that's too low. It also signals flexibility, which can encourage him to consider your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11250 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Would you be open to $10750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Even though Bob has moved closer to your asking price, his offer is still below your minimum of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:** You've shown flexibility by negotiating, and you've established a range that Bob is willing to work within. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000, allowing you to be more cautious with Bob's offer.

Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive, giving you another chance to raise the price.  You can either make a counteroffer to Bob or, if the next offer isn't satisfactory, you can safely accept John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your effort to find a price we can both agree on.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,750 is still a little too low for me.  How about $11,000?  That's a reasonable compromise, and it would allow me to finalize the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** You're showing a willingness to move closer to Bob's offer but not giving up on a decent profit. 
* **Small Adjustment:** The counteroffer of $11,000 is a smaller step down from your previous offer, making it feel more reasonable.
* **Finality:** You're including a message emphasizing that $11,000 is a reasonable compromise and that you're ready to finalize the sale, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while increasing the potential for a successful sale, given Bob's recent willingness to compromise."
