"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a high price. If he rejects, I can always lower my price in subsequent rounds, but starting high gives me more room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $900,000. This is a compromise that's closer to his offer, but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and entice him to accept."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
