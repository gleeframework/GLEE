Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters.
* **It's below my minimum valuation:** This ensures I'm still making a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This sets the tone for a professional negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is close to my minimum valuation, I've already spent a few rounds negotiating with Bob.  It's not worth the time and effort to continue negotiating. John is offering me my minimum price, so I'll take the guaranteed $120 and sell to him."
