"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $80 for the product. Would that be acceptable?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is worth a lot more than that.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $115?  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. While $115 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to commit to that price. I would like to propose $95 as my maximum offer. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget.  $95 is a step closer, but it's still not quite enough for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $105?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  If you're still not comfortable, I might need to move on to another buyer.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I've carefully considered your offers, and I believe $100 is the most I can realistically offer at this time. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",100.0,Bob,6,
