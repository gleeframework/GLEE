"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $1,500,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair, considering its value to me and the savings it represents for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's intrinsic worth and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This adjustment reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is within your budget of $1,500,000 and is a better deal than buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice could walk away or make a counteroffer that's closer to your initial budget. It's better to lock in this price to secure the product."
