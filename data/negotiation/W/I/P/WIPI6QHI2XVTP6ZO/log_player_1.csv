Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a much higher profit.
* **Confident Language:** Using phrases like ""significant value"" and ""unique opportunity"" aims to increase the perceived value of the product in Bob's mind.
* **No Justification:** I'm not providing a reason for the price. This avoids potentially anchoring the negotiation around a lower value. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm prepared to negotiate down. However, I have a strong alternative with John at $10,000, so I won't go below that price."
