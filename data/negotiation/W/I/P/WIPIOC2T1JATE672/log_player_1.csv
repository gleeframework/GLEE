Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it highly, I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $120 offer leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Above Minimum:** This price ensures that even if Bob negotiates down, we remain well above our minimum acceptable price of $80.

By aiming high initially, we increase the chances of securing a deal that's highly profitable, while still having the safety net of John's offer."
