"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think.

It's not a good deal for Bob at $12,000. He should reject and counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a good value for the product, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Bob can still do better. $11,000 is still above his target price. He should counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
