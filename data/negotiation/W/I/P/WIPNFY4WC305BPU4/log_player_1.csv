Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding that you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum acceptable price. This gives you leverage with Bob.  You want to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's below his perceived value of $1,200,000) but high enough to maximize your potential profit.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob. Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency.
* **Product Price:** $1,150,000 is strategically placed:
    *  **Below Bob's Value:**  It's lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), making it appealing.
    * **Above Your Minimum:** It's significantly higher than your guaranteed price from John ($1,500,000), maximizing your potential profit.

**Outcome:**

This offer gives you the best chance to sell at the highest possible price to Bob. If he accepts, you make a great profit. If he rejects, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer."
