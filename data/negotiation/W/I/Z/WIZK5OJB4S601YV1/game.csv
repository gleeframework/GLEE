"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has great potential. However, I believe  $800,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $700,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $700,000 is closer, I think we still have some ground to cover.  Would you be open to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $675,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
