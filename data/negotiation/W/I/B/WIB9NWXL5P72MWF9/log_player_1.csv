"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
