Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm offering the product at $1,200,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it gives him room to negotiate and still get a good deal.
* **Message:** I'm being polite and direct, explaining the reasoning behind the price. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize my potential earnings:** By starting high, I aim to capture as much of the potential profit as possible.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I've given Bob space to counteroffer, making it more likely he'll engage in the negotiation process.
* **Secure a backup option:** I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net if Bob doesn't accept my terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $950,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. 
* **John offers a better deal:** I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making Bob's offer less attractive.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe I can still secure a better price through further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I will counteroffer with a price that's higher than $950,000 but lower than my initial offer.  The goal is to find a price that is agreeable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  Given the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:**  I'm aiming for a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer. This signals a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Message:** I'm being polite and expressing understanding while reiterating the value of the product to Bob. This helps to keep the negotiation positive and encourages him to consider my offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering $1,100,000, I'm giving Bob a chance to counteroffer again if he's still not satisfied. This keeps the negotiation process open and allows for a potential agreement. 

**Outcome:**

My goal is to secure a price that's above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  If Bob accepts this counteroffer, I'll achieve that goal. If he rejects it, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered it carefully, and while I appreciate the reduction, I'm still not able to meet at that price. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this helps move us closer to a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While I could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Bob might reject again and I might end up selling to John for less.
* **Potential for further compromise:** If Bob is willing to pay $1,050,000, there's a chance that he might be willing to go a little higher if I push for it. However, this is not guaranteed.

**Conclusion:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale that meets my minimum price requirement. While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high. It's a good compromise that allows me to maximize my earnings while minimizing potential losses."
