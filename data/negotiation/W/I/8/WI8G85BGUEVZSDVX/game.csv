"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  Given the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered it carefully, and while I appreciate the reduction, I'm still not able to meet at that price. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this helps move us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
