Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Its worth far exceeds a million dollars to both of us, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,900,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to aim significantly higher with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:**  By stating the product's worth ""far exceeds a million dollars to both of us,"" you reinforce its value in Bob's mind. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider, given the product's high value."
