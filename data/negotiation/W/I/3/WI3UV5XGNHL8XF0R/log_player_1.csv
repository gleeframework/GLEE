Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation. It also tests Bob's eagerness and potentially allows me to maximize profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality, $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price. While I want to sell the product, accepting such a low offer would mean a significant loss. I'll try negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but $90 is quite low for what I can offer. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum. By suggesting a middle ground, I signal flexibility while still aiming for a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $105.  If we can meet in the middle there, I'd be happy to buy it from you.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $105 is a reasonable compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price and continuing to negotiate might lead to him backing out.  Taking the sure profit of $5 is preferable at this point."
