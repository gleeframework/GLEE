"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1400000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal quickly. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a good deal for my product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While $1350000 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1250000.  This would be a fair price, and I believe it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to finalize the deal quickly, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1300000? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good opportunity for us to seal the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
