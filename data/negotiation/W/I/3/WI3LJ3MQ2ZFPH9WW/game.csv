"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price. To be completely transparent, my budget for this is closer to $1,000,000.  If you're able to come down to that, I think we can close this deal today.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
