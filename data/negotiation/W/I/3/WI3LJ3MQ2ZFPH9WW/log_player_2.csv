Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is well within Bob's budget. Accepting now avoids the risk of the deal falling through altogether."
