``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $1,350,000 is less than $1,500,000.
* **You can do better:**  You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice. This means there's room to negotiate for a lower price. 
* **Rejecting the offer keeps options open:** By rejecting, you can counter-offer or see if Alice will lower her price."
