"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while still getting the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,000, which is above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. 
* **John's price:** $12,000, which is Bob's limit.

Since Alice's offer is already too high, Bob should reject it and try to negotiate a better price. There are 9 rounds remaining, giving Bob room to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while securing the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,000, which is too high.
* **John's price:** $12,000, Bob's absolute maximum.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer to gauge her willingness to negotiate.  

This counteroffer of $10,500 is a substantial drop from Alice's price and is closer to Alice's perceived value of $10,000. This aggressive move puts pressure on Alice and gives Bob a strong starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,500, which is still above Bob's limit.
* **John's price:** $12,000, which is Bob's maximum.

Alice has moved closer to Bob's preferred price, but her offer is still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as there are still 7 rounds left.  Rejection allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while still securing the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,500, which is still too high. 
* **John's price:** $12,000, which is Bob's limit.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Gradually increase the offer, showing willingness to negotiate while staying below Bob's maximum.

This counteroffer increases Bob's previous offer by $250, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price below Alice's last offer and below Bob's maximum. This incremental approach could encourage Alice to move closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

* **Alice's offer:** $11,750, which is still too high.
* **John's price:** $12,000, which is Bob's maximum.

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, but it's still above his target. With 5 rounds left, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially bring the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while still securing the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,750, which is still above Bob's limit but closer to his target. 
* **John's price:** $12,000, which is Bob's maximum.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Increase the offer incrementally while keeping it below Bob's limit.

This counteroffer of $11,000 is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while staying below Alice's last offer. It also demonstrates Bob's intention to stay below his maximum price point. With only 4 rounds remaining, this move puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while still securing the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,900, which is very close to Bob's limit but still above it.
* **John's price:** $12,000, which is Bob's maximum.

There are only 3 rounds left.  Alice has shown a pattern of being unwilling to come down significantly in price.  While there's a chance Alice might accept a counteroffer in the next round, it's risky to continue negotiating with her.  Buying from John guarantees Bob gets the product and saves potentially more money than if Alice accepts a counteroffer in the next round."
