"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $17500?",17500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $17500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $20000 and $17500. I'm offering the product to you for $18750. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",18750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $18000, but that's the maximum I can afford. Would you be willing to accept that price?",18000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $18000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $19000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $19000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $18500, but that's the absolute maximum I can afford. Would you be willing to accept that price?",18500.0,Bob,6,
