"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've personally valued at no less than $15000, and I know it would be worth that much to you as well. I'm willing to offer it to you for $16000.  This is a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts!",16000.0,Alice,1,
