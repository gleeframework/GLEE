"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. Since I can buy the product from John for $120, which is more than Alice's offer of $110, I can save $10 by buying from John.
