Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below her minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a slightly lower price.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays of finding another buyer, even if John is guaranteed at $12,000."
