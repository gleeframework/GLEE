Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the value you've stated, and it's closer to what this product is worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.

While $1,400,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable spending. It's worth trying to negotiate further. I'll try to push for a lower price again."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,450,000?  This price reflects the value the product holds for both of us.  I believe it's a fair deal that we can both be happy with.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above my budget. While there's a chance she could lower the price further, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk not being able to secure the product at all. It's better to be safe and go with John's offer of $1,000,000, which is within my budget."
