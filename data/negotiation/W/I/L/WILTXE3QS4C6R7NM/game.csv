"Hello Alice, I appreciate the value you see in the product and understand its significance. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose an offer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us,  $950,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirement.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer still represents a significant value for you while allowing me to achieve my desired outcome.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
