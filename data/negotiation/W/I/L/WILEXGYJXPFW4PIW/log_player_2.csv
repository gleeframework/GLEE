"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. I'm not at liberty to disclose all the details at this point, but I can assure you it's worth at least $1.5 million to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high for Bob's budget.  It's better to reject the offer and either negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
