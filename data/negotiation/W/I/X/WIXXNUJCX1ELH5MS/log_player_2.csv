"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $100 to you, I propose a price of $95 for this exceptional item. This offer allows you to acquire it at a slight premium over its intrinsic value, ensuring both parties are satisfied. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is a bit too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no need to pay $95. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially propose a lower price, closer to your desired range."
