"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,200,000.  There's room to negotiate with Alice, and Bob can potentially get a lower price.  Buying from John is a fallback option, but not the best choice at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob wants to save as much as possible.  Offering a price close to Alice's value of $1,000,000 shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable margin:** A $50,000 increase over Alice's value is a fair starting point. It's not too aggressive, but it shows Bob is serious about finding a deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This offer provides space for potential counteroffers and negotiations, allowing for a mutually agreeable price within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer:** While $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Room for compromise:** There's still room for negotiation. Bob can aim for a price closer to $1,100,000 or $1,150,000.
* **Avoid John:**  Buying from John is still the worst option, as $1,500,000 is significantly higher than what Bob could potentially secure with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between Alice's current offer ($1,300,000) and Bob's previous offer ($1,050,000).
* **Showing seriousness:** This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate in good faith, while still trying to achieve a favorable price.
* **Avoiding John:** This offer keeps Bob's potential savings significantly higher compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's price is too high:**  $1,400,000 is getting very close to Bob's maximum budget. Further negotiation might not yield significant savings, and there's a risk of the price going even higher.
* **John's price is acceptable:**  While John's price is the highest, it's within Bob's budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Alice. There's no guarantee Alice will accept a counteroffer, and the price could potentially go even higher.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing negotiations with Alice could drag out the process, and Bob might miss out on other potential opportunities.

Therefore, in this situation, buying from John offers a guaranteed outcome within Bob's budget and avoids the risk and potential time investment of further negotiations."
