"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price. Buying from John at this point would be the best option, but it's always worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down in price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my initial target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This price takes into account the value you've placed on the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob's budget. While it is a step closer to his ideal price, Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target.  He should also consider the potential time cost of continuing negotiations against the guaranteed price from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still outside my price range. I'm ready to pay $900,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This price is closer to my original target, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it is closer to his ideal price, it's not worth risking further negotiations. Bob can purchase the product from John for a guaranteed price of $800,000, saving him $250,000 compared to Alice's final offer.  The time and effort of continuing negotiations is not worth the potential savings."
