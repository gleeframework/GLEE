"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting high with an offer of $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's why this is a good starting point:

* **Sets a High Bar:**  It immediately establishes a strong baseline for the negotiation.
* **Creates Incentive:** Bob knows he has to counteroffer if he wants to make a deal.
* **Room to Compromise:**  I can still make concessions later without feeling like I'm giving away too much.

If Bob rejects, I'm ready to counter with a lower price, but I want to see if he's willing to play ball first.  Remember, I have the option to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000 at any point."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit. I'm going to reject this offer and counter in the next round.

Here's my reasoning:

* **Negotiation is Key:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000, and I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage. I don't have to rush into a deal that's significantly below my target. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Bob's willingness to counter shows he's interested. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.

I'm going to counter with a price that's slightly lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's latest offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is a $100,000 decrease from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 

Here's why this strategy is smart:

* **Staying Above My Minimum:** $1,100,000 is still above my minimum price of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't settle for a deal that's unprofitable.
* **Pressure on Bob:**  By reducing my offer slightly, I'm putting pressure on Bob to counter again.  
* **Signaling Flexibility:** This counteroffer shows Bob I'm serious about a deal but also willing to be reasonable.

If Bob rejects again, I'm prepared to further adjust my offer, but I'll keep my options open to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the profit margin.  I'm going to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

Here's my reasoning:

* **Pushing for a Better Price:**  I believe I can still get a higher price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000.
* **Leveraging My Position:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing him I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's last offer but still within a reasonable range, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests. 

I'm confident that with a well-crafted counteroffer, I can secure a deal that's closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $1,050,000. This is a $100,000 decrease from my previous offer, continuing to show a willingness to negotiate while staying above my minimum acceptable price.

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Closing the Gap:**  My counteroffer is now only $100,000 away from Bob's last offer, signaling that I'm getting closer to his price range.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my target. The fact that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me the leverage to not rush into a deal that's too low.
* **Testing Bob's Limits:** This counteroffer tests whether Bob is truly willing to pay closer to my desired price or if he'll stick to his lower offer.

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to decide if I'm willing to make another concession or if it's time to sell to John and move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. Here's why:

* **Almost There:**  I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can push for a deal closer to $1,000,000.
* **Leveraging John:**  Remember, I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,000,000. This gives me the confidence to continue negotiating without feeling pressured. 
* **Final Counteroffer:** I'll make one more counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price that's closer to my target.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to sell to John.

I believe a final counteroffer could get Bob to close the deal at a price that's more favorable to me."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final counteroffer to Bob. I'm offering the product for $1,000,000, my minimum acceptable price. 

Here's why this is a strategic move:

* **Final Stand:** This offer clearly shows Bob that I'm serious about getting as close to my desired price as possible. 
* **Equal Ground:** By offering $1,000,000, I'm essentially saying I'm willing to meet him halfway.  It's a reasonable compromise.
* **Decision Time:** Bob now has a clear choice: accept the offer and close the deal, or reject and risk losing the opportunity.  

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll immediately sell the product to John for $1,000,000. I'm not willing to go lower, as this is my minimum acceptable price."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $990,000 is very close to my minimum, I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000. 

Here's why:

* **Time is Running Out:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I want to ensure I secure a profitable deal. 
* **Minimal Gain:**  The $10,000 difference between Bob's offer and my minimum isn't significant enough to risk further negotiation.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money.

It's important to remember that I always had the option to sell to John, and this decision ultimately protects my financial interests and ensures a successful outcome."
