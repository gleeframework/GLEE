"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $125. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",137.5,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $137.5 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm happy to offer $130 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",130.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",135.0,Alice,5,,
