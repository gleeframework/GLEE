"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to go down a bit, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'd be willing to sell it to you for $9,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
