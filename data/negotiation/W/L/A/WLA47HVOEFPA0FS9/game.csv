,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,050,000. I really think this is a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you almost halfway at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while respecting your budget constraints. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is the price I mentioned earlier. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
