Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we want to maximize your profit.  Starting with a high offer allows room for negotiation or acceptance if Bob perceives a higher value.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 provides a safety net. This means we don't have to go below that price.
* **Negotiation Tactic:** The message implies scarcity and exclusivity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to:

* **Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to slightly lower your price if needed, but keep your minimum ($15,000) in mind.
* **Walk Away:** If Bob isn't willing to meet a price that's acceptable to you, you have the security of selling to John."
