"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, the product's value to me is considerably higher.  How about we settle at $1,500,000? This reflects a willingness to compromise while acknowledging the product's true worth.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1,400,000 is my absolute maximum. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
