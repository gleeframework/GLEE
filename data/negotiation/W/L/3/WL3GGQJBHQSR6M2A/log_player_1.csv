Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. While I have a guaranteed $120 from John, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm offering the product slightly below its value to Bob ($100) but above my minimum ($120). This aims to make the offer appealing while still generating a profit if he accepts. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is my initial offer, the message is open-ended, allowing for potential counter-offers from Bob if he's interested but wants to negotiate."
