{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me ($150) but leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $145? "", ""product_price"": 145} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd like to get.  I'll reject Bob's offer again and see if I can push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $140, which is a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I really want this product. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  At this point, it's not worth the effort to continue negotiating with Bob. I'll sell the product to John for $150 to ensure I get my minimum desired profit."
