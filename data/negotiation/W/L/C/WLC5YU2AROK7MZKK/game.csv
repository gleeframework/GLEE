"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you meet me in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I can do $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise again, so I can do $110. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll love it!",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I can do $70. It's the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement at that price.",70.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure we're going to meet in the middle on this one, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $100. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",100.0,Alice,7,
