"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a significant investment opportunity, and I believe the value it brings to your company will far exceed the price. Let's talk about how this can benefit you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000) and significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I'm not immediately giving away too much value. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message highlights the product's potential benefits to Bob's company, trying to shift his focus beyond just the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message doesn't make it a take-it-or-leave-it offer, leaving space for Bob to counter without feeling pressured.

**Strategy:**  By starting high and focusing on value, I aim to get Bob to see the potential of the product and negotiate from a higher starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I can only consider a price up to $800000 for the product. I understand its value might exceed this amount, but I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While $800,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting his offer would mean a substantial loss for me.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and continue negotiating. I believe there's still room for compromise, especially given that Bob acknowledges the product's potential value.
* **Selling to John is a Fallback:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, it's not the most profitable. I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Step:** I'll counter with a price lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's proposal, aiming for a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a very reasonable price considering the potential benefits you'll gain. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by dropping my price to $1,000,000, which is exactly my minimum acceptable price and  halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's value, reminding Bob that even at $1,000,000, it's still a good deal for him considering the potential returns. 
* **Direct Question:** The message ends with a direct question to encourage Bob to engage further and potentially accept the offer.

**Strategy:** I aim to present a reasonable middle ground while subtly reminding Bob of the product's value and urging him to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on our previous discussions and my financial capacity, I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer means only a small loss for me.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with a lower offer or having to sell to John at $1,000,000 increases.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Bob has shown willingness to negotiate and compromise. Accepting his offer avoids further rounds of potentially unproductive back-and-forth.

**Strategy:**  I'm prioritizing a quick deal and securing a price close to my minimum acceptable value.  The potential benefits of a higher price aren't worth the risk of losing time and ultimately getting a worse offer."
