"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000.  This is a significant investment opportunity, and I believe the value it brings to your company will far exceed the price. Let's talk about how this can benefit you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I can only consider a price up to $800000 for the product. I understand its value might exceed this amount, but I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is still a very reasonable price considering the potential benefits you'll gain. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on our previous discussions and my financial capacity, I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product and my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
