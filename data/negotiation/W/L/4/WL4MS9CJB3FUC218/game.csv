"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to consider a price of $10000. Can you meet me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'll sell the product to you for $12500. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider this?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $11000, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll sell the product to you for $13000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to listen to your thoughts.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $13000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer $12200, and that's as low as I can go. Please consider this offer.",12200.0,Bob,6,

"I've made a significant concession, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12200. I'll meet you halfway from my last offer, which is $13000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $12800. This is my final offer, Bob.",12800.0,Alice,7,

"I've made several concessions, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'll make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll sell the product to you for $13200, but I need to emphasize that this is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13200.0,Alice,9,
