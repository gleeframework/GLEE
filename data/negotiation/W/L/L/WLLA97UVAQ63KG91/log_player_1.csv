Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows you to potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob pushes back, while still staying above your minimum.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out.

By offering the product at $950,000, you aim to capture the maximum value from Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
