"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing specific details. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""initially proposing"" and ""starting point for negotiations"" signals my willingness to engage in a back-and-forth discussion. 

My goal is to create an anchor with this high initial offer, hopefully influencing Bob's counteroffer to be more favorable to me. I'm also prepared to walk away from the deal if necessary, as I have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is much higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my valuation and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation. Accepting his offer now would leave a substantial amount of money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product has considerable value beyond your initial assessment, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This shows significant movement on my part while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong but Flexible:** I want to convey that I'm serious about selling at a price that reflects the product's value, but I'm also demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating that Bob might be undervaluing the product and emphasizing potential long-term benefits to sweeten the deal.
* **Strategic Concession:**  My counteroffer is a substantial drop from my initial price but still significantly above Bob's offer and my minimum. This aims to encourage him to make a more substantial move while keeping the negotiation alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,850,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects a sincere desire to reach a deal. I believe this is a fair compromise given our respective valuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I'm willing to push him a little further, especially since we're only on round 4 of 10. I believe a deal can be struck between $1,400,000 and $1,500,000.  I'll use my next counteroffer to signal this target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, I can't accept anything below $1,475,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and acknowledges the value you see in the product. I believe this revised price allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1475000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm setting a clear bottom line with my price while emphasizing that I'm still open to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Justification:** I'm framing the price as a compromise that reflects both parties' interests.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By staying slightly above Bob's last offer but below my guaranteed sale price with John, I'm encouraging Bob to make one final push while still leaving myself with a viable alternative. 

I'm hopeful that Bob will recognize this as a fair deal. However, if he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to consider selling to John to secure my minimum desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,475,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000. This is my final offer, as it's already very close to my budget. Let's see if we can finally reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has signaled that $1,350,000 is his ""final offer."" While I could try to negotiate further, his use of that phrase and the fact that his offer is now significantly below my $1,475,000 bottom line makes it unlikely we'll reach a mutually agreeable price. 

I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. It's time to cut my losses in this negotiation and secure the guaranteed profit.  There's always a risk that John might change his mind, and further haggling with Bob might result in no sale at all."
