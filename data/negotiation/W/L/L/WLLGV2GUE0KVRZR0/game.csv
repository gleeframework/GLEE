"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is much higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my valuation and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product has considerable value beyond your initial assessment, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This shows significant movement on my part while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,850,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects a sincere desire to reach a deal. I believe this is a fair compromise given our respective valuations.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, I can't accept anything below $1,475,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and acknowledges the value you see in the product. I believe this revised price allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1475000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,475,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000. This is my final offer, as it's already very close to my budget. Let's see if we can finally reach a mutually agreeable price.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
