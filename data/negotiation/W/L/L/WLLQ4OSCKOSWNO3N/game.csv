"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're working within a budget, Bob. While $7,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's settle this right now - $8,250, and we have a deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm getting close to my target, but $8,250 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $8,000, which is the price I'm willing to pay. How about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,6,
