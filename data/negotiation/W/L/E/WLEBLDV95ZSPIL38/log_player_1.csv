"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is still above my minimum but a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is a significant concession, but still above my minimum value and closer to Bob's offer.  I hope this will be a final compromise that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum value. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds. To avoid the risk of ending up with a lower price, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $10,000. This guarantees me a sale at my minimum price, securing a safe and predictable outcome."
