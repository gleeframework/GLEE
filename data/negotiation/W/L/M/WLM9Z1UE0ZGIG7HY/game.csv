"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a certain budget in mind, Bob, but I'm afraid $600000 is below the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $900000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my costs. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me and the market value you mentioned earlier.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. I'll meet you at $850000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product.

"I understand you're close to making a decision, Bob, but I'm afraid $800000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $950000 for the product. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're not willing to go below $950000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",825000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to negotiate, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $950000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $925000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I understand that you're not willing to budge on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $925000. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, but I'm starting to think that I'll have to look elsewhere for this product. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,10,
