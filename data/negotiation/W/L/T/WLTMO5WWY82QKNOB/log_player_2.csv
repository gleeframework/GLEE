Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be reasonable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello again Bob, I appreciate your response.  While I understand your perspective, the $600,000 offer significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this revised price reflects the product's unique value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we need to find some middle ground here.  $2,000,000 is still much higher than I'm willing to go. How about $800,000?  That's my best offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I understand where you're coming from, but the gap between our valuations is substantial. To be frank, I have another offer on the table for $1,500,000.  To make this work with you, I need you to meet me closer to that figure. How about $1,750,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I understand you have other offers, but I'm serious about my limit. If you can do $900,000, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've been flexible, but this negotiation is reaching a critical point. I have a standing offer for $1,500,000, and that's a figure I'm comfortable accepting. I'm willing to make one final offer to you: $1,400,000. This is my absolute bottom line. If it doesn't work for you, I wish you the best in your search. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  

* **She's firm:** Alice has made it very clear that $1,400,000 is her absolute bottom line.
* **You have a better option:** John is offering the product for $800,000, a full $600,000 less than Alice's final offer.

Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay. Secure the better deal with John."
