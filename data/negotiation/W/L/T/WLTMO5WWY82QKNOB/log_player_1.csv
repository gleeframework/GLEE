"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello again Bob, I appreciate your response.  While I understand your perspective, the $600,000 offer significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this revised price reflects the product's unique value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find some middle ground here.  $2,000,000 is still much higher than I'm willing to go. How about $800,000?  That's my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has now reached his maximum valuation of the product. While $800,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than John's guaranteed offer.  I'll attempt to negotiate further, but I need to be ready to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob won't budge."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I understand where you're coming from, but the gap between our valuations is substantial. To be frank, I have another offer on the table for $1,500,000.  To make this work with you, I need you to meet me closer to that figure. How about $1,750,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I understand you have other offers, but I'm serious about my limit. If you can do $900,000, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is still significantly below my minimum and hasn't budged much beyond his maximum valuation.  It's time to apply more pressure. I'll reject this offer, making it clear that I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't increase his offer substantially."
