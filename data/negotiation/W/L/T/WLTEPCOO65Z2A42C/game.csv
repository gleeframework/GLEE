"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  How about $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
