{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This gives you a lot of room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This ensures that Bob understands the offer clearly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's closer, I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and get a higher price.  

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired value.  I've already gone through two rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that we are not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  

Rather than risk another round of negotiation and potentially lowering the price further, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I get my desired value and avoids any further potential for a lower price."
