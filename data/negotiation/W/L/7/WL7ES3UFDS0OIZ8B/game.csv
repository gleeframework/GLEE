"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1500000 is at the top of my budget. To make this work, I'd need to come in at $1200000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $1200000 doesn't quite meet my expectations for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1350000.  This price reflects the value I've placed on this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1350000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. To make this work for me, I need to stay at $1250000. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute limit of my budget. Let me know if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $1250000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
