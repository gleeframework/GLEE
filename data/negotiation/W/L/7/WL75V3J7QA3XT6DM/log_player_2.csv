"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Here's why:

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $120.
* **John's price:** $150.

Rejecting Alice's offer means you can get the product for a lower price ($150) from John. While this isn't the absolute lowest price, it's still cheaper than Alice's offer."
