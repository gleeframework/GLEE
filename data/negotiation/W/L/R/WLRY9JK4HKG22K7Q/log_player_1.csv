Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a final price higher than $120 (John's offer).
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the price. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale rather than risking Bob's rejection and having to settle for John's lower offer."
