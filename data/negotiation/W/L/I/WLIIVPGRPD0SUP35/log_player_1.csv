"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to start with a price of $120. This is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $100 to Bob. It gives him some room to negotiate, while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

I'm going to counter with $115. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him."
