"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $15,000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John. It's best to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a low offer like $8,000 gives you room to negotiate upwards. While it's a significant difference from Alice's initial offer, it's important to signal that her first price was unrealistic for your budget. This strategy aims to encourage Alice to counter with a more reasonable price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to your budget, $11,000 is still above what you're willing to pay and what John offers. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're inching closer to both your budget and a potential agreement.  By offering $9,000, you're showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price below your $10,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I can do $11,500, which is my lowest price. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm at $11,500, which is above your $10,000 limit. It's unlikely she'll come down further. You've negotiated well, but it's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price."
