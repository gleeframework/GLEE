"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a price that works for you, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,550,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
