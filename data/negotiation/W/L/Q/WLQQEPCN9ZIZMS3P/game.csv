"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, given its value to you and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer at this price. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $900,000?  This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
