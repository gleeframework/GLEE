"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my maximum value, but I can do better.**  A counteroffer allows me to try and get a lower price. 
* **It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if I can save some money.** 
* **John's offer is my safety net.** If negotiations with Alice fail, I can still buy the product from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, I'm looking to spend less. Would you consider $8,500? It's still a good price for you, and a great deal for me. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $8,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is now within my acceptable range.**  I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, and $9,000 is a significant saving compared to that.
* **There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate will only waste time.** Alice has shown she's firm, and I'm likely to get a similar price if I continue.
* **Accepting saves time and effort.** I can move on to other things instead of negotiating further."
