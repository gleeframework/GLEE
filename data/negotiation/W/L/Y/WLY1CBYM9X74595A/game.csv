"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would still be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for significantly less than its value to you. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
