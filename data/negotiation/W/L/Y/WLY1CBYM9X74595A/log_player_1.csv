``` 

This offer gives me a good profit ($400,000) while still leaving room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but not desperate.  I'm willing to listen to his counteroffer, but I'll also be prepared to walk away and sell to John if the price isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's more than John's offer, I want to try to get closer to my initial price.  I'm going to counter with a price that's still a good deal for Bob, but gives me more profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would still be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for significantly less than its value to you. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's still a good profit for me ($300,000), and it's likely that he won't budge much further.  While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, the risk of him walking away and me having to settle for John's offer is too high.  It's better to secure the deal now."
