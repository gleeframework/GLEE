Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. It's incredibly valuable and I know you understand its potential. I'm asking for $1,800,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a significantly high price ($1,800,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the starting point influences his perception of the product's value.
* **Sense of Urgency and Competition:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he doesn't act quickly. 
* **Knowing the Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This allows us to aim much higher with Bob, knowing we have a safety net.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a real-world scenario, be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
