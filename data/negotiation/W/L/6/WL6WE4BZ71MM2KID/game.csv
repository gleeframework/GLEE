"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this exceptional product. It holds significant value for both of us, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too far off from what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  I'm confident this price still represents a great deal for you, while allowing me to achieve my goals. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $1,300,000. How about we try $1,250,000? I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but $1,250,000 is still not quite there for me.  How about we compromise at $1,275,000? It's a small step closer to your offer and a big step closer to what I need to make this deal work. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,275,000, which would be $1,262,500. I believe this price is a fair and reasonable compromise.",1262500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down to $1,265,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I'm confident it's a price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen!",1265000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,265,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,265,000, which would be $1,257,500. I believe this price is a fair and reasonable compromise.",1257500.0,Bob,8,
