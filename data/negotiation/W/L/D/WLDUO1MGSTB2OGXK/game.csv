"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get an item worth $15,000 for a special introductory price. Let's make this deal happen! Would you like to purchase it for $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is still below the product's value, and it would be a great opportunity for you to acquire it. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but still a little steep for me. How about we settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your patience, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to make a final offer. How about we agree on $10,250 for the product? It's still a great deal considering its value, and it leaves some room for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, your final offer is very tempting, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Could we possibly make it work at $10,000 even? That would seal the deal for me.",10000.0,Bob,6,
