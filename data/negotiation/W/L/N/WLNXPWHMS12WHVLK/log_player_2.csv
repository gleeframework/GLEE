"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired maximum of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively low counteroffer, but still higher than Alice's minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate without appearing unreasonable, and allows him to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Current offer:** $11,000, still above Bob's desired maximum of $12,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:** Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, making a counteroffer in Round 3.  

By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate for a lower price, potentially getting closer to his ideal price point. There's still room to bargain before needing to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Continue to lower the price, but avoid being too aggressive and potentially alienating Alice.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  A counteroffer that's halfway between the last two offers.  
* **Outcome:** This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is still looking for a better deal. It gives Alice room to negotiate without having to come down to Bob's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to negotiate, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, and $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need $11,200 to make it worth my while. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Current offer:** $11,200, still above Bob's desired maximum of $12,000. 
* **Alice's stance:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer, but it's still possible to negotiate. 

While Alice claims this is her final offer, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and has already managed to bring the price down. There's still some room to maneuver, and it's worth attempting one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,950? This is still a good deal for both of us, and it's the closest I can come to your offer. "", ""product_price"": 10950}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Get the price as close to his $12,000 limit as possible.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** Split the difference between Alice's last offer ($11,200) and his previous offer ($10,750). This shows a genuine willingness to compromise while still trying to save money.
* **Outcome:** This counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice. If she rejects, she's closer to having to accept Bob's offer or risk losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,950, but I'm not going to give up on getting the full value of the product. I'll tell you what - I'll do $11,050, and that's as low as I can go. This is my last offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible, but still get the product.
* **Current offer:** $11,050, which is closer to Bob's maximum of $12,000 than John's offer.
* **Negotiation progress:**  Bob has successfully brought the price down from $11,500 to $11,050.  
* **Risk:** Rejecting and counteroffering again could risk losing the deal, as Alice has stated this is her last offer.

While Bob could potentially try to counteroffer again, the risk of losing the deal is high. At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision.  Bob saves $1,450 compared to buying from John."
