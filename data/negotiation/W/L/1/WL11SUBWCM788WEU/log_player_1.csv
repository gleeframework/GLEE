Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate, but ensures I don't lose out on the value of the product. If he rejects, I can always move on to John who is willing to pay my full price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm eager to sell the product, his offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm countering with $11,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm open to negotiation but still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired value, it's still not worth it to continue negotiating. I'm confident that John will purchase the product for my full price.  I'm choosing to cut my losses and sell to John to ensure I get my desired price."
