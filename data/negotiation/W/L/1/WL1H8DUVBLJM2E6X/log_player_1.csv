Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 gives a strong fallback position, allowing for a bolder initial offer to Bob."
