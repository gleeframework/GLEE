Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum desired value ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone helps build rapport and increases the chances of a successful negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the value of the product (""great deal,"" ""very useful"") can make Bob more inclined to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's response and adapt my negotiation strategy based on his actions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob is offering my minimum desired price of $150.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to Bob guarantees me a sale and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation or potentially losing the sale altogether.
* **John's Offer:** While John is offering the same price, there's no guarantee that he'll ultimately buy the product. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice given the current circumstances. It secures my minimum desired profit and eliminates the risk associated with further negotiation."
