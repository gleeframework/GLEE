"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find it within my budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but $80 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  This would still give you a good price on a product that you'll love.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $80. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really want to make this work, but $80 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down one last time to $90. This is a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",90.0,Alice,5,
