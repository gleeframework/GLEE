Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to think it's worth a bit more. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $787,500 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm counteroffering at $812,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has continually met in the middle, and the price difference is getting smaller.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price, and it risks pushing Alice away or running out of rounds. Accepting at $812,500 secures a reasonable deal."
