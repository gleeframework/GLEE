"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
