"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $700000. It's a steal of a deal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is too expensive for me at $700,000. I can get it from John for $1,200,000, so I'd rather wait and buy it from him.
