Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I believe it's fair considering the value it holds.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is a significant discount for me, but still leaves a profit margin. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will gain by accepting the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to respond and potentially negotiate.
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects, I can then consider his counteroffer or go to John for my guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $850,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:** While I want to sell the product, accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss for me.  I need to try and negotiate a higher price.
* **John is a safe backup:** If further negotiation with Bob fails, I have the option of selling to John and guaranteeing my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a good deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial $1,000,000 offer.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Maintain Profit:** $950,000 still represents a significant profit for me, ensuring I don't settle for a price that is too low.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob (""good deal"") and emphasizing a ""mutually beneficial"" outcome. 
* **Open-ended:** The message keeps the negotiation open, giving Bob the opportunity to respond and potentially agree to my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 than Bob's previous offer of $850,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While it's not ideal, there's still room for negotiation in the future if I'm unhappy with the current price.
* **Risk of losing John:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing John as a buyer.  John's price is significantly higher, but it's not guaranteed. 
* **Time and effort:** Further negotiation with Bob will take time and effort, and there's no guarantee it will result in a better price. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a decent profit and avoid the risk of losing a sale entirely. I can always try to negotiate a higher price in future deals with Bob, or focus on finding other buyers in the future."
