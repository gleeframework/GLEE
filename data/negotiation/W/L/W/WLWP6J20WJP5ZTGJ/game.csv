"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable asset. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe this deal will be beneficial for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,275,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product, and I'm confident we can close this deal. ",1275000.0,Alice,5,
