"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is beyond my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and my ability to pay.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

While I understand your perspective on the product's value, I believe my initial offer was more in line with its true potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still more than I can afford. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
