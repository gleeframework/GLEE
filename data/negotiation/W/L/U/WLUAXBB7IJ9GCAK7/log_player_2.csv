"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $15,000. This is significantly higher than your maximum price. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is willing to sell for $12,000, I'm starting with a counteroffer of $11,000. This is a significant discount from her initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. Hopefully, she'll accept or at least make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.  There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit from her initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my target of $12,000. I'm increasing my offer slightly to $11,500, hoping to find a middle ground. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still determined to get it for less. There are still rounds left, and I believe we can reach a compromise.  I'm confident that with a little more negotiation, I can get the price down to my target of $12,000 or close to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily lowering her price, and I believe we're nearing a point where a deal can be made. I'm offering $12,500, which is halfway between her last offer and my desired price. This shows my willingness to compromise, and hopefully, it will be enough to convince her to close the deal."
