```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his $10,000 limit as possible.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has finally come down to $10,800, which is within Bob's budget and only $800 more than his desired price.  While Bob could continue to try and negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer again and leaving him with only 3 rounds to buy from John increases significantly.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while still saving $200 compared to buying from John."
