{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset for a price below its worth to you, and I get a strong return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? That feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value while leaving some room for me on the table. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $1,050,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial one, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product while giving you a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'll accept his offer."
