"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset for a price below its worth to you, and I get a strong return on my investment. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? That feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value while leaving some room for me on the table.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product while giving you a good deal.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
