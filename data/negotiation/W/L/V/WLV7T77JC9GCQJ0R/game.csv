"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $175 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $140?  I'm sure we can work something out.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $155? That's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $152.50?  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",152.5,Bob,4,
