"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counteroffer is a starting point to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. It's a significant drop from her initial price, but still leaves room for bargaining to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above your budget and what John is offering. You're willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to find a compromise. It's a significant jump from your previous offer but still below your maximum budget and Alice's last offer. This shows you are willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but that's as close as I can get to your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met your upper limit, and it matches what John offers.  There's no point in further negotiation or going with John, as the price won't be better."
