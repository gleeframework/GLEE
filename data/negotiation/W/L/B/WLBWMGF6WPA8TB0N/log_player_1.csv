"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by counteroffering. I also have the option to sell to John for $10,000, which gives me some leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? It's a fair price that gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11,500. I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is above my minimum threshold of $10,000 and is getting closer to my desired price.  Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids further negotiation risk. While I could try for a higher price, there's a chance Bob might reject my next offer, leading to a stalemate or needing to sell to John for a lower price.  Accepting this offer is the most pragmatic choice."
