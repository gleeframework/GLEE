"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's significantly below its true value to me. I know it's worth $8,000 to you, so I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a great price, and I get to sell it to someone who will truly appreciate it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
