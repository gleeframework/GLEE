"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer, and it's still below Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might become less flexible, and he could end up paying John's higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a fair price without unnecessary risk."
