"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept. $600,000 is a good deal, but you can likely do better.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you more information and negotiating power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will gauge her willingness to negotiate and hopefully prompt her to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$500,000 is still a good price, but I believe there's still room for further negotiation.  I'm going to reject and counter-offer to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still believe it's worth less than her current offer. Hopefully, this will lead to a more favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, but it's getting close to my limit.  $550,000 is a reasonable price and a significant savings compared to John's offer.  It's time to accept and finalize the deal."
