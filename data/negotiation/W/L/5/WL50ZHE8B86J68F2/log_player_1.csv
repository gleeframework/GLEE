Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $125?  That would make it a really good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
