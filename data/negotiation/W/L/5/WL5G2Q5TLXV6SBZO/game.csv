"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe it's a bit high, considering I've done some research and seen similar products on the market for lower prices. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. It's unique in the market and offers significant benefits that similar products don't. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900000 feels more reasonable considering its potential. Let's meet in the middle, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",850000.0,Bob,4,
