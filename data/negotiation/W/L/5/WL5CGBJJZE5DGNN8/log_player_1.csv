Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to offer $1100000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
