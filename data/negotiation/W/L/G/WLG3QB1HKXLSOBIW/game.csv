"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,000 is below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's a fair price that still gives you a great deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I appreciate your flexibility. $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  Would you consider $9,500?  That's a fair price that would be mutually beneficial. ",9500.0,Alice,5,
