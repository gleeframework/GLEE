"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly lower than Bob's value but still above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good deal. I'm also being positive and friendly to build a rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate. I've only had one round and Bob's initial counteroffer is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm going to try to counter and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,000 is below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's a fair price that still gives you a great deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
I'm sticking to a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this compromise will be appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about $9,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and a price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your flexibility. $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  Would you consider $9,500?  That's a fair price that would be mutually beneficial. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm raising the price just slightly from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but not willing to give away too much. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're finding common ground. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. It's a strong offer and reflects my commitment to getting this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $9,250.  This is a good deal for me and is close enough to what I was hoping for. It is also a strong offer and shows commitment from Bob. I'm ready to close the deal."
