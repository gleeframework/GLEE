"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to consider a more reasonable price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
