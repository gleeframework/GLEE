"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's get this deal done!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer to make this work.  I'm willing to accept $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to profit significantly from this product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground here. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a significant price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 just isn't enough for me to consider.  I'm willing to go down to $850,000 as a final compromise. This is a substantial price reduction, and it still allows you to gain a significant advantage with this product.  Let's make this deal happen.  If you're not interested at this price,  I'll have to move forward with another buyer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
