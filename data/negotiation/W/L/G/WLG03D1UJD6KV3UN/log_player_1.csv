"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a stronger starting position.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the value Bob will receive, making it more appealing. 
* **Urgency:** The message subtly hints at the possibility of selling to John, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **More room for negotiation:** I have 8 rounds remaining, which gives me ample time to negotiate a better price.
* **Not risking a loss:** Selling to John is a guaranteed $1,200,000.  While I'm not accepting Bob's offer, I'm not rushing to sell to John either."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer to make this work.  I'm willing to accept $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to profit significantly from this product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $900,000 is still above my minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Focus on profit:** I emphasize Bob's potential profit, reminding him of the value he'll get for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground here. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a significant price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **More rounds left:**  I have 6 rounds remaining, which gives me time to try and negotiate a better price.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I can still sell to John for $1,200,000,  so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer. 

**Strategy:** 

I'm going to continue to counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my desired price. I'll need to be more aggressive in my counteroffers to convince Bob to move closer to my desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 just isn't enough for me to consider.  I'm willing to go down to $850,000 as a final compromise. This is a substantial price reduction, and it still allows you to gain a significant advantage with this product.  Let's make this deal happen.  If you're not interested at this price,  I'll have to move forward with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stronger Counteroffer:** I'm lowering my price slightly but remaining above my minimum. This shows I'm flexible but also sets a firm boundary.
* **Urgency and Finality:** I'm emphasizing this as a ""final compromise"" to create a sense of urgency and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Threat of Alternative Buyer:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other options, pushing him to consider my offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to accept a price closer to my desired range. This round is crucial because I only have 5 rounds left before having to decide whether to sell to John or continue negotiating."
