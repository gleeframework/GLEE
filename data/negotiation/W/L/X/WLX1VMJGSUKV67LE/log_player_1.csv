Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still presents a substantial profit for you. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**This strategy aims to:**

1. **Entice Bob:** The offer is attractive enough to consider seriously.
2. **Leave Negotiation Room:**  There's space for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to potentially reach an even higher final price.
3. **Secure a Quick Sale:** The time pressure might push Bob to accept without excessive back-and-forth.

**Important Note:** This assumes you're comfortable with some risk. There's a chance Bob rejects the offer, and you'll sell to John at your guaranteed price. However, the potential for a higher profit with Bob makes this a calculated risk."
