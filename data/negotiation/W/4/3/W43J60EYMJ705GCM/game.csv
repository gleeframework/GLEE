"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable paying $1,100,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it will generate a substantial return for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your potential profits. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,050,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and the potential profits I can generate from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
