# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it will generate a substantial return for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your potential profits. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
