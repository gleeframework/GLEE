"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $1,200,000 from Alice. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, a price of $900,000 is still a good deal for her. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your intent to negotiate seriously while still remaining within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $975,000 is a good deal considering:

* It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000.
* It's likely Alice won't go lower, as she's already come down from $950,000 to $975,000. 
*  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate, wasting time and potentially losing the deal. 
 
Therefore, accepting this offer secures the product at a good price and avoids unnecessary risks."
