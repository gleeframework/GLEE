Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $850,000 is far below what the product is truly worth.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm confident this offer is still attractive to you.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a price we can agree on.  While $900,000 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to go down to $950,000 to finalize the deal.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
