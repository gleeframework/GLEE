,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $850,000 is far below what the product is truly worth.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm confident this offer is still attractive to you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own limitations.  Let's find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a price we can agree on.  While $900,000 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to go down to $950,000 to finalize the deal.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
