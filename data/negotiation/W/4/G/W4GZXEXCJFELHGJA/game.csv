"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the market value of the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get the product for a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also giving you a good deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for a little less.  How about $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $11,750. This is still a good price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11750.0,Alice,5,
