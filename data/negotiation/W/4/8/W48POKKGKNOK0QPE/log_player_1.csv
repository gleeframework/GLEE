Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Aiming slightly below your guaranteed price with John ($1,200,000) creates room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" piques Bob's interest and justifies the high price point.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further""  signals flexibility and willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
