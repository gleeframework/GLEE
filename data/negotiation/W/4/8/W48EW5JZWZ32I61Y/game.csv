"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a truly unique opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a significant amount to me. I'm confident it can be just as valuable to you.  My asking price is $1500000. Please consider the potential this product holds and let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1250000 is closer, I'm still not there yet.  Given the value I place on this product,  I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll receive from the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1300000 is closer to my desired outcome, I'm still not comfortable at that price.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the unique value of this product.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $1325000. Can you consider this price?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
