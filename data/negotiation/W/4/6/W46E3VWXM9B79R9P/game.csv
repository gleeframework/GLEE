"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? This is a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product you need at a price that works for me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my means. How about we meet at $8,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this purchase, and I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product.",8500.0,Bob,4,
