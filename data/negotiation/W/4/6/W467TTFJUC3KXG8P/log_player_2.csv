"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $950,000 is slightly out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's closer to his desired price, Bob can still try to negotiate further. He's only had 3 rounds so far, and has a lot of time left to get a better deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his budget. He has already made a significant counteroffer and only has 5 rounds left. There's still room to negotiate, and Bob can potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $885,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $870,000, but that's my absolute limit.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Considering the value of the product and your budget constraints, I am proposing a price of $880,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been negotiating for several rounds, and while Alice's offer is getting closer to his budget, he only has 3 rounds left.  At this point, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is high. Since John is offering the product for $800,000, which is within Bob's budget, it's a safer and more financially advantageous decision to buy from John.  He can secure the product at his desired price and avoid any further risk of negotiation."
