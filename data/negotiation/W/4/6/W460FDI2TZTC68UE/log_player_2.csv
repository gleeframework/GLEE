"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's not worth accepting Alice's offer at $12,000. You can get the same product from John for $8,000.  It's best to see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
``` 

This is your best starting point. You're offering the maximum you're willing to pay, and it's significantly lower than Alice's asking price.  This sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Alice's offer is better than her initial offer, but it's still not ideal. It's worthwhile to try to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

You're moving closer to Alice's price but still showing you're serious about getting a good deal. This counteroffer demonstrates you're willing to compromise while staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is tempting, it's still not the best deal.  You're very close to your target price, and there's still room for Alice to move a bit more. It's worth one more round of negotiation to see if you can get that extra $500 off."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing you're willing to meet Alice halfway while staying within your budget.  It's a reasonable amount that might push Alice to accept and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

It's time to stop negotiating with Alice. You've reached a point where the offers are getting closer to your maximum price, but it's not worth risking more rounds to save a small amount of money. You can buy the product from John for $8,000, which is your best option at this point."
