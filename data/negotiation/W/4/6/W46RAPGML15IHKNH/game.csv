"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is important to you, but so is staying within my budget.  Could you do $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $825,000 again, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer. Given your final offer and my budget, I can do $800,000.  Take it or leave it.",800000.0,Bob,8,
