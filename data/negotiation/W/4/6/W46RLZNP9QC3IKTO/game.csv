"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. Considering its value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $12,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you trying to find middle ground.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I'm willing to move closer to your original price. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
