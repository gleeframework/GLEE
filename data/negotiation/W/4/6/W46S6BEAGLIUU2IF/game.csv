"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm confident we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $950,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $1,050,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  This is my final offer. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $980,000. Let's see if we can make a deal.",980000.0,Bob,6,
