Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm confident we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  I'll see if I can push for a better price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $950,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $1,050,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  This is my final offer. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $980,000. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, I'm feeling the pressure of time and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to risk a further negotiation with Bob that could result in a lower price."
