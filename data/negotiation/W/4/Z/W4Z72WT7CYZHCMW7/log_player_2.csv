Given its exceptional value and quality, it is worth $800,000 to us. However, I understand that negotiations are key in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. Therefore, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product at a special introductory price of $750,000. This offer is valid for a limited time only. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this proposal. I am confident that together we can make this transaction successful and rewarding for both parties.

Alice is offering the product for $750,000, which is less than your maximum budget of $800,000.  Even though you could buy it from John for $800,000, accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000."
