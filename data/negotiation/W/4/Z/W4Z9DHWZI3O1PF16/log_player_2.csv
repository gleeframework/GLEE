"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm confident you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,500 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John. There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she's willing to go lower."
