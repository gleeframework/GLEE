"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good starting point while still leaving room to negotiate.  It's important to remember that I have a fallback option with John, so I don't have to settle for anything less than $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $120 is too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is a compromise, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is way too low. While I'm not thrilled about potentially selling to John for $150, I'd rather take that than settle for such a low price. I'll keep negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering with $160.  I'm willing to lower my price a bit more to reach an agreement.  I'm hoping Bob is willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still confident I can get a better price than $150 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly unreasonable.  While I'd prefer to get more than $150, I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation and I'm running out of time.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit and ensures I don't risk getting a lower price from Bob."
