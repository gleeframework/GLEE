"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value the product brings to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. Considering your maximum budget, I'm willing to make a slight concession and sell the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,5,
