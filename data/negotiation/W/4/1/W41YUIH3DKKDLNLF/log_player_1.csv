Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. My asking price is $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $11,500, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Clear Message:** I'm being direct and friendly, giving a reason for the price and opening the dialogue for negotiation. 
* **Strategic:** This initial offer leaves room for Bob to counter, but it also makes it clear I'm not willing to sell for much less than $11,500. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've made a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth negotiating further. If not, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a little high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even lower than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity to counter:** I can likely get a better price by countering Bob's offer and negotiating further. 
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage in the negotiation. If I can't get a satisfactory price from Bob, I can always sell to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $9,000 is too low for me. Given the product's value, I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  Instead of rejecting Bob's offer outright, I'm showing willingness to compromise. $10,500 is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain leverage:** By offering a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation open and prevent losing out on the deal entirely.
* **Strong justification:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer (""given the product's value""). This keeps the negotiation focused on the product's worth. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've achieved a good price and made a decent profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess the situation. If Bob counters with something close to $10,500, I might consider accepting. If not, I'll likely accept John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly the value he perceives the product to be. This is a fair compromise, as I've already negotiated down from my initial asking price.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate further might result in a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely.  Time spent negotiating could be better spent finding other buyers. 
* **Meeting my minimum:**  While $10,000 is not my ideal price, it does meet my minimum acceptable value for the product.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction. This secures a sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
