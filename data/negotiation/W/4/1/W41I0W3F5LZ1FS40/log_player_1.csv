Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($15,000) as a negotiation tactic. This gives me room to lower the price if needed. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and enthusiastic tone might make Bob more open to the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  While I don't know the exact value to Bob, I'm suggesting it's a ""fantastic product"" to pique his interest.

**Important Notes:**

* **John's Offer:** This is a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $10,000. 
* **Bob's Knowledge:**  I don't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay, so this is a gamble. 
* **Negotiation Strategies:** I'll need to adapt my offers based on Bob's responses and potentially use strategies like anchoring, concessions, and deadlines."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's counteroffer of $12,000 is still above my minimum threshold of $10,000, but it's significantly lower than my initial offer. This indicates that Bob is serious about buying the product, but he's not willing to pay the full asking price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm rejecting his offer because I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. 
* **Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between $12,000 and my desired price (somewhere between $12,000 and $15,000)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position. Let's meet in the middle. How about $13,500?  It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $13,500, which is a compromise between Bob's offer of $12,000 and my previous offer of $15,000.
* **Reasoning:** This is a good middle ground that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to maximize my profit. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to encourage continued negotiations. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating that this is still a ""good deal"" to reinforce the product's value. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll wait to see if Bob accepts my counteroffer or makes a new counteroffer.
* **Adapting Strategy:** Based on Bob's response, I can adjust my next offer accordingly. If Bob is willing to pay closer to $13,500, I might offer a slight concession. If he's not budging, I might consider lowering my price more significantly or ending negotiations."
