"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000.  This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum value. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher. I still have 8 rounds left and can always sell to John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still hoping to get a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $100,000 more than my minimum acceptable price and it's getting closer to my initial target. I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal. There's no guarantee that I can get a higher price in the remaining rounds and there's always the risk that negotiations might break down completely.  I think it's wiser to secure this deal and move on."
