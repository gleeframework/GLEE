"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $11,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $12,000 even?",12000.0,Alice,5,
