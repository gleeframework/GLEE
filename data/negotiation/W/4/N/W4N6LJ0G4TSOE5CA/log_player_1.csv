{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,500. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but won't go too far below my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my ideal price. I'm not ready to accept yet, but I need to consider if further negotiation is worth it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to make one final counteroffer at $10,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, and I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a deal done. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I've already made several concessions, and it's clear that we won't be able to reach an agreement.  I'm better off selling to John for $15,000."
