Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum threshold of $12,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $11,000 just isn't feasible for me right now. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12,200. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,200 is above my minimum threshold of $12,000 and is a good price considering the back and forth negotiation. Accepting this offer is the best option, as it yields a higher profit than selling to John for $12,000."
