Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  $14,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net.  If negotiations with Bob stall, you have a backup option.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $14,000 allows for a potential compromise if Bob counters with a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I can still potentially get a better price.  
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is a strong safety net, giving me the leverage to negotiate more aggressively.

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows us both to reach a compromise. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer splits the difference between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's counter-offer ($12,500).  It shows a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $13,250 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive tone, emphasizing the potential for a win-win outcome. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  John's offer is a constant reminder that I can walk away from this negotiation and still get a good price.

**Note:** This counter-offer balances the need to earn a decent profit with the desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $12,800 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer provides a strong safety net, allowing me to hold out for a better price.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my previous counteroffer, there's still room for further negotiation.
