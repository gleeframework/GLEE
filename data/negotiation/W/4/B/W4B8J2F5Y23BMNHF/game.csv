"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8250.0,Alice,3,
