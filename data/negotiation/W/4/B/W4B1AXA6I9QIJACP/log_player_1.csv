Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a range that earns you a significant profit.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a fallback option with John ($8,000), so there's less pressure to accept a lowball offer from Bob."
