"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I understand the value of the product to you is $800,000, and my asking price reflects that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would leave us both with a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
