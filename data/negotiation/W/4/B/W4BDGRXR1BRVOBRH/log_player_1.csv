I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, it seems Bob is not willing to budge much further. I've had 6 rounds with Bob and it seems we're stuck in a stalemate. Selling to John guarantees me the highest price possible, and it's worth the risk of potentially getting a higher offer from Bob in the next few rounds."
