"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $140 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price in a counter-offer. If not, you can always buy from John for $150."
