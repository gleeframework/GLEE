Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $100 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:**  While you could start higher, there's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. This price aims to maximize your profit while increasing the chance of a successful sale."
