"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it allows for room to negotiate down if needed. I believe this initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and set a high starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for negotiation. I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round. This will allow me to see if Bob is willing to pay more and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is still above my minimum, but a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing willingness to compromise. It's a reasonable middle ground that might encourage Bob to accept and still allows for potential further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge from his initial offer. I've already lowered my price considerably and I'm concerned further negotiation will simply lead to more wasted rounds.  Selling to John at my minimum acceptable price is the best course of action to ensure a quick and guaranteed sale."
