"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its value and significance to both of us, I propose a price of $15000. This reflects not only the product's worth but also the opportunity it presents for both parties. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer considering its high value. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to negotiating at that price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
