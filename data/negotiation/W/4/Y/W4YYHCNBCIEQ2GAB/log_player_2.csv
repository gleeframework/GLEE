You have a lot of room to negotiate.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but there's no reason to settle immediately. You can counteroffer and see if you can get a better deal."

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer.  $500,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay.  This should give us some room to negotiate."

We've been going back and forth, and it seems we're stuck. Alice is not budging, and I'm getting close to my maximum budget. It's better to go with John at this point, even if it's a bit more expensive."
