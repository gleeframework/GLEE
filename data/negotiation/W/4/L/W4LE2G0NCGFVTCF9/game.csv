"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $10,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach a deal. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still not quite there. $10,600 is the highest I'm willing to go at this point. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,600 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $10,650 to make this worthwhile. Let's make this the final offer, and close this deal. ",10650.0,Alice,5,
