"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $10,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach a deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,750 is closer to your budget, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to see if you can get the price down further before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still not quite there. $10,600 is the highest I'm willing to go at this point. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,600 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $10,650 to make this worthwhile. Let's make this the final offer, and close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's likely you won't be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  While $10,650 is higher than your ideal price, it's still a good deal compared to the $11,000 she initially asked. Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product without further haggling, and it's still within your budget."
