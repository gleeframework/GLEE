Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned it has. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This is my final offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a reasonable middle ground. However, we're still significantly above our minimum acceptable price.  We'll apply a bit more pressure by rejecting and countering, but we need to be cautious as we proceed."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could potentially push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,280,000 is a good outcome. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** We're still making a $280,000 profit above our minimum.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation has risks.  Bob could walk away, or unforeseen circumstances could arise. 
* **Relationship:** Accepting shows Bob we're willing to make a deal, which is good for future business."
