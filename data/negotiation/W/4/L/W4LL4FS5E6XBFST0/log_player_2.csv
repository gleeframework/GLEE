"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price of $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  He values the product at $150, and Alice's offer is already below her value of $120. This suggests there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $115 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob aims to maximize his savings. By offering $115, he's pushing the price closer to Alice's value of $120, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Message Tone:** Bob keeps the message friendly and focuses on the value proposition rather than simply rejecting the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $115 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Proposition:** Alice's offer of $125 is within Bob's budget and only $5 above his initial counteroffer. This represents a significant saving compared to buying from John for $150.
* **Negotiation Exhaustion:**  Further negotiation could result in a lower price but might also lead to a stalemate. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
