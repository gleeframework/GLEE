"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. I think it's a great deal for something of such high quality."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I know John is ready to buy at that price right now. There's no guarantee Bob will offer more in future rounds, so it's more strategic to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
