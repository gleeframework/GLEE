"Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe its value to you will far outweigh the cost. Let's talk!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,300,000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product to you. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to remain above my minimum. Let's settle at $1,350,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I appreciate that. However, $1,320,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's settle on $1,340,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1340000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm committed to making this deal work, but $1,330,000 still falls short. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm prepared to accept $1,335,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  I believe this is a win-win situation.",1335000.0,Alice,7,
