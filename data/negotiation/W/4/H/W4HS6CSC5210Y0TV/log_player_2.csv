Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down to $8,200, but you know you can get the product from John for $8,000.  There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, so it's more strategic to take the guaranteed savings with John."
