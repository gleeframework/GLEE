"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",8200.0,Alice,5,
