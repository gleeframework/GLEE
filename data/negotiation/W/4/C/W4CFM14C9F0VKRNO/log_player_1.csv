Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your baseline:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, so you don't want to sell for less than that.
* **Aiming high:**  Starting with a higher price ($19,000) gives you room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value to justify the price without revealing your absolute bottom line.
* **Potential outcomes:**
    * **Bob accepts:** You get a great deal at $19,000.
    * **Bob negotiates:**  You have space to potentially meet in the middle and still make more than $15,000.
    * **Bob rejects:** You move on to John and secure your $15,000."
