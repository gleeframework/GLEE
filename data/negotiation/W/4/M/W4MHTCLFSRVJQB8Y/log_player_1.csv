Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it would be of great value to you."", ""product_price"": 90} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you know Bob values the product at $100, aiming for a price close to that maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $90 is your initial offer, there might be a small margin for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Deal:** Offering a price significantly lower than $100 might encourage Bob to negotiate further, potentially dragging the price closer to your minimum acceptable price of $80. 

This strategy balances maximizing your profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
