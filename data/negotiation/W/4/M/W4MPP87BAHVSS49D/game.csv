"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering its worth, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm currently working with a budget that allows me to spend no more than $8000 on this purchase. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $8000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering the product for $10000, which is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my current budget constraints, I'm unable to meet the price of $10000. I was hoping to stay within the $8000 range. Would it be possible for us to find a middle ground? Perhaps somewhere around $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
