"Alice, I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget for this purchase.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product,  given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price reflects the value it can bring to your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,100,000 still falls short of the product's true value and what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair offer considering the product's potential to benefit your business.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,600,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  This represents a significant investment on my end and a fair compromise considering our current positions.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
