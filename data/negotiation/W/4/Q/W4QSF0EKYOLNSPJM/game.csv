"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $800000. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $900000. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate further. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a new price of $1050000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product and my original asking price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
