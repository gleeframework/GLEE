"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,050,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation. Buying from John at $1,000,000 ensures the best price for me."
