"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $12,000 to you and I believe it could greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $12,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $10,000 is better than that, but there's room for negotiation.  There are 10 rounds, so Bob has time to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I would like to propose a slightly higher price. How about $9,500 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $9,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $12,000.
* **It's a good deal for Bob:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or increase her price.  Accepting $9,500 saves Bob $2,500 compared to buying from John.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 10 rounds, it's better to secure a good deal than risk losing the opportunity to a higher counter-offer from Alice."
