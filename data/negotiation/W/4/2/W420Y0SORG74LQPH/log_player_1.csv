"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm going for a high price since I don't know Bob's value for the product. This will give me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  Remember, I can always sell to John for $80, so I won't accept anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a little more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $85 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit higher than my budget, but I'm willing to go to $90.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my initial asking price that it's worth accepting. I'm happy to close the deal at $90.  I'm confident that I've gotten a good price given the limited information I had about Bob's value for the product."
