Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. Alice shouldn't accept anything less from Bob."
