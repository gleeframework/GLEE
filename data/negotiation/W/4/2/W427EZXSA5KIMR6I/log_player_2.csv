{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a great price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. How about we settle on $120? It's a slight increase from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
