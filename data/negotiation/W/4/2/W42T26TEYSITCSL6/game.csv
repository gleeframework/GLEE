"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, how about $105? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about $97.50? That's a good compromise, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $97.50 is still a little lower than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - how about $101.25? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about $98? That's a small step up from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",98.0,Bob,6,
