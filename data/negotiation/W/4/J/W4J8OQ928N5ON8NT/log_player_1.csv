Send your offer to Bob.,"I'm excited to start the negotiation!

Here's my initial offer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 12,500}

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above the minimum value of the product to me, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still a decent offer. I'll think carefully about my next move...

I decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not ready to sell the product for $10,000, so I'll send Bob a counteroffer to try to get a better price. Let's see what he thinks!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000, so I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 11,500}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle or come closer to my initial offer. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm getting closer! I'll think carefully about my next move...

I decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not quite ready to sell the product for $10,500, so I'll send Bob another counteroffer to try to get a better price. Let's see what he thinks!

(I'm also keeping an eye on the option to sell the product to John for $10,000, but I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob just yet!)"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,500, so I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 11,000}

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where Bob will be willing to meet me, and I'm hoping this offer will be the one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is back to $10,000, and I've already considered selling to John for that price. I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price, so I'll think carefully about my next move...

I decide to:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've had a good run with negotiating with Bob, but I think it's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $10,000. It's not the highest price I could have gotten, but it's still a decent deal. Time to move on to the next opportunity!"
