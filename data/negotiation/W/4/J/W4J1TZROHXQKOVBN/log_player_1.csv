Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $80, which is a good start. 
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $120, so he's likely to accept an offer below that.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers, you have room to negotiate a price that's still favorable to you. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
