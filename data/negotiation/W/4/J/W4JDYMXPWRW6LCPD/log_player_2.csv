"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product from John for $100, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $120.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you a chance to potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is lower than Alice's initial offer, but it still provides Alice with a profit margin.  It's a starting point for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what John is selling the product for. It's better to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price. There's a chance that Alice will lower her offer again, and you can always buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is closer to Alice's last offer, but still gives Alice a decent profit margin. It's a compromise that acknowledges Alice's need to make a profit while still being within your budget.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still more expensive than John's price.  There's a chance Alice could come down further, or you can make a counteroffer again. It's best to continue trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a compromise between your last offer and Alice's current offer. It acknowledges the possibility that Alice may not be willing to go lower than $110, but it still represents a significant saving compared to her initial offer.  If Alice rejects this offer, you can consider buying from John or making another counteroffer, but this offer leaves room for a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget, and you only have 3 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks running out of time and ending up with a worse deal. It's best to secure the product from John at $100 and avoid further negotiation."
