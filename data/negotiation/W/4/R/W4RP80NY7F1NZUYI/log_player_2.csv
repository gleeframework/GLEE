"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is less than his maximum, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He's offering a price that's still profitable for Alice, but provides him with a considerable saving. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown a willingness to compromise and is likely to get closer to his target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000. I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $11,500?  It's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he is also showing a willingness to compromise. He is offering a price that is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows that he is serious about making a deal, but he is not willing to overpay."
