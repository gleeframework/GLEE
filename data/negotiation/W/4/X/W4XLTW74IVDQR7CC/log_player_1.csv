"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've described. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not yet ready to settle for that. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe the product's value warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
I will accept Bob's offer. $16,000 is a good price, exceeding my minimum of $15,000 and leaving some room for profit.  It's also a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by being too stubborn."
