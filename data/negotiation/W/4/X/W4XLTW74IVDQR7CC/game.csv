"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've described.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $15000 is my minimum, I believe the product's value warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $17500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",16000.0,Bob,4,
