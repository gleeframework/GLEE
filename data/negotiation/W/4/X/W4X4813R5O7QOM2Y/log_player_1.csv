"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $85. I believe this is a fair price that Bob might be willing to accept, given his value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $90,  $87 is a better price than selling to John, and the negotiations are getting lengthy. There's a good chance Bob might not budge further, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
