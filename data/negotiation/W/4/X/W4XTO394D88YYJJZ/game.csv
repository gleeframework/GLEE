,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $107.50 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $100?",100.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go as low as $98?",98.0,Bob,6,
