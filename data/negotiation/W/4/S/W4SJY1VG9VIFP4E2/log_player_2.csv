"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is at your maximum price, there's no reason to rush into accepting it. There's a chance Alice may be willing to lower the price to secure a sale. We'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**  We start with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows we're serious about buying but also trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? I'm confident you won't regret it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has moved closer to our desired price, but we're still within our budget. It's worth another round of negotiation to try to push her down a bit further. We're confident we can get a better deal than $135."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $135 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would make it a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**  We've moved closer to Alice's offer, but we're still aiming for a price below her last offer. By suggesting a meeting in the middle, we show we're willing to compromise but also want to demonstrate that we're still aiming for a better price for ourselves."
