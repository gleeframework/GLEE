"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? I'm confident you won't regret it.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $135 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would make it a great deal for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
