"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's the highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,5,
