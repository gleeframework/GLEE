"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $100 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $102.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $97.50.  This is really my final offer, let's see if we can agree on this.",97.5,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be flexible, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $97.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $101.25. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",101.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $97.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to go any higher. If you're willing to accept, we can close the deal now. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John.",97.5,Bob,8,
