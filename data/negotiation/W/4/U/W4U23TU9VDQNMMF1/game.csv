"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,500. Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $500. That brings the total value to $11,500, but I'll sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras, but I'm still working with a tight budget. While I see the value in the service, I'm only able to offer $10,750 for the product. This price is within my budget and reflects the value I see in the deal. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go below $11,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in another service that's worth $200, which I'll include with the product. That's a total value of $11,200, but I'll sell it to you for $10,900. What do you think?",10900.0,Alice,7,
