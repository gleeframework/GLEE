"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm hoping he values the product highly, but if not, I'm ready to negotiate down in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer. I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000, still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but also that I'm not desperate to accept his low offer."
