"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still potentially appealing to Bob.
* **Building a relationship:** I'm starting with a friendly message to establish a good rapport and make Bob feel valued.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The initial offer leaves room for negotiation, allowing for potential counteroffers and a chance to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:**  While Bob is interested, his offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob by rejecting his offer and counter-offering. 
* **John is a safety net:** Having John as a backup buyer provides security, allowing me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between my minimum ($100) and Bob's offer ($90), demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging further negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $105 is still above my minimum,  allowing for further negotiation if Bob rejects my offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited time:** We're already in round 4, and the negotiations might not progress further. 
* **John is a backup:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for $100, so there's minimal risk in accepting this offer. 

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer because it's a good compromise that maximizes my earnings within the limited timeframe of our negotiations."
