"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to my budget. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price still provides you with a substantial value and allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a little higher than I'd like to be, but I'm willing to go to $925,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good outcome.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",925000.0,Bob,4,
