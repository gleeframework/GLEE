Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe its value is quite high, but I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and my minimum ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""high value"" and offering it to Bob before a public listing, I'm creating a sense of exclusivity and potential for a deal.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone remains open for negotiation.  If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can always lower the price, potentially still selling above my minimum. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John if Bob declines, so there's no risk of losing money."
