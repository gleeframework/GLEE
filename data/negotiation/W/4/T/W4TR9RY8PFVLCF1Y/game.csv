"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe it's a bit higher than the product's worth.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This acknowledges the value it holds for you while still reflecting a fair price.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and what I'm willing to pay.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this simple - $850,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $825,000 or lower. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",825000.0,Bob,6,
