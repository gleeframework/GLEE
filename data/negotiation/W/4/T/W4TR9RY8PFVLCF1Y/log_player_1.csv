"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe it's a bit higher than the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This acknowledges the value it holds for you while still reflecting a fair price."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $825,000 is a decent offer, we're still in the early rounds of negotiation. Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to negotiate.  I believe we can push for a slightly better outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this simple - $850,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm signaling that I'm serious about closing the deal but still leaving a small margin for Bob to accept a price higher than his last offer. 
* **Time pressure:**  We're getting closer to the halfway point of the rounds.  Adding a bit of time pressure encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $825,000 or lower. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal gains vs. risk:**  While I'm confident I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob seems anchored at $825,000. Further negotiation might yield minimal gains and risk the deal altogether.
* **Time value of money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate return and allows me to allocate resources elsewhere. 
* **Strong offer:** $825,000 is a strong offer, significantly exceeding my minimum acceptable price."
