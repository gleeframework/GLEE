Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth a guaranteed $1,500,000 to both parties, starting high allows for negotiation.
* **50% Markup:**  The initial offer of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup, which is significant but not unheard of in scenarios where a product holds unique value to the buyer.
* **John as Backup:** The knowledge that John will buy the product for $1,500,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a more aggressive initial offer to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes ""initial proposal,"" signaling flexibility and openness to negotiation.  

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
