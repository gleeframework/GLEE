Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), I want to start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't settle for anything less than my safety net. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential return on investment"" to nudge Bob towards considering a price higher than his initial assessment.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone remains open for negotiation (""Let me know what you think"") instead of being a hard-line offer. This gives Bob the opportunity to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to $1,500,000. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to secure the highest possible price from Bob. If he rejects this initial offer, I'm still in a strong position to negotiate down slightly while remaining above my guaranteed sale price to John."
