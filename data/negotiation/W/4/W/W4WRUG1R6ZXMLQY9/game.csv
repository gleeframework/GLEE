"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. To make this work, I'd need to come down to $1,200,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering its value, and it gives us both a chance to make a deal. Let me know if you're open to that.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
