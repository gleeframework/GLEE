"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's true value.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,000, so I can offer $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
