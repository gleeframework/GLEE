Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,100,000?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price point.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
