Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,350,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,175,000.  This shows my commitment to acquiring the product while staying within my budget.  What do you think?

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is more than Bob's current offer and saves time/potential further haggling."
