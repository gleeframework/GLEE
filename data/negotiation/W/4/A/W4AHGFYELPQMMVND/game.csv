,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not comfortable going down to $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to go up to $8,900. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,150. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",9150.0,Alice,7,
