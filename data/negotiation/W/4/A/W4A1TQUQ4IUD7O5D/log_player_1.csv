Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob is interested but thinks the price is too high. I'm also hoping to gauge his interest level and understand his potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I'm going to try and get a little closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my initial price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is just above my minimum.  It's not worth risking losing the deal and ending up with John's lower offer."
