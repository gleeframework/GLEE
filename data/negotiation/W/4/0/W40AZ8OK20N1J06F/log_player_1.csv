I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a good starting point, as it's more than my minimum threshold of $12,000 and leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer or even sell to John for $12,000 depending on Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $14,500.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $14,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial $14,500, but still above Bob's offer. I hope this will incentivize him to accept and reach a deal."

I'll accept Bob's offer of $13,500. While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, this is still a good deal. It's significantly better than selling to John for $12,000 and  closer to my desired price than I thought I would be able to achieve."
