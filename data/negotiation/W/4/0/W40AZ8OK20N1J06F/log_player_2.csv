"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  There's room for negotiation as the product is worth $12,000 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Offering $13,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price and is still above the product's value to her. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but is also trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is still cheaper than John's price, Bob can potentially still get a better deal. Alice has already shown some flexibility, and Bob can continue to pressure her with counteroffers. He might be able to reach a price closer to his target of $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a compromise. He's increased his offer from $13,000, showing willingness to meet Alice halfway.  However, $13,500 is still a good saving for him compared to John's price, and it remains within the range where Alice might find it profitable to sell."
