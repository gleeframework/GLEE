"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a good price for both of us, considering the product's value to you. Let's try to find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $950,000. Would that be feasible?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's try to finalize this.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
