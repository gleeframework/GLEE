Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's ambitious:** It shows confidence in the value of the product and leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's above my minimum:**  I'm still making a profit well above my minimum acceptable value.
* **It forces Bob to reveal his hand:**  His response will tell me if he's seriously interested and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting point and below my minimum acceptable value. I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows flexibility while remaining firm on my minimum value. I hope this will encourage Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, and I've already made a counteroffer.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and I'm confident John will pay my minimum.  I'll take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
