**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is consistently coming up in price, while we're reducing our ask.  $17,000 is a reasonable profit above our minimum, and continuing to push risks him walking away. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to go with John's $15,000."
