"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This anchors the negotiation high and leaves room for strategic concessions.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" of the product without explicitly stating what it is. This vagueness allows Bob to potentially justify a higher price in his mind. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  The high starting price gives me significant room to negotiate down over the remaining rounds while still aiming for a final price well above my minimum. 
* **Alternative Option:** It's important to keep in mind I have John as a backup buyer. If negotiations with Bob stall or become unfavorable, I can walk away and still get my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. How about we come down significantly?  I'm thinking closer to  $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While it's a substantial counter-offer, accepting it would mean losing out on a significant amount of potential profit. I'm confident that through further negotiation, I can secure a better deal. I'm willing to counter-offer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understand your position. While your initial offer is quite a bit lower than I can consider, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of this product."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a significant concession from my initial price, but I am still well above both Bob's offer and my minimum price.  This demonstrates flexibility while reinforcing the product's value.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high initial offer, this counter-offer, though a significant reduction, might still seem reasonable to Bob in the context of our negotiation.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's ""true value and potential"" to subtly push back against Bob's attempt to anchor the price much lower. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** My goal is to keep the negotiation moving and find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm hopeful Bob will recognize my willingness to negotiate and respond positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but that's still significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need you to meet me closer to my range. How about we try $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but $1,200,000 is still a significant difference. I believe there's room for him to go higher. I'm willing to play hardball a little longer to see if I can push him further before considering accepting or walking away to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up on the price. I've also given this more thought, and to be transparent, I have another potential buyer.  However, I believe in being fair and giving you a chance to make this work.  My absolute bottom line is $1,650,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** I'm now setting a firm bottom line and presenting it as a final offer. This signals to Bob that I'm serious and not willing to go any lower.
* **Introducing Competition:**  By mentioning another potential buyer (John), I'm creating a sense of urgency and scarcity. This might encourage Bob to act quickly before he misses out.
* **Transparency (with a purpose):**  While I'm being somewhat transparent about my bottom line, I'm doing so strategically to bring the negotiation closer to a close. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk that Bob might walk away, but I'm calculating that the potential reward of securing a price closer to my target is worth the gamble at this stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer and your transparency. I'm still very interested in the product, but that price point is just not feasible for me.  I can go up to $1,350,000, but that's my absolute limit. It's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob has clearly stated his absolute limit is $1,350,000. While this is closer to my minimum, it's highly unlikely he'll budge significantly from this point.
* **Time Investment:** We've already spent six rounds negotiating, and while progress has been made, the remaining gap is significant enough to warrant considering my alternative.
* **Guaranteed Return:** John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is more than Bob is currently offering and avoids the risk of further failed negotiations.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob. While a deal with him could have potentially yielded more, it's not worth the additional time, effort, and risk of him walking away completely. Accepting John's offer ensures a good return on the product."
