,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. How about we come down significantly?  I'm thinking closer to  $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understand your position. While your initial offer is quite a bit lower than I can consider, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of this product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but that's still significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need you to meet me closer to my range. How about we try $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up on the price. I've also given this more thought, and to be transparent, I have another potential buyer.  However, I believe in being fair and giving you a chance to make this work.  My absolute bottom line is $1,650,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer and your transparency. I'm still very interested in the product, but that price point is just not feasible for me.  I can go up to $1,350,000, but that's my absolute limit. It's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
