Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understand your position. While your initial offer is quite a bit lower than I can consider, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up on the price. I've also given this more thought, and to be transparent, I have another potential buyer.  However, I believe in being fair and giving you a chance to make this work.  My absolute bottom line is $1,650,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by mentioning another buyer to pressure you. However, her price is still significantly higher than your upper limit. You've made good progress in bringing the price down, and you still have time and the option of John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer and your transparency. I'm still very interested in the product, but that price point is just not feasible for me.  I can go up to $1,350,000, but that's my absolute limit. It's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us."",
