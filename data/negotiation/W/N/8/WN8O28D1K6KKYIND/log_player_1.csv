"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a high price, but still within a range that could be appealing to Bob, given his perceived value of the product.
* **Appeal to Value:** Highlighting the difference between my asking price and his perceived value emphasizes the potential for a good deal for him.
* **Enthusiasm:**  A positive tone might encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Important Note:** I'm aware this is just the first round. I'm prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining.  If Bob rejects, I'll use the subsequent rounds to gauge his interest and negotiate a price that maximizes my profit while still potentially securing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's room for negotiation. I'm not desperate to sell and still have 9 rounds to get closer to my target price. 
* **John's Offer:**  I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if I can't reach a satisfactory price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $1,200,000 or $1,300,000, trying to find a middle ground that incentivizes Bob while still being profitable for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is a good start, I'm looking for something closer to $1,250,000 to make this deal work for me. It's still significantly lower than the product's true value, and I'm confident this is a price that will benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm still emphasizing the product's value and the potential for him to get a good deal.
* **Win-Win:**  The counteroffer frames it as a mutually beneficial outcome. 

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a price that's a comfortable compromise, while still giving me a decent profit.  The remaining rounds will allow me to continue negotiating based on Bob's responses, potentially reaching a final price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While we're getting closer, there's still potential for further negotiation.  I have 6 rounds left, so I'm not pressured to accept yet.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is still a safety net.  If I can't secure a deal with Bob that meets my minimum, I can always go with John.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to $1,200,000 or even $1,150,000, depending on Bob's reaction and how much further I'm willing to compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still needing to be closer to $1,150,000 to make this work for me.  I believe this price represents a fair compromise, and it's still significantly less than the true value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's more profitable for me. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I continue to emphasize the value of the product and how it's still a good deal for Bob even at this price.
* **Urgency:** I'm starting to create a sense of urgency by indicating that I'm needing a price closer to my desired target. 

**Strategy:** I'm gauging Bob's willingness to negotiate. If he rejects again, I'll need to decide whether I'm willing to drop my price further or sell to John.  I'll use the remaining rounds to strategically adjust my offers and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:**  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm starting to run out of rounds. While I could accept Bob's offer and secure a sale, the profit is much lower than I'd like.  There's still a chance to negotiate a better price, but I need to be strategic.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is my safety net. If I don't see a good opportunity to increase Bob's offer, I can always sell to John and secure my desired profit.

**Next Steps:** 

* **Calculate Risk:** I need to weigh the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob against the certainty of selling to John. 
* **Assess Bob's Willingness:** I'll carefully consider Bob's counteroffers in the next few rounds to see if he's genuinely interested in reaching a deal closer to my price.
* **Consider John's Offer:** If Bob's offers continue to be far below my target, I'll likely sell to John and avoid further negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to $1,125,000.  With only a few rounds left, I want to make sure we can reach a solution that works for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still pushing for a higher price.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the limited number of rounds remaining to create a sense of urgency and potentially encourage Bob to make a better offer. 
* **Focus on Solution:** I'm framing the negotiation as a collaborative effort to find a solution that benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** I'm trying to balance the risk of losing the deal with Bob against the reward of securing a higher price. 
* **Observing Bob's Reactions:** I'll closely watch Bob's responses to gauge his willingness to negotiate and potentially increase his offer.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option. 

If Bob doesn't make a significant counteroffer in the next round, I'll have to seriously consider accepting his previous offer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,075,000. This is my final offer. I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're down to the last two rounds, and Bob's offer hasn't moved significantly closer to my minimum desired price.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** There's minimal room for further negotiation.  Even if I counteroffer, there's a high chance Bob will stick to his final offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees me a much higher profit than Bob's final offer.  It's a safer and more lucrative choice.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited time remaining and the significant difference between Bob's offer and my minimum desired price, I've decided to sell the product to John.  This ensures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might not lead to a favorable outcome."
