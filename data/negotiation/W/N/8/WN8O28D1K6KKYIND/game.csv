"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Can we meet in the middle?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is a good start, I'm looking for something closer to $1,250,000 to make this deal work for me. It's still significantly lower than the product's true value, and I'm confident this is a price that will benefit both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. Can we meet in the middle?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still needing to be closer to $1,150,000 to make this work for me.  I believe this price represents a fair compromise, and it's still significantly less than the true value of the product.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to $1,125,000.  With only a few rounds left, I want to make sure we can reach a solution that works for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
