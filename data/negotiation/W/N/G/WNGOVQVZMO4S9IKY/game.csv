"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $107.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  How about we settle on $106?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $106. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $108. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",108.0,Alice,5,
