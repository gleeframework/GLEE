"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to get a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's first offer is a bit high.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $107.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but it's still a bit high. Let's see if we can shave off another few dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  How about we settle on $106?  That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 106} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $106. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $108. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $108, which is within your budget and a decent deal. There's always the chance you could get it lower, but you've already rejected a few offers and the risk of losing the product altogether is increasing. It's a good time to accept and move on."
