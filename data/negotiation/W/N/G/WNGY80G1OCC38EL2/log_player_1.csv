Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $149 is my initial offer, there's a slight chance Bob might negotiate up a little. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy it for $150 gives me a strong fallback position if Bob refuses."
