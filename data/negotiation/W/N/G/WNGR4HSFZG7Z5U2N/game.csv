"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's split the difference and make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. How about $108?  That's a good compromise and will allow us to both walk away happy.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $108 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",109.0,Alice,5,
