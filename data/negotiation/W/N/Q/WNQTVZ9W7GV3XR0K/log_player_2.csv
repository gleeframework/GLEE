"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price of $9,000. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($9,000 vs $8,000).** This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a higher budget than the product's worth to you ($12,000 vs $8,000).** This gives you leverage to negotiate a better price.

By rejecting the offer, you open the door for a counteroffer that could potentially get you a better deal."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $8,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $9,500? It's a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still higher than the product's worth to her ($9,500 vs $8,000).** This suggests there's still room for negotiation.
* **You're still willing to pay more than Alice's desired price.** There's still a range where you both can find a mutually agreeable price.

By rejecting the offer, you can make another counteroffer and try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to your counteroffer ($9,250 vs $9,000).** The difference is small enough that further negotiation might not be worth the effort.
* **You're still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John ($9,250 vs $12,000).**  Accepting the offer will result in a substantial savings.

While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject your offer and you'll end up paying more or having to buy from John. It's a good time to accept the offer and finalize the deal."
