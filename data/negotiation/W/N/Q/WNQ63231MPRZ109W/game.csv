"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $8500 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $8750? It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try one more time to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to drop my price to $9000.  It's a fair compromise that gives you a great deal on the product while allowing me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
