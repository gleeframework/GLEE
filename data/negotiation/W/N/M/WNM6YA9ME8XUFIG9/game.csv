"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know is extremely valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1200000. This reflects its high quality and the benefits it will bring to your business. Let's discuss!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm proposing $1000000. This still leaves a significant margin for you, and I'm confident this product will be a great investment for your business.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial counteroffer. How about $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but $950000 is still too low.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle on $975000?  This would allow us both to achieve a good outcome.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous counteroffer. How about $925000?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's see if we can finally close this deal. I'm going to make one final counteroffer: $950000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this mutually beneficial transaction. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and bring you significant returns. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous counteroffer. How about $915000?",915000.0,Bob,8,
