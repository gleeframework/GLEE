Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know is extremely valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This reflects its high quality and the benefits it will bring to your business. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $900,000, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a bit longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm proposing $1,000,000. This still leaves a significant margin for you, and I'm confident this product will be a great investment for your business."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial counteroffer. How about $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good offer, I'm going to stick with my counteroffer.  I'm still confident I can close the deal with Bob at a higher price.  He's clearly interested and I believe a few more rounds of negotiation could get us to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but $950,000 is still too low.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle on $975,000?  This would allow us both to achieve a good outcome.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous counteroffer. How about $925000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  We are getting closer to an agreement, but $925,000 is still too low.  I'm determined to get a price closer to my goal of $1,000,000.  With a few more rounds, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's see if we can finally close this deal. I'm going to make one final counteroffer: $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this mutually beneficial transaction. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and bring you significant returns. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous counteroffer. How about $915000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting frustrating.  I've tried my best to negotiate with Bob, but we're not close to an agreement.  It's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer. I'm better off selling to John for $800,000 than continuing this negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
