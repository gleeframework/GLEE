{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

$60 is a good price, but I want to see if I can get it lower. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's about 25% lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it's still within a reasonable range that Alice might consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $55 is a tempting price, I'm still hoping to get it lower. I've already successfully lowered the price by $5, and I have 7 rounds remaining. I believe I can push for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise.  $50 is a reasonable middle ground, and I believe it's a price Alice might be willing to accept, especially with the time pressure of the limited rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $58. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $58
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come back up to a price that's closer to her initial offer, but it's still a good deal for me. I've already saved $4 from her original price, and with only 5 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from her and potentially end up paying more to John.  $58 is a good compromise, and I'm confident I can get it for less if I were to continue the negotiation."
