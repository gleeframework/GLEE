"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $10000 is my minimum, I'm confident the product's value justifies a slightly higher price.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This gives you a good deal and allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $11000. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my own costs. Let's try to finalize this deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
