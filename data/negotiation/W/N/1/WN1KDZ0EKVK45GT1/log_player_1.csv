Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than my minimum price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also reflects the fact that the product is worth more to Bob, giving him an incentive to accept. I will continue to monitor the negotiation and adjust my offers based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I think the product is worth, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I hope this will be enough to convince him to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is still significantly higher than what I could get from John.  To ensure a sale and secure a profit, I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
