"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's a good starting point for negotiation, Bob should aim to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest in selling the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which still represents a significant value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This allows me to recognize your interest while still reflecting the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still above Bob's desired price.  Bob should continue negotiating to get closer to his target of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to pay $950,000 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our valuations remains significant.  I'm open to finding a compromise but need to see movement on your end. My final offer is $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
