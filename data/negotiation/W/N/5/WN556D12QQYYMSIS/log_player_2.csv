"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's valuation,  it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to make a deal at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $950,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get an even lower price. It's worth noting that buying from John for $1,000,000 is always a viable option, so Bob is not taking a huge risk by rejecting Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it's closer to the price I'm willing to pay. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and it's still a significant discount from my original price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to yield a lower price, as she has already shown a reluctance to go below $1,000,000.  Buying the product from John for $1,000,000 ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
