"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to make a deal at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $950,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it's closer to the price I'm willing to pay. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and it's still a significant discount from my original price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
