Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is significantly lower than my minimum ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for Bob to benefit from a price lower than his perceived value ($800,000). 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  Creating a sense of scarcity and urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly."
