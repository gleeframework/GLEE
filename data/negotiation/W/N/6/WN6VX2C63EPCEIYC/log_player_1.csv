"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $80. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $130 is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum price of $150 but leaves room for negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give the product away at such a low price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $112.5 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  It's better to continue negotiating rather than selling to John for $150 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $115. How about we meet at $113.50?  I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 113.5}

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds remaining and Bob's offer still below my minimum price, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150.  While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially resulting in a lower price or a failed deal outweighs the potential benefit of a few extra dollars. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and a quicker outcome."
