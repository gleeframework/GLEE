"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are only willing to pay $15,000 maximum and Alice is offering the product at $15,000, there is no room for negotiation. It's better to buy from John for the same price as Alice's offer, eliminating the risk of a longer negotiation and potential higher cost."
