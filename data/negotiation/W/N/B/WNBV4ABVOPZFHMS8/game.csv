"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $887,500?",887500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $887,500 is still too low. How about we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above your target price. I'd be willing to meet you at $850,000. That's my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",850000.0,Bob,4,
