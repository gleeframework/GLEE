"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $10000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth much more to you.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. It's still a good price for me, and I'm willing to make a deal.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? It's still a great deal for you considering the value you place on this product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $8500 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7250 is still a little lower than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's aim for a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $8000, which is still a great value for you given the product's worth to you. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $8000. I'm willing to go up to $7500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",7500.0,Bob,6,
