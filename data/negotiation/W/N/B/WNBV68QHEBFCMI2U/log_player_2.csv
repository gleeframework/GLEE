Explanation:
Alice is offering the product for $1,150,000. While this is less than John's price of $1,200,000, it's still above Alice's valuation of the product ($1,000,000). This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, Bob might be able to get her to lower the price further.
