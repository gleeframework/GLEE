"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as much as possible. I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I need to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm going to reduce my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit. I believe $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to settle for that amount yet. I'll try to get a better price with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm lowering the price again, but I'm not willing to go lower than $1,250,000. I'm hoping that this offer will be more appealing to Bob and we can finally reach an agreement."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk getting a lower price in the future.  I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,200,000."
