Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 aims to maximize your profit while still staying below Bob's valuation. This gives him a good deal while also earning you significantly more than your minimum. 

This strategy balances your desire for the best price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
