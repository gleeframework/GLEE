# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something I value at least $12,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to miss. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.
