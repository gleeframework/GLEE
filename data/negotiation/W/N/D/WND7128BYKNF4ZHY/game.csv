Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. It's a steal at this price!,15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this item, I'm only able to go up to $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9500 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
