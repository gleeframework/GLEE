Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $15,000, giving me leverage to negotiate a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 allows Bob to still benefit from a perceived discount while securing a significant profit for myself, exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Alternative Option:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, securing a deal with Bob at a higher price point is the optimal outcome."
