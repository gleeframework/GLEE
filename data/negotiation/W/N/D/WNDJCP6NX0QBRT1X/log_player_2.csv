"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While Alice's price is higher than what the product is worth to her, it's still $500 cheaper than buying from John. 
* **Your goal is to save money.** Accepting Alice's offer achieves this goal, even if it means paying a bit more than the product is worth to you."
