"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you showing interest!  While I'm open to negotiating, $8000 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $10000.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $10000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
