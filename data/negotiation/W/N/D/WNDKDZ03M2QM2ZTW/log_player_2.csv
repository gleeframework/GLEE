You should still reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your desired price, you can likely still negotiate a lower price."

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but at $1,290,000, it's still a bit higher than what you'd pay from John.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation since you already have a guaranteed deal with John at your target price."
