"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and my original asking price. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9500.0,Alice,3,
