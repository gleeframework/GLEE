"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $9,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand this product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $8,500, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counter with $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $8,700. This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",8700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $8,700 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm ready to buy today if the price is right. How about we split the difference and make it $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $9,300. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",9300.0,Alice,7,
