"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a limited time at the special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is a lower price than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within a reasonable range. This shows that Bob is serious about negotiating, but also that he's willing to pay a fair price.  This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate while still keeping Bob within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $100 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. While it's closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about we settle on $90? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by making a counteroffer closer to Alice's last offer. $90 is still within Bob's budget, but it's closer to Alice's desired price. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $90 is close, but I need to get at least $95 for it to make sense for me.  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $95 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, Bob has already gone through several rounds and it's unlikely Alice will go lower. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $80 and save himself further negotiation and potential risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice."
