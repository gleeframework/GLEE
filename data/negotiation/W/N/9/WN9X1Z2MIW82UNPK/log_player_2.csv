The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she is offering it for $130. You can likely get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on $120 for the product? I believe this strikes a balance between value and affordability.

Alice has lowered her price to $120, which is within your budget and a good deal for you.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might reject your counteroffer and you'd have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer is the most practical choice."
