Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of $100, but still gives him a discount compared to John's offer of $120. This strategy maximizes the chance of Bob accepting the offer while still earning more than your minimum acceptable price of $120."
