"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I see the value in this product, $11,000 is a bit outside my range.  I'm happy to offer $10,500, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a deal at $11,200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $11,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to offer $10,750, which is closer to my budget and still a good value for the product. I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,050. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd consider.",11050.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,050 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer $10,900.  I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price that works for both of us.",10900.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $10,975. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd consider.",10975.0,Alice,7,
