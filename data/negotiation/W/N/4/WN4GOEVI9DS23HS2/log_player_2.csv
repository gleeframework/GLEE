Bob should reject the offer.  He is willing to pay up to $12,000 and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $10,000, so there's room for negotiation."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a deal at $11,200.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,050. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,050

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,050 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer $10,900.  I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10900}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $10,975. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,975. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,975

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept this offer. He's already at the top of his budget, and while he could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will walk away.  $10,975 is a good deal for him, and it's likely the best he'll get."
