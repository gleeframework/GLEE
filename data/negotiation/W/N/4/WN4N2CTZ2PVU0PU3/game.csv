Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. What do you think?,15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $8000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $12500. How about we meet in the middle at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10000. I'm willing to make a new counteroffer of $11750. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. How about we try $9500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to get the price down, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9500. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $11000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000. How about $10250?",10250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your frustration, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10250. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $11250. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've made several concessions and I'm starting to think that I should just walk away. I'm willing to make one last offer of $10000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",10000.0,Bob,10,
