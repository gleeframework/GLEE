,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is simply too low for me. How about $90? That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and settle at $90. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",90.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're still not willing to go below $90, but I'm trying to stretch my budget as far as I can. How about we meet at $82.50?",82.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $82.50 is still below what I can realistically accept. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be at least at $87.50. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",87.5,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. How about we meet at $84?",84.0,Bob,8,
