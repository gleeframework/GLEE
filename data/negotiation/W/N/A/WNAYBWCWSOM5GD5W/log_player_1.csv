It's getting late in the game, and Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum.  With only two rounds left, I don't have much room to negotiate.  To avoid risking getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with, I'm going to take John's offer of $12,000. While it's my minimum, it's a guaranteed sale and secures a decent profit."
