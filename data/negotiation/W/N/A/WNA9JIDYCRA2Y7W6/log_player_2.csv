# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is above your maximum budget of $80.  It's best to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $85? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to $100.  How about $95?  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still above your budget, but closer to your maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget.  How about $90? I'm confident this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? I'm really hoping to make this deal work, but I can't go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is stuck at $95, and you've already made a counteroffer of $90.  It seems unlikely that you'll be able to get her any lower. Since John is offering the product for $80, it's better to take his offer and avoid further negotiation. You'll save $15 compared to Alice's price."
