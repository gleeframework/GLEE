,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While your offer is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $15,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.  Let's make this deal happen!",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $15,000. How about $14,200? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's closer to what I'm willing to pay.",14200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However, $14,200 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,600. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",14600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go up to $14,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $14,200, which would be $14,300. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14300.0,Bob,6,
