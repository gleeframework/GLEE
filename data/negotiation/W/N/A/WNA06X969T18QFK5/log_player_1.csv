{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $16,500. This is a great deal, considering the value you've placed on it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 16500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above the minimum value Bob has for the product. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter and work towards a mutually agreeable price.  However, I'll always have the option to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept and get the sale done, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  If he still won't budge, I'll always have the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While your offer is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $15,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $15,000. How about $14,200? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's closer to what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'll counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach an agreement. If he rejects again, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However, $14,200 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,600. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 14600}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go up to $14,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $14,200, which would be $14,300. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While it's tempting to accept and get the sale done, I'm not comfortable with that price. I'll sell the product to John for $15,000 to guarantee that I get at least my minimum value."
