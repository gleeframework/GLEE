"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is $3,000 more than your maximum price and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation, and it's unlikely Alice wants to lose the sale entirely. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal to Alice that you're a serious buyer but also price-conscious."
