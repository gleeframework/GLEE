Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth $100, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  $100 is higher than $80, so Bob has some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is still above your minimum of $120, so you're not losing money right away.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space to go up or down in price depending on how the negotiation goes. 

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a better price without immediately alienating him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think the product is a great deal, but I was hoping to get it for a bit lower. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $120. I'm not willing to settle for less, especially since I have another buyer willing to pay my minimum. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can keep the negotiation going and potentially get a better price. It also sends a signal that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

This counteroffer is strategically designed to:

* **Maintain momentum:** By quickly countering Bob's offer, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate.
* **Be reasonable:** $95 is a compromise, showing good faith and a willingness to meet in the middle. 
* **Stay above your minimum:** You're still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you don't lose money on the deal.

This counteroffer should hopefully encourage Bob to reconsider and potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, his offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely that I'll be able to get him to agree to a price closer to my desired value. 

Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I meet my minimum financial goal and avoids further time and effort in negotiating with Bob."
