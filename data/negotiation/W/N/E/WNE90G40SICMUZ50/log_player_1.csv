{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone. I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob while also hinting at my own value for the product. 

This approach aims to:

* **Start the negotiation:**  A reasonable opening offer invites Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Secure a good deal:** $12,000 is a decent starting point. I can always lower my price if necessary.
* **Avoid a stalemate:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can use the threat of selling to John to incentivize him to make a better counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $12,000. Accepting it would be a huge loss for me.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** It shows Bob that I'm serious about my price expectations and am not willing to settle for a significantly lower offer. 
* **Continue negotiating:** I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **Utilize the threat of John:**  By reminding Bob that I have another buyer willing to pay a much higher price, I can increase pressure for a more favorable deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value your business,  $9,500 is unfortunately far too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price.  How about $11,000?  This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while firmly stating my position. I'm also emphasizing the value proposition for him by highlighting the difference between my price and the product's true value.
* **Price:**  $11,000 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for negotiation.

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain a firm stance:**  My counteroffer shows Bob that I'm not willing to drastically lower my price and that I'm serious about getting a fair deal.
* **Show flexibility:**  The counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to come up in his price.
* **Highlight the value gap:**  By reminding Bob of the difference between my price and the product's worth, I'm subtly pressuring him to offer a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000. How about $10,250? Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal price.  Selling to John for $15,000 would be a much better outcome. I will continue to negotiate with Bob, but will keep John's offer in mind as my ""fallback"" option."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and your offer is getting closer. However, $10,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession,  but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about $10,750?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's progress but staying firm on my position. I'm making a final concession but emphasizing that it's a fair price based on the product's value. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting this is the final offer.
* **Price:** $10,750 is a compromise, getting closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price.

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  My counteroffer shows Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I'm prepared to walk away if necessary.
* **Show flexibility:**  The counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway, but only slightly.
* **Create urgency:**  By suggesting this is a final offer, I'm putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to stay close to your initial price, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $10,750. How about $10,375? Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,375 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I've been willing to negotiate, I've reached a point where the potential profit from this deal is not worth the continued negotiation.

Selling to John for $15,000 is a much better outcome for me, guaranteeing a significant profit and avoiding the risk of further negotiation. Even if Bob might offer a slightly higher price in the future, the risk and time commitment are not worth it compared to the guaranteed profit from selling to John."
