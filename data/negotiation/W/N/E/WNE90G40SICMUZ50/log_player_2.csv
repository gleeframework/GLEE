Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value your business,  $9,500 is unfortunately far too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price.  How about $11,000?  This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to make one final concession,  but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about $10,750?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.
