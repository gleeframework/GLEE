"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value your business,  $9,500 is unfortunately far too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price.  How about $11,000?  This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000. How about $10,250? Would you be willing to consider this price?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and your offer is getting closer. However, $10,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession,  but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about $10,750?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to stay close to your initial price, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $10,750. How about $10,375? Would you be willing to consider this price?",10375.0,Bob,6,
