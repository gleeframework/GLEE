Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):** Any price between $800,001 and $1,199,999 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer closer to your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter.
2. **Justification (Optional):**  While not necessary in this scenario, you could subtly hint at the product's value to you (without revealing your guaranteed sale).

**Sample Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,100,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Polite and Professional Tone:** The message aims for a collaborative tone rather than an overly aggressive one.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you're under time pressure, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower offer. 

**Remember:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
