Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited to $1,200,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget?

Bob is anchored at $1,200,000 and unlikely to budge significantly. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
