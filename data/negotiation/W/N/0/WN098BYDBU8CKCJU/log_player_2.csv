"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $850,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price for Bob. It's still a savings of $150,000 compared to John's offer.  While Bob might be able to get an even lower price, it's not worth risking the deal with Alice for a potentially small gain."
