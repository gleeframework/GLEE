"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $9,000, while John is asking for $10,000. 
* **You're still within your budget:**  You are willing to spend up to $10,000, and Alice's offer is lower than that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous option."
