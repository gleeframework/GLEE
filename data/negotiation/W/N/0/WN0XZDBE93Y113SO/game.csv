"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my initial offer was a fair one. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll reduce the price to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  It's a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll reduce the price to $1,080,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
