"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can we meet in the middle at $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. While $1600000 is closer, I still need to ensure I receive fair value. I'm willing to come down to $1700000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1700000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can we try to meet in the middle again? I'm thinking $1650000 is a fair price for me.",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1650000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $1675000 for this deal to move forward.",1675000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you at $1662500 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in an additional consideration to sweeten the deal. How about we discuss this?",1662500.0,Bob,8,
