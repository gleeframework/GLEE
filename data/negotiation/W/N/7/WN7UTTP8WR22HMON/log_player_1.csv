Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $1,200,000. Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now offering the same amount as our safety net (John).  While there might be a slight chance of getting Bob a bit higher, it's risky. Accepting John's offer guarantees our minimum acceptable profit."
