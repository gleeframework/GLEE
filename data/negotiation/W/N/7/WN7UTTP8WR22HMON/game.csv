"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $1,200,000. Would that be feasible?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
