"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it and your own asking price. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $15,000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
