Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, you're still only 5 rounds away from being able to purchase from John for $1,000,000.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further with Alice to reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,065,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,060,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,062,500.  Let's see if we can find that middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1062500}

Round 7
Alice's offer:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to what you're willing to pay, you have the opportunity to buy from John for a lower price. There are only 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate Alice down to your target price.  It's time to take the safe route and buy from John."
