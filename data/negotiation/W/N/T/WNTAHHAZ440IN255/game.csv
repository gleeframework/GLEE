"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,000,000 represents the high-end value I see, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this price reflects a more reasonable middle ground while still recognizing the unique benefits the product offers. What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my financial constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
