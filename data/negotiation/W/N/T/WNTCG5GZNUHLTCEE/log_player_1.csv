{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my desired price, or if he's looking for a bigger discount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I believe I can still get a bit more. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
