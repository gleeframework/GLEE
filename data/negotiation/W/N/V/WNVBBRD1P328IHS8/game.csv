"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I like where you're going, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500 just yet. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $10,750? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product.",10750.0,Alice,5,
