"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you at a price of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is still a bit above my target.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $825,000?  This would be a good compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
