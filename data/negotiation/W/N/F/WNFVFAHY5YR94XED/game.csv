"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I agree this product would be valuable to my business, but I believe $1,300,000 is a little high.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,225,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $1,300,000.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $1,225,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,180,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $1,300,000.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
