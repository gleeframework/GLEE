Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and potentially lets you secure a higher profit than your minimum acceptable price ($10,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** Offering a price significantly above $10,000 might signal to Bob that the product is of high value, potentially making him more inclined to accept a price higher than $10,000."
