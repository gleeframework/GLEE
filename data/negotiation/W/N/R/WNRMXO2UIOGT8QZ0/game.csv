"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is a significant discount from my original price.  This is still a good value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9500 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to make one last offer of $10500. This is my final price, and it reflects the true value of the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10500.0,Alice,5,
