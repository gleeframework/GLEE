"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1200000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, which is a significant amount for a product of this caliber.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While we appreciate your willingness to negotiate, we're not willing to go as low as $1000000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1100000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $1050000?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to compromise, but we're not willing to go as low as $1050000. We're willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1075000.
