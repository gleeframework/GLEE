"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I'm confident it will be a great asset for your business. My starting price is $1,750,000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,750,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,750,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1,600,000 to make this work.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still too high for Bob. While it's closer to his ideal price, it's still above his budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and attempt to get a lower price. It's worth noting that he's already received a counteroffer from Alice, indicating that she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still too far from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,450,000.  This would allow us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's try to close the gap and find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. He has several rounds left and should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price.  He can also consider the possibility of buying from John if he believes he won't be able to secure a better deal with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close, but $1,350,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm prepared to pay $1,375,000, which is a good price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
