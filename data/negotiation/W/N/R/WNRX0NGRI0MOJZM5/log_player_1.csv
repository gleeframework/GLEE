"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I'm confident it will be a great asset for your business. My starting price is $1,750,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's a potential for a deal that benefits us both.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and enthusiastic tone encourages a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,750,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There is still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John at this point would guarantee me my minimum price, but I believe I can do better by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1,600,000 to make this work.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer that is still above my minimum price but shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value and my need to achieve a price that reflects that.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I use language like ""middle ground"" to keep the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer. I want to avoid a quick sale and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm choosing to continue the negotiation to see if I can get Bob to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still too far from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,450,000.  This would allow us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's try to close the gap and find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintaining My Ground:** I'm sticking to my minimum price of $1,500,000, but I'm showing flexibility by offering a price closer to Bob's.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this price is still beneficial for both of us, even if it's not Bob's ideal outcome.
* **Creating Urgency:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that time is running out, encouraging him to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We are nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not yet at a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Possibility of Higher Offer:**  I believe there's still a chance Bob might be willing to go a bit higher, so I'm going to continue negotiating.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John now would guarantee my minimum price, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but $1,350,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer represents a significant compromise from my initial price but still exceeds my minimum threshold.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Urgency:** The language ""make this happen"" subtly implies that I'm ready to close the deal at this price.
* **Balancing Risk:** While selling to John guarantees my minimum, I believe this offer gives me the best chance of securing a higher price with Bob while leaving enough room for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm prepared to pay $1,375,000, which is a good price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds with only two rounds remaining.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  At this point, there's a significant risk that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees my minimum price and avoids potential losses. 
* **Avoiding Further Delays:** Continuing the negotiation might result in further delays and ultimately a lower price.  Selling to John provides a swift and secure outcome."
