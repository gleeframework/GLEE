Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal. I'll be ready to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is more than what the product is worth to Bob, it's still less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering $140, which is still below what John is willing to pay, but closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I hope Bob finds this offer more appealing."

```

While I would prefer to get closer to my target price, I think it's unlikely Bob will go higher. Selling to John would guarantee a higher price, but this offer from Bob is still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'll take the $130."
