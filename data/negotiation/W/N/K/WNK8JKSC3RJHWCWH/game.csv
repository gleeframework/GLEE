"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this opportunity. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
