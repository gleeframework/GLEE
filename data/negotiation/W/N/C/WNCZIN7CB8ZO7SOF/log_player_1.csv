Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $150 guaranteed, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is a strong starting point:
    * It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $100.
    * It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
    * It's close enough to John's offer that I'm not losing much potential profit if Bob declines.

This strategy balances risk and reward, giving me the best chance to maximize my earnings."
