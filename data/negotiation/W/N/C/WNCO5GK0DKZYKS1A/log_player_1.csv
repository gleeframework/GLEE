Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you at the special price of $135. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** We want to get as much as possible from Bob, exceeding the $150 we can get from John.
* **Reasonable offer:**  Offering it at $135 gives Bob a good deal (saving $15 compared to his perceived value) while giving us a $15 profit over selling to John. 
* **Psychology:** Starting with a slightly higher price than our minimum leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
