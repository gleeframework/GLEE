"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $1400000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it.  This is my best offer.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, and I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1300000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1275000. This is very close to my maximum budget, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1275000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $1290000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1290000.0,Alice,5,
