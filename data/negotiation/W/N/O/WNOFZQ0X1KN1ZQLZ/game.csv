"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a more competitive price, but still reflects the product's worth to you. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice.  While the product is valuable, $1,100,000 is still a little steep for me. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being more competitive than my initial offer. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
