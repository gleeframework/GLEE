"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise again, so I'll counteroffer at $1,020,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm hoping we can find some middle ground. How about $980,000? This is a significant investment for me, and I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $980,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll counteroffer at $1,015,000. This is the closest I can get to meeting you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this negotiation has been a great example of trying to find middle ground!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise and I'm also willing to move a little bit.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'll make one final counteroffer at $1,005,000. This is as close to $1,000,000 as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1005000.0,Alice,9,
