{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price.  I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit higher than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,600,000? This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both room to negotiate.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,600,000 is still above my budget. While it's a slight decrease, it's still not a good deal for me.  I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering we both have room to profit. Let's try to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,450,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this time.
