"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit higher than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his stated value of $1,000,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,600,000? This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both room to negotiate.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering we both have room to profit. Let's try to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet, especially considering I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,450,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this time."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering the value we both place on it. If we can agree on this, we can close the deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already had 5 rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it's clear we are not close to agreeing on a price.  Given that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, it's in my best interest to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
