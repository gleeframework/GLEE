"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree this product has potential, $900,000 is a bit steep for me starting out.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?  I think that would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $850,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. How about $750,000?  That feels like a good compromise where we both benefit."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good compromise, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer a price of $825,000. This is a compromise that I think benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate with me. I can tell we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us. How about we settle at $780,000? I'm hoping this demonstrates my seriousness about purchasing while still being mindful of my budget."", ""product_price"": 780000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm still not comfortable going as low as $780,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $815,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue to negotiate, Alice has stated this is her lowest price.  The difference between $815,000 and our desired price is getting smaller. It's unlikely we'll achieve a significantly better outcome in the remaining rounds, and we risk Alice holding firm. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable discount."
