"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree this product has potential, $900,000 is a bit steep for me starting out.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?  I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $850,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. How about $750,000?  That feels like a good compromise where we both benefit.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good compromise, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer a price of $825,000. This is a compromise that I think benefits both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate with me. I can tell we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us. How about we settle at $780,000? I'm hoping this demonstrates my seriousness about purchasing while still being mindful of my budget.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm still not comfortable going as low as $780,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $815,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it a fair compromise. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,7,
