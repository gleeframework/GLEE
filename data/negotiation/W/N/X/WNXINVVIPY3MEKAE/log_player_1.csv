{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Knowing the product is worth $12,000 to Bob gives you a baseline.  Offering it at $15,000 aims to capture some of that perceived value. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so you're not desperate. This allows you to be more confident in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You might consider lowering your price slightly, but don't go below your $12,000 minimum."
