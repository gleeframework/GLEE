Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $13,500 and John offers the product for $12,000.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John."
