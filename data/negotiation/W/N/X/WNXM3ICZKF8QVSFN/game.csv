"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
