"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit your business. Given its value and the impact it can have on your operations, I propose a price of $12,500 for the product. This price reflects not only its worth but also the unique opportunities it presents for your company. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and needs, and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her $10,000 valuation. If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000."
