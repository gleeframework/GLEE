Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 as a starting point.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,425,000.  This offer is within my budget and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful you'll accept it.

While I could push for more, Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we're getting close to my ideal range. Accepting at $1,425,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the deal by pushing too hard."
