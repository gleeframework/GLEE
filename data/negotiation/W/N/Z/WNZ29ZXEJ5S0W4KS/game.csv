"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm happy to kick off our conversation. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 as a starting point.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,250,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line.  To be fair to us both, how about we meet in the middle at $1,525,000?",1525000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,525,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  To show some flexibility on my end, I can come down slightly to $1,475,000. I believe this is a competitive price that reflects the true value of this product.",1475000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,425,000.  This offer is within my budget and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful you'll accept it.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
