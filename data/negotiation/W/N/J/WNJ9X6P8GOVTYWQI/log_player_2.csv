"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $20000. This is a fair price considering its unique features and potential benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10000 is significantly lower than what I need to cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $17500. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit and is a fair reflection of the product's value. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,500 is still higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $13000 is still quite a bit below my minimum requirement. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15000. This is a fair price that considers both our interests.  If you're not able to go higher, I'll need to consider my other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll be able to reach a price I'm comfortable with.  It's more efficient to buy from John at this point, as I know his price is within my budget."
