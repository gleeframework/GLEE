"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle of our two offers at $1,050,000?  This reflects the value this product brings while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my new offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
