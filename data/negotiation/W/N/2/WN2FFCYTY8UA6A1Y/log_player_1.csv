``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price that's closer to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your desired selling price and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm not comfortable selling for that price yet. There's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
