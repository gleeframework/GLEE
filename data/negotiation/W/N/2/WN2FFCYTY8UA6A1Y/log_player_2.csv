"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your desired selling price and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant improvement from her previous offer and is now within Bob's budget. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will either reject further counteroffers or become unwilling to continue. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price lower than John's while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
