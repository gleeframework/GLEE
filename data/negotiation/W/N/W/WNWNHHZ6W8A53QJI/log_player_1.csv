"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable margin for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum price as possible, but I'm also leaving room for potential compromise if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $145 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction. I'll counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
I'm counteroffering at $130, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to ensure I get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum price than Bob's previous offer, it's still not acceptable. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. How about we split the difference and go with $125? That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering at $125, which is still above my minimum price but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable compromise that leads to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go up slightly to $118, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm not sure if he'll budge further, but I'm willing to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but I'm still a bit away from mine.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $121.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 121}
```

I'm counteroffering at $121, which is the midpoint between Bob's offer of $118 and my previous offer of $125. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to accept."
