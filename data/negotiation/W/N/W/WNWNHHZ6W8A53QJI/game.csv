"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",130.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. How about we split the difference and go with $125? That would be a good compromise for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go up slightly to $118, but that's my absolute limit.",118.0,Bob,6,
