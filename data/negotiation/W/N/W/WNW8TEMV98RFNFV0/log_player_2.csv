While Alice's counteroffer is better, I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

While I'd love to get it for closer to $800,000, $980,000 is still a good deal compared to the $1,200,000 Alice originally wanted. It's also only slightly more than what John is selling it for.  I'll accept Alice's offer."
