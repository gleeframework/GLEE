"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a competitive price, and I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $900000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you still get a solid return.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $850000? This would still be a great deal for you, given the value of the product, and would allow me to get a reasonable price for my investment. ",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825000. This would allow both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
