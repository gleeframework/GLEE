Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $900000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you still get a solid return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
