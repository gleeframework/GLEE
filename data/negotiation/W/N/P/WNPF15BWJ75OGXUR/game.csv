"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $12000. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'll meet you at $11500. This is the closest I can get to your desired price while still getting a fair deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
