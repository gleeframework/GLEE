"I appreciate your response, Bob. Considering the value of the product, I'd like to propose a price of $115. This is a bit higher than my initial offer, but still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $115 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $105.  Let's see if we can close the deal here.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for standing firm on your offer, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To further explore a potential agreement, I would like to suggest a price of $110. This is slightly above your last offer, yet still below my initial valuation. I believe this could be a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",107.5,Bob,6,
