Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $10,000.  Would you be interested in buying it at that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  A $10,000 price gives me room to negotiate down if Bob rejects the initial offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is too low to accept.  I need to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:** Having John as a backup option gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating without risking losing too much money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering $9,000, which is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $7,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, so I'm not risking selling the product for less than it's worth to me.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** My message emphasizes that $9,000 is a fair price for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $6,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Limited Negotiating Room:**  While there is still some room for negotiation, the gap between our desired prices is substantial, and further negotiation might not yield a satisfactory outcome.
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me the best possible outcome and minimizes the risk of ending up with a sale far below my minimum acceptable price. 

At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob don't outweigh the risk of a protracted negotiation that might not result in a favorable outcome.  Selling to John is the most reliable way to ensure I achieve my goal of earning as much money as possible for the product."
