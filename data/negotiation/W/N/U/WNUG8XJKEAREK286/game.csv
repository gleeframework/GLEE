"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me as well.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a significant advantage, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $900,000. How about we try $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but I can't go any lower than $890,000.  This price still gives you a substantial return on your investment, and it's a fair compromise considering my value for the product. What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $890,000. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but no higher. Can we meet in the middle at $885,000?",885000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try to reach a final agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $882,500.  This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",882500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000, but no higher. Can you reconsider and meet me at that price?",880000.0,Bob,8,
