"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening move, and I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate down from there.  It's important to remember that I have the safety net of selling to John for $800,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I believe I can still do better. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer and my first offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to accept it. This ensures I get the value I need from the sale while avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potential loss."
