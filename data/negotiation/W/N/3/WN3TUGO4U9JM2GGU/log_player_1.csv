Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. How about a price of $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with an offer of $110 aims to capture the majority of the value Bob places on the product ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate down a bit, potentially reaching a price that's still very profitable for you.
* **Safeguard Against Loss:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob. 

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming for the best possible outcome while ensuring you don't lose out on the sale entirely."
