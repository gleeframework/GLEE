"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $150 to you, so you can afford to pay a bit more than Alice's asking price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $115 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob.  I could come down to $125, but I can't go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $125. This is a good deal, and it's better than buying it from John for $150."
