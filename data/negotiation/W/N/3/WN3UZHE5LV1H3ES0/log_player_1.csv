"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good price while still leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to start high, but not too high that it immediately turns Bob off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $115 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about $110? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to get a better price. How about $108?  That's closer to my budget and closer to your asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $108 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for another round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $110?  It's a fair price, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
