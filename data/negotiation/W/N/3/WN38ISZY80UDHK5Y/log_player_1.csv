{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring I make more than my minimum.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate as he values the product at $12,000. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own. If the negotiations stall, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $13000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12,250. It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $11875? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my preferred range. I want to see if I can get closer to $12,000 before settling. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
