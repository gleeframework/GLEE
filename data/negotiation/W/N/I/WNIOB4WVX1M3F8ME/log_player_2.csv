Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $110 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $115? It's a fair price for both of us.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get the price even lower. Here's my counteroffer:
