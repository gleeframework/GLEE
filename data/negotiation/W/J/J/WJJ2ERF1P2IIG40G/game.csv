"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $80, I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a significant discount and still allows me to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $95, which would make this a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",95.0,Bob,6,
