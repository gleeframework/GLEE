"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $700,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering its value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice.  While $700,000 is closer, it's still a significant jump for me. Could you do $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $650,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you.",650000.0,Alice,5,
