I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,300,000. This leaves some room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Since Bob values the product at the same amount, he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm counter-offering at $1,250,000. This is still a decent profit for me and might be more appealing to Bob than his initial offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also have a firm price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm not comfortable accepting an offer that's below my minimum. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to him."
