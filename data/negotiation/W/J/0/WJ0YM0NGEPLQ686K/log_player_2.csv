"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $850,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits both of us."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, aiming to test her willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $850,000, I'm aiming for a price significantly lower than both Alice's asking price and John's backup offer. 
* **Open for Negotiation:**  The message keeps the tone collaborative, indicating I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
