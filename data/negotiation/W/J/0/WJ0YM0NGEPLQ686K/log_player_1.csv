Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and presents the offer as a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond and negotiate, showing flexibility.
* **Backup plan:** I have John as a backup buyer, giving me the confidence to walk away if the negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $850,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is too low, there's still room for negotiation.  
* **Strong backup:**  I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $1,200,000, giving me the leverage to push for a better price.

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** My counteroffer is still $200,000 above Bob's offer, but it's now closer to my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also my commitment to not settling for a price significantly below the product's value.
* **Focus on value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to emphasize the reason for my price point.
* **Open to compromise:** I use language like ""middle ground"" to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate further. 
* **Backup plan:** My backup plan with John gives me the confidence to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my minimum price."
