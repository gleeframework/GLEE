# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.
* **You have room to negotiate.** You value the product at $1,500,000, and Alice's minimum is $800,000. This means there's a significant range for finding a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to take control.** By making a counteroffer, you can set the tone for negotiations and potentially secure a better price."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, but it's still within a range where Alice could potentially profit.

* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  You've left some wiggle room for Alice to counter without feeling overly pressured."

# Alice's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Bob. I respect your position and am willing to further adjust our negotiation. I propose a price of $1075000 for the product.
