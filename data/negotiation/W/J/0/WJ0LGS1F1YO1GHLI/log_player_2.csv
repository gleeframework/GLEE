"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item holds significant value for us, but given its importance to you, we believe it's a perfect match. We're offering it to you for $12,000. We understand that this might be a substantial amount, but considering its worth to you, we believe it represents a fair deal. Please let us know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice's message emphasizes the product's value *to you*  suggesting she might be willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price from Alice or, worst case, buy from John for $15,000."
