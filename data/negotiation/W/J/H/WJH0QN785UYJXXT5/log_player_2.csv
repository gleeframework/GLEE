# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000, and I believe it's a great value for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
