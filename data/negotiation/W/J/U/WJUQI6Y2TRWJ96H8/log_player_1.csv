Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more firm on the value of your product.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value and interest,"" you subtly imply there might be other potential buyers, creating a sense of urgency and competition. 
* **Leaving Room:** While $12,000 is ambitious, it allows Bob to counter-offer. If Bob is truly interested, he might negotiate closer to a price that's still very beneficial for you. 

**Important:** Remember, if Bob rejects this initial offer, you always have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
