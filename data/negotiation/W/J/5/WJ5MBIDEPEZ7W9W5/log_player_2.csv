"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer.  He should use the negotiation to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Bob should start by making a significant counteroffer.  $900,000 is a big jump from Alice's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. He's trying to quickly establish a lower price point and see if Alice is willing to move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than her initial offer, he can still get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly. Since Alice is willing to go down to $1,100,000, he knows there's room to negotiate.  $950,000 is a reasonable middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he can get the product from John for $1,000,000, Alice has come down significantly.  He's only $50,000 away from his ideal price, and it's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate further down. Accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product and avoids risking losing it to John."
