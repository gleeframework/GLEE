Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value you see in our product and your budget constraints, I am willing to negotiate further. I am proposing a revised price of $1,100,000 for the product. This still represents a premium over its intrinsic value but offers a substantial discount compared to our initial asking price. I hope this revised offer meets your requirements and allows us to move forward with the transaction.
