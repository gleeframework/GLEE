Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go above $13,000. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk Bob walking away and getting a lower price in later rounds."
