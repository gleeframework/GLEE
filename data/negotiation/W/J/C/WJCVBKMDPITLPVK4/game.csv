"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in your product but $1,050,000 is out of my range. I'm happy to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering I'm willing to purchase the product now. Let's close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
