"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a strong opening move, leaving room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's value to me. I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, and we can then work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.  If Bob doesn't counter within a reasonable time frame, I can always choose to go with John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's well below my minimum value, and while it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss. I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to reach a compromise closer to my desired price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Bob than John's offer, and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm offering $1,000,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it reflects a compromise from my initial offer. I believe Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway.  I'm also considering the time factor â€“ we're already in round 3, and I don't want to risk losing time for a potentially better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not quite there. I'm confident we can reach an agreement closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a common ground.  I'm also aware that time is ticking, and I don't want to risk losing out on a better offer. However,  I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's true value to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering $950,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to find a middle ground. This is still a good price for me, considering the time we've spent negotiating.  It's a fair price point that reflects the product's value and leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will recognize this as a reasonable offer and be willing to accept. If he doesn't, we can continue to negotiate in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $925,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering we're already in round 6.  I'm also aware that the time limit is getting closer, and there's a risk that Bob could withdraw his offer or I might lose out on a better deal with John.  By accepting this offer, I'm securing a good profit while also avoiding potential complications and delays."
