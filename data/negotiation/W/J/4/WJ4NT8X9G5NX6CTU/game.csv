"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $125. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you!",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $130. This is the absolute most I'm willing to pay, and it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go back to $130. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $132. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you!",132.0,Alice,5,
