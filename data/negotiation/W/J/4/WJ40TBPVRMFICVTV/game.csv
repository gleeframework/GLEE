"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if you're interested.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
