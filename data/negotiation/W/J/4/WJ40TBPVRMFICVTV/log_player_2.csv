Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if you're interested.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer of $85 is getting closer to John's price, we still have some room to negotiate. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down a bit more before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to go up to $80, but that's really my limit.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're pushing closer to our limit and matching John's price. This offer puts the ball in Alice's court - she can either accept a slightly lower price or risk losing the sale entirely."
