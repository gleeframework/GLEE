"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?
