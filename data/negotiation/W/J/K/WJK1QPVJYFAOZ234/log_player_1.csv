"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit,  How about $1,000,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
