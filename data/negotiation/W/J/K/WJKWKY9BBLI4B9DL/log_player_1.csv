Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  Given the potential of this product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,100,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm confident this product has significant potential, and I'm willing to invest $1,080,000. This represents a strong commitment from my side, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to close this deal successfully.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

While a higher price is ideal, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting his offer of $1,080,000 guarantees a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
