"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  Given the potential of this product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price recognizes the value you've built, while also allowing me to make a worthwhile investment. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the investment.  However, the value this product represents, particularly to someone like yourself who can maximize its potential, is truly exceptional.  I could consider coming down to $1,120,000. This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value it brings to the table. Let me know your thoughts.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,120,000 is still a bit above my ideal price point.  Given the potential of this product, I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
