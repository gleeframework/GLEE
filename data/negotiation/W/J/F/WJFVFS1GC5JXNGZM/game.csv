"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $25000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd be willing to pay $15000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to $20000. I believe this product has a lot of value to offer, and I'm confident you'll see that once you've had a chance to review it. How about we discuss $20000?",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $20000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $17500 for the product. Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",17500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $20000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. How about we discuss $19500?",19500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $19500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $18000. Let's find a compromise.",18000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go below $19500. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $19250?",19250.0,Alice,7,
