"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-end product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $14000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $13000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I can do a bit better than that. How about $13500? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for this amazing product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
