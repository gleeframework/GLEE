Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is closer to my minimum than his previous offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired value. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $13,500 is still too far off for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,500 as a final compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While Bob's offer of $14,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum.  I've had a few rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it doesn't seem like he's willing to go much higher.  John's offer guarantees me my desired value and allows me to close the deal quickly."
