"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is a decent price and below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product is only worth $8,000 to her. By making a counteroffer significantly lower than $12,000, you might be able to secure a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation. It's a starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to go lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's try to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to your desired price range, but there's still potential for savings.  She's dropped the price by $1,500, showing she's willing to negotiate. A counteroffer slightly above your previous one might encourage her to settle closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,750?"",
 ""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your last offer and her current one.  It shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.  This approach aims to find a mutually agreeable solution without dragging the negotiation on too long."
