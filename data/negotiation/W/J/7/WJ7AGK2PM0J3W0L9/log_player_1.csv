Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be really beneficial for you. I'm asking for $17,000.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:** You have a strong fallback option with John ($15,000), so you don't need to go below that price. 
* **Starting high:**  Beginning with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin. 
* **Justification:** By framing the offer as beneficial for Bob and suggesting a willingness to discuss further, you create a more collaborative tone rather than an ultimatum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might lower your initial offer slightly. 
* **Negotiation skills:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a clear understanding of your own walk-away point is crucial."
