"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'm not comfortable selling it to you for $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $7,750 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $8,200. Let me know if this works for you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
