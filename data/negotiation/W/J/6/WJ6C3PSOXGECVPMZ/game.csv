"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $80 for it.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you do $100? I think that's a fair price.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",130.0,Alice,5,
