Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to you.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $130.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $100 from John, it makes more sense to take that deal and save the $30."
