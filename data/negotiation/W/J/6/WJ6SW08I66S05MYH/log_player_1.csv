"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you first refusal on a truly unique product.  I believe it's worth a significant sum due to its potential, and I'm initially valuing it at $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course, as I'm keen to find it the right home."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm starting significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This creates room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Justification:** I'm hinting at the product's unique value without revealing specifics. This piques Bob's curiosity and encourages him to counter.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I want Bob to engage, so I signal willingness to negotiate.
* **Alternative Option:**  While I haven't explicitly mentioned John,  the phrase ""find it the right home"" subtly implies I have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still aiming higher. Bob's willingness to meet in the middle suggests there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum while trying to maintain the product's perceived high value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, and your understanding of the value this product brings. To be frank, I'm aiming for a figure closer to $1,350,000. This reflects the unique advantages it offers, which I believe could significantly benefit your operations.  Would you be open to discussing this further?"" , 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm coming down in price, but not drastically.  A $150,000 decrease shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's benefits and tailoring them to his potential gain.
* **Encouraging Dialogue:**  I'm phrasing my response as a question to invite further discussion and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but he's still significantly below my $1,000,000 minimum.  I need to signal that I'm getting closer to my bottom line. Rejecting this offer will show Bob I'm serious, but I need to be prepared to make a more substantial counteroffer to keep him engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit based on what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute lowest. I believe this price still reflects the significant value the product holds for you."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm making it clear this is my final offer, using phrases like ""hard limit"" and ""absolute lowest.""  This conveys seriousness without being aggressive.
* **Justification:** I'm not just stating a number; I'm reiterating the value proposition for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $1,250,000 is still a significant profit for me. It's a strong offer designed to hopefully close the deal, but I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit stretched on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,175,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Significant Profit:** While not my ideal price, $1,175,000 is still a substantial profit margin above my $1,000,000 minimum.  
* **Bob is Invested:** Bob has steadily increased his offer throughout the negotiation, indicating strong interest in the product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to push for a higher price risks losing the deal entirely.  Accepting now secures a very good outcome."
