Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale. I'm starting the price at $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me right now. How about $75?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value. I will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $85 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $80.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $80.  It's my minimum value, and it's better than selling to John for the same price."
