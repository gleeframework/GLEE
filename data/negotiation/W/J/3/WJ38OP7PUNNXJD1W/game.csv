"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $16,000 for this product. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let's try to find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $14,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need at least $15,500 to make this deal worthwhile. This is still a good price for you, considering you value the product at $10,000.  Let's close this deal now, how about it?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,500. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,6,
