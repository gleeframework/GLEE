Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $150. I'll continue negotiating, hoping to reach a deal that's more favorable before resorting to buying from John."
