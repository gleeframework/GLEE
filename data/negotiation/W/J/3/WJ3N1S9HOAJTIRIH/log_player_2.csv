# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to your response!

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000. This is still a good deal for me, as it's below my maximum of $1,500,000 and leaves me room to potentially make a profit.  While I'd prefer to pay less, it's possible that Alice won't budge further, and I risk losing a good deal.  With only 5 rounds left, it's time to take this offer."
