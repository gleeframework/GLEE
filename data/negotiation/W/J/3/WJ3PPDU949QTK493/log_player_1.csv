Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$75 is far too low for me. I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price to $110, which is still above my minimum value of $120.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum value. I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John for $120 would be better, but I'm not sure how long I'd have to wait for him to make a decision.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I make a sale quickly."
