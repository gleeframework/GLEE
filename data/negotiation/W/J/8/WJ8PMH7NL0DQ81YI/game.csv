,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find this product at a lower price anywhere else.",100.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $80.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
