"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's interested in the product at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find this product at a lower price anywhere else."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $80? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to reject his offer and try for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $80.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  Would you be willing to settle at $85?  That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I've been negotiating for a while, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. It's possible Bob won't go higher, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next few rounds.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $85."
