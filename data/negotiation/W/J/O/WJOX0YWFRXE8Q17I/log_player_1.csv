Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $130 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 137.50}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $137.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $135? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $135 is a decent price and it's getting close to my minimum. I don't want to risk losing the sale to John, and I feel like I've gotten a good compromise from Bob."
