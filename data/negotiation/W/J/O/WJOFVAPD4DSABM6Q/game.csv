"Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, given its potential to generate $1,200,000 in value.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from its true worth. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still significantly below the product's true worth, and a bit too far from my minimum expectation.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This price reflects the value the product offers you while also ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,000,000. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the value you're willing to accept.",925000.0,Bob,4,
