"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",200.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, though. How about $100? That's my absolute top price.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $100. I appreciate your interest in the product! After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $175. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $125. If you're serious about selling this product, I think this is a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $125. I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at that price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $150. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",150.0,Alice,5,
