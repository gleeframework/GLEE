"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget.  Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tighter budget, but I'm afraid $12,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $16,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $16,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to accept $13,500?  I feel that's a reasonable compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go below $17,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'll offer you $16,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",16500.0,Alice,5,
