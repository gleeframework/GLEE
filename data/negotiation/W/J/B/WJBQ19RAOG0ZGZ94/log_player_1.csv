{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still securing a price above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm aiming for a win-win situation where Bob gets a good deal and I maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $11000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my absolute minimum, I believe I can do better. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $11,000 is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
