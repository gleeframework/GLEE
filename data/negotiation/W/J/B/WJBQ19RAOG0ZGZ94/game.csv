"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $11000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $11000 is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12000.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen!",12000.0,Alice,3,
