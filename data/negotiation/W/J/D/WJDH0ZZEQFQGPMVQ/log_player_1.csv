Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I see the value in this product, your price is higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  To move forward, I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000.  This reflects my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's discuss this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I still believe the product is worth more than $1,400,000 and I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob.  However, I want to see if we can find a price that is more beneficial to me."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is closer to my target, it's still a bit high. To reach a mutually agreeable price, I'm willing to offer $1,450,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and is within my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with him, but I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000. I'm going to see if I can push Bob a bit higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but we're still a bit apart on price.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000, which is closer to your offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  we're getting closer to a deal!  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This reflects the true value I see in the product and allows me to stay within my budget.  If you're willing to accept this offer, we can close the deal right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same price.  It's better to accept and close the deal now."
