"I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $12,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it would bring to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the value it would bring to me.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. Would you consider $16,000? This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $14,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $14,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it would bring to me and the fact that I've already made several concessions.",14000.0,Bob,6,
