Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy is designed to maximize your potential earnings while being reasonable to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to your minimum, you can still potentially get a better price. By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're willing to negotiate and that $130 isn't your final price.  This will allow you to potentially get closer to your target of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's split the difference, how does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $125, would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $125 is just above your minimum, it's still a good deal considering Bob's previous counteroffer.  Since you're already close to your minimum and Bob is unlikely to go higher, it's best to secure the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
