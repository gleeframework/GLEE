"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an exceptional opportunity for anyone looking to elevate their experience. Considering its value, I propose a price of $12,000 for this exclusive item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You're aiming for a price under $10,000. $12,000 is outside your acceptable range.
* **Counteroffer is a better strategy:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so a counteroffer allows for a back-and-forth to potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is higher than I'm willing to go. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be interested in purchasing it for $9,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering our previous discussion, I am willing to consider a price of $10,500 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target:** You're aiming for under $10,000.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit higher.
* **More room for negotiation:**  You still have 7 rounds left. By rejecting the offer, you can continue to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  My budget remains firm at $9,500.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. I appreciate your commitment to finding a fair price. In light of our ongoing discussion, I am proposing a final offer of $10,000 for the product. This reflects the value you place on it while remaining competitive within our current negotiation. I hope this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer matches your maximum budget:**  You're comfortable spending up to $10,000, and Alice has offered exactly that.
* **No point in further negotiation:**  You've reached your target price, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better deal in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting the offer risks Alice backing out or raising her price again.

Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for your maximum price, minimizing your risk."
