Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest and for adjusting your offer. We appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle.

At this point, Alice has come down considerably in price and is getting closer to her own valuation.  While we might be able to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars, the potential savings are not worth the risk of her walking away from the deal. Accepting the $890,000 offer secures a good price for the product."
