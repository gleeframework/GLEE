"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $12,000. This product is truly top-of-the-line, and I believe it's worth a premium. Would you consider $13,000? It's a small compromise for such a valuable asset.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is close, but I need to get at least $12,500 for this.  How about we split the difference and call it a deal?",12500.0,Alice,5,
