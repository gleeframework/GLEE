"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $11000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects its value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
