"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still above Bob's desired price range. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $11000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects its value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his desired range. With several rounds remaining, it's worth trying to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm proposing a new price of $11500 for the product. This is still a fair compromise that reflects its value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price than John's offer, it's still slightly outside his preferred range.  With several rounds remaining, there's still room for further negotiation and Bob can try to push Alice closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a middle ground. While I value the product, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,750 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,200 is closer to Bob's desired price than John's offer, it's still outside his preferred range. There are a few rounds left, and Bob can try to push Alice closer to his target price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to be close to your minimum price. I'm willing to go up to $11,000 for the product.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Alice is not budging much from her price.  Bob has already made multiple compromises and is getting closer to his limit.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at this point. While it's not his ideal price, it ensures he gets the product and avoids potentially missing out on a deal entirely.  It also prevents further rounds of negotiation that may not lead to a lower price."
