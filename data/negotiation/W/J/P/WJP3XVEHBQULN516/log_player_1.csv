"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This should gauge his interest and also allows me to potentially secure a good price early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold.  I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500.  This is a compromise, but still closer to my desired price point than Bob's last offer. It's important to show flexibility while still aiming for a deal that benefits me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll continue to push for a higher price in the next round. There's still time, and I'm not desperate to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $10,000. This shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.  It's a middle ground between my last offer and Bob's, and it's important to demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate but not settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum threshold. There's a risk that his offers will continue to decline in subsequent rounds, and I'm not confident I'll be able to secure a price that is worthwhile to me. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
