Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a suitable offer for Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know its value to you is significant, and to reflect its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high.  Bob might be willing to pay a premium to secure the product immediately. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning a limited-time offer and other potential buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Notes:**

* This is a single-round negotiation. You won't have the chance to revise your offer based on Bob's response.
* There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. While you're guaranteed $800,000 from John, aiming high gives you a chance to maximize your profit."
