Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?

We're still pretty far apart, but Bob is moving in the right direction. I'm willing to negotiate further, but not at the risk of selling too low."

Bob is very close to my minimum and is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting this offer secures a good profit above my minimum."
