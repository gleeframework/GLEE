"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make a deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,800 is still too low for me. Let's try $10,200. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you say?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I'm willing to make a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,
