"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but that price is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  It's significantly less than what I would receive from other buyers.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and a reasonable compromise for me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about $750,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $750,000 is still a bit too low for me, given the value of the product. However, I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
