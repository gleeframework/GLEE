Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this point.  I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired value."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is just too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my commitment to making this deal work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,500,000.  I'm determined to get as close to my desired value as possible, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to reach a compromise in the next few rounds."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiations so far. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While we've made progress in negotiations, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low. John is a sure thing, offering me my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him."
