"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to make an offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more to me. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",775000.0,Alice,5,
