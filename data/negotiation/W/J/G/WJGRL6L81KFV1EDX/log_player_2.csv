"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to make an offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more to me. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $775,000.  At this point, John's offer of $800,000 is the better deal."
