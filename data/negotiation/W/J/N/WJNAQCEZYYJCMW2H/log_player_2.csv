"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $100 from John.  Alice's offer of $95 is better than John's, but you can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so you are offering a price that is slightly above her value but still below your maximum of $100. This leaves room for negotiation, but also demonstrates you're serious about buying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is still better than John's offer of $100. While further negotiation is possible, it's likely Alice won't go lower than $85. It's not worth risking the deal for a potential $5 savings, especially since John's price is a guaranteed alternative."
