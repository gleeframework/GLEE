"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for the best possible price while keeping in mind the potential of selling to John for $80 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $80.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to accept an offer that undervalues my product.  I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering with a price of $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it gives me a better chance of reaching an agreement while still staying above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired price. I will counteroffer again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my goal.  However, with each round, the option of selling to John for $80 becomes more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm countering with $85. This is a significant compromise,  getting closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this is enough to convince Bob to accept, as the risk of selling to John for $80 is becoming increasingly tempting with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but given that Bob's offer is at my minimum value and I've already rejected several offers, I'm going to take the guaranteed $80 from John. The risk of continued negotiation is too high at this point, as I could end up with less."
