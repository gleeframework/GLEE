"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but $1,400,000 is the highest I can go at this time. This price reflects a fair compromise and provides a profitable outcome for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
