"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum value:**  I'm not giving it away for less than I'm willing to accept.
* **It's a strong opening:**  A high starting point can signal the product's value and potentially lead to a good middle ground. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I have room to come down a bit in subsequent rounds. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum value, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob just yet. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm serious about negotiating. However, it's still above my minimum value, and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
