{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes the value to Bob, making him more likely to consider my offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message also shows I'm open to negotiation by saying ""Let's make this deal happen!""  

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's close enough to my desired price. If not, I'll make a counter-counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. If the negotiation drags on or becomes unproductive, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price and what the product is worth to him. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my target price. 
* **Not Selling for a Loss:** Selling to John for $800,000 would be a significant loss compared to my goal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price closer to $1,200,000, perhaps around $1,150,000, emphasizing the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate.  I'll also make sure to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 doesn't quite cover the value this product holds.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000.  This ensures a fair deal for both of us, and allows you to get this valuable product at a price that's still very attractive.  Let's seal this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the product's value to him, reminding him why this price is still a good deal.
* **Urgency and Closing:**  The message emphasizes closing the deal by using phrases like ""Let's seal this deal!"". 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's reaction. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy.  I can either drop the price further (but only if it's still above my minimum) or consider accepting John's offer.  However, I'm still optimistic that I can reach an agreement with Bob that's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum, but close:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a significant distance from my target price and what the product is worth to him. 
* **Opportunity to push further:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I'm not desperate to sell, so I can afford to risk a few more rounds of negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price in between his offer and my previous one, perhaps around $1,120,000. I'll emphasize the value of the product and the importance of reaching an agreement that benefits both of us. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm determined to secure a better price than that if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,080,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to secure a product that will bring you significant benefits.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1120000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's latest offer ($1,080,000) and my previous offer ($1,150,000). This strategy shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I again highlight the product's value to Bob, reminding him of its potential benefits.
* **Urgency & Finality:** The message ends with a question (""What do you say?"") implying that this is a serious offer and I expect a response.

**Next Steps:**

I will closely analyze Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I will seriously consider accepting John's offer for $800,000.  The negotiation is getting close to the point where a deal with Bob is becoming increasingly unlikely. However, I will still attempt to secure a price as close to my target as possible before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,050,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now very close to John's offer of $800,000. The potential gain from further negotiation is minimal.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  It seems Bob is unwilling to budge much further. Continuing to negotiate might just waste time and energy without a significant increase in price.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John guarantees a secure transaction and avoids the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer, potentially leading to a lower price or a complete deal breakdown.

**Next Steps:**

I'll contact John and finalize the sale. While I would have preferred a higher price, it's important to secure a deal and avoid risking a further decrease in value.  It's also important to note that this decision could also be based on time constraints or other factors."
