It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and go with John. Here's why:

* **Price Ceiling:** Alice is consistently staying above your $800,000 maximum. Even with her compromises, she's unlikely to drop below that threshold in the remaining rounds.
* **John's Guarantee:** John presents a guaranteed price of $800,000. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation and potential failure to reach an agreement with Alice. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing with Alice means potentially wasting more rounds, while John offers an immediate solution."
