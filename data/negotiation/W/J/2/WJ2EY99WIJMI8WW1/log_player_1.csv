Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key is to price the product high enough to maximize potential profit from Bob but low enough that he'd still prefer buying it to letting it go to John. 

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $875,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested party waiting."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency. Highlighting the ""other interested party"" reminds Bob he might lose out.
* **Product Price:** $875,000 is a significant markup from your minimum and still below Bob's perceived value.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** This strategy assumes Bob is somewhat risk-averse. If he's a hard bargainer and willing to risk losing the product, he might reject the offer.
* **Relationship Building:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is more important than maximizing immediate profit, a slightly lower price might be more suitable. 

Let me know what you think!"
