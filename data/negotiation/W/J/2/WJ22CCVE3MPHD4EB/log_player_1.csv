Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to capitalize on Bob's valuation.  I'll be ready to negotiate further if he counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm countering with $115, which is still a bit higher than Bob's offer but closer to my minimum. This should keep the negotiations going while hopefully securing a higher price."
