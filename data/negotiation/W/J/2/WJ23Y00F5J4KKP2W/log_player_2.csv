"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's in great condition and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low a price as possible, ideally below his $120 limit. Alice's initial offer of $175 is far too high. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by immediately presenting Bob's maximum price. While it's unlikely Alice will accept this right away, it sets a clear boundary and demonstrates Bob's commitment to his price limit. This approach encourages Alice to consider a more reasonable counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $140 to make this work.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $140, it's still above Bob's limit of $120. He's determined to get the best deal possible and has John as a backup option.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open for Bob to potentially achieve a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $130.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer maintains a firm but reasonable stance. It moves closer to Alice's previous offer but remains within Bob's budget, showing that he's willing to compromise without exceeding his limit.  The message emphasizes a fair compromise, aiming to encourage Alice to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer of $130, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price.  How about $135?  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still above Bob's target price of $120. While it's getting closer, Bob has the option of buying from John for a lower price. Therefore, rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price from Alice or to secure the product from John if the negotiation doesn't yield a favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $132, but that's my final offer. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 132}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying within Bob's budget. By increasing the offer slightly and declaring it ""final,"" it puts pressure on Alice to consider accepting, as further negotiation could lead to Bob opting for John's offer."
