"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth, but I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is tempting, it's significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to recoup my investment, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value we both see in this opportunity. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price reflects the value we both see in the product and would allow us to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
