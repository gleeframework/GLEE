# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is tempting, it's significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to recoup my investment, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value we both see in this opportunity. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
