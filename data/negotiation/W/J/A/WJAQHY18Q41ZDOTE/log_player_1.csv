Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  While I believe $1,900,000 is still high, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a smart move at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** Even though it's less than my ideal price, it's still a $400,000 profit. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and the possibility of Bob lowering his offer or walking away.
* **Uncertainty of Further Negotiation:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer more than $1,400,000 in subsequent rounds. 
 
Accepting a sure $1,400,000 now outweighs the risk of aiming for more and potentially getting less."
