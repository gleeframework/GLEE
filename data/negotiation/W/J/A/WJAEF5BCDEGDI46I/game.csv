"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While it's a step closer, I'm still not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1100000 is still too far below what this product is worth.  To be honest, I'm starting to think that we may not be able to agree on a price.  To show you I'm serious about finding a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
