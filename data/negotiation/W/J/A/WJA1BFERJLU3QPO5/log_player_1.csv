"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $120. I'll see how Bob responds before adjusting my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'd be happy to get $120, I'm not willing to settle for the minimum right away.  There's still room to negotiate, and I want to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer. I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise that's higher than Bob's offer, but still less than my initial price.  Hopefully, this will get us closer to an agreement without risking losing Bob entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is close to my minimum and I'm concerned that if I reject it, he might get frustrated and walk away.  It's better to secure a sale at this price than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to sell to John for $120."
