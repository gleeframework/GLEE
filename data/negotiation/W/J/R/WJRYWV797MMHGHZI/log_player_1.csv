"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm countering with $98. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and leaves room for further negotiation. I believe this is a fair price that both of us can be happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's only $2 more than John's offer, it's still higher and I'm getting closer to my target.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, so it's better to take what I have now."
