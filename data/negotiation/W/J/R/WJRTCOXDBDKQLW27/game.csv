"I appreciate your interest in selling the product to me, but I'm not willing to go as high as $2,200,000. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique benefits, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,700,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
