"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you first.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my valuation and Bob's perceived value. This anchors the negotiation higher and leaves room for strategic concessions. 
* **Justification:** While the price is high, I'm framing it around the ""unique opportunity"" the product represents, implying benefits beyond Bob's initial assessment. 
* **Maintaining Options:**  I haven't revealed my guaranteed offer from John. This keeps the pressure on Bob and allows me to leverage John's offer if needed in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your interest in selling the product to me, but I'm not willing to go as high as $2,200,000. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is already above his own valuation of $1,000,000, indicating he sees value in the product.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  We are still significantly apart, but there's room for negotiation between his offer and John's guaranteed $1,500,000.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By rejecting, we maintain a degree of pressure and signal that we know the product's worth.

I will aim to negotiate closer to $1,500,000 in the subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer ($300,000) to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate more seriously. 
* **Still Above Target:** I'm still aiming to secure a price well above Bob's valuation and closer to John's offer, preserving the option to walk away.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the ""unique benefits"" to remind Bob of the potential value beyond his initial assessment and justify the high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique benefits, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,700,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Deal:** $1,700,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Strong Negotiating Position:** Bob has consistently increased his offer and is now willing to pay substantially more than his initial valuation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting secures a very good deal now."
