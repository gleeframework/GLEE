"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high with $15,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.  It also signals that I believe the product is valuable and sets the tone for a higher potential sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to meet halfway, but I'm still trying to get closer to my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $12,500.  While I would like to get closer to my initial asking price,  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and this is a good deal.  It's better than selling to John and I'm getting closer to my target value.  I'm also running out of rounds."
