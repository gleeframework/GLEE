"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know holds great value for your business. I'm confident it will be a significant asset.  My price is $1,400,000, which is a fair reflection of its worth. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know your decision soon. If you decline, I have another buyer waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** Even though Alice's price is higher than her own valuation, it's still $100,000 less than what John would charge. 
* **Bob's goal is to save money.** Accepting Alice's offer achieves that goal."
