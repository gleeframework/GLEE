Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still above his target.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John for $8,000.  There's a chance Alice will continue to refuse counteroffers and the negotiation might go on indefinitely.  Buying from John guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget."
