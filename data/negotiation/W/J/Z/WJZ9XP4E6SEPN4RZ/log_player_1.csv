"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum price, but I also want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $14,500 is getting closer, I'm going to try for one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $15,500 as a final offer. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the highest I can go. I hope you can understand my position and consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum desired price, and I'm only halfway through the negotiation process. While I could continue trying to get a better price from Bob, I don't want to risk losing out on the guaranteed $15,000 from John. It's better to secure the sale and move on."
