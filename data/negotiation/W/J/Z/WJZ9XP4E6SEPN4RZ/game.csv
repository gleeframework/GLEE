"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $15,500 as a final offer. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's make this happen!",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the highest I can go. I hope you can understand my position and consider my offer.",14000.0,Bob,6,
