,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $7,500 is significantly below its value.  I could let it go for $9,000.  It's a fair offer considering how much you'll benefit from it.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is valuable, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. That's the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8250.0,Bob,4,
