"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I think $900,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to pay that amount.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise considering the benefits this product offers you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,050,000. How about $950,000? It's a fair price considering the benefits this product offers me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. It's a good price, but it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $1,000,000? This way we both get a fair deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. How about $980,000? It's a fair price considering the benefits this product offers me.",980000.0,Bob,6,
