"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more like $1,200,000.  Would that be acceptable?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
