"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $20,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. Let's meet in the middle, how about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need a price that works for me too.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $15,250?",15250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $15,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $14,250?",14250.0,Bob,6,
