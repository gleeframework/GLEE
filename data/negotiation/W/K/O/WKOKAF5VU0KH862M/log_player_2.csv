"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to me, but considering its value to you, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's aim for a fair price. Would you like to start by suggesting a price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is quite close to her perceived value. There's plenty of room for negotiation. It's better to counter-offer and see if we can get a price closer to our $120 limit before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) leaves room for negotiation while signaling our budget constraints. 
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counter-offer will help us understand how much Alice is willing to budge from her initial price. Her response will guide our next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. To move forward, I propose we meet somewhere in the middle. How about we consider a price of $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but $125 is still above our target price. We're only $5 away from John's offer, so it's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can get closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $125 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you be willing to do it for $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to a potential agreement. Offering $110 splits the difference between her previous offer ($125) and our last counter-offer ($100).
* **Staying Firm:** While remaining flexible, we're still aiming for a price that provides significant savings compared to John's $120 offer.
* **Time Constraint:** We have a limited number of rounds, so it's important to make steady progress towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, how about we set the price at $120 for the product? This would still be a good deal for you, while also allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has matched John's price! There's no longer any benefit to going with John, and pushing for a lower price with Alice is unlikely to be successful. Accepting this offer ensures we get the product at the best possible price."
