"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $132.  This is a fair price that allows you to make some profit, and I can still stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",132.0,Bob,4,
