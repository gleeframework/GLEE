Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, giving you room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It's also important to be friendly and encouraging in your message to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I was hoping for a price closer to $10000. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $12000? I appreciate your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and John is willing to pay that amount.  It's not worth risking further negotiation."
