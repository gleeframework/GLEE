"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $14000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16000?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not sure I can meet you at $16000. I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. Can you consider that?,13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet.  Let's try $15000.  That's a good compromise and it's still within my range. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
