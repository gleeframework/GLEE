"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you.  It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something you highly value at a price that's still very favorable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to her ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to get a better price, closer to her actual valuation.  Worst case, you can always buy from John for $15,000."
