{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a strong starting offer that leaves room for negotiation. It's above your minimum price of $800,000 but still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. This allows for a good chance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is better than John's offer, it's still below my desired price. I'll counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I still think that's a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but no more. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to $1,100,000, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a decent compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and still leaves me with a good profit. It's time to accept and finalize the deal."
