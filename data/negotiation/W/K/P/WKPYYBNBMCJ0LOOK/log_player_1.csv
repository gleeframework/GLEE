"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a good starting point to maximize my profit.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob and emphasizing the potential for a good deal.
* **Open communication:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob's offer is closer to my desired price range, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Time to counter:** I have several rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiations with Bob fall apart, I can always sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Value justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing the potential for a good deal even at my counteroffer price.
* **Finality:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm setting a clear price point that shows I'm serious about closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product. It's the highest price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $500 less than John's offer, which is my absolute minimum. 
* **Limited time:** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether.
* **Potential for counteroffer:** Even though I'm accepting, I can always try to negotiate a slightly higher price in future rounds if there's an opportunity."
