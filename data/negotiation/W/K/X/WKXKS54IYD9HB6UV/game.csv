"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm only willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a great price for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but $925,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer you $910,000 for the product. This is a very fair compromise, and I believe it's the best chance to close the deal. What do you say?",910000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $910,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $915,000. This is a very small difference, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move on.",915000.0,Alice,7,
