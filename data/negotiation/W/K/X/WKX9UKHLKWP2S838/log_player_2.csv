{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. It's above your budget, and you have room to negotiate.  Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

Let's start with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A million dollars is a significant drop from her initial offer, and it's still within the realm of possibility for a good deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still not quite where I want it to be. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get it lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $1,100,000.  This is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer and shows that I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but it's still a bit too high. I'm going to see if I can get it down even further with another counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
