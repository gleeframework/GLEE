"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm going to start with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000 yet. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,650,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. It's also a good midpoint between my minimum and Bob's last offer, hopefully encouraging him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a great deal for me. It's my minimum price, and I've only used 4 rounds. I don't want to risk getting a worse offer from Bob in the next round, and John is always a viable option if I need to."
