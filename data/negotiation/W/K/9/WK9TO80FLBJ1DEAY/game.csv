"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget is a bit tight, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $13,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a fair price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500, which is a compromise from my original offer. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",14500.0,Alice,5,
