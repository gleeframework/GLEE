"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique features and potential for you, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a lower price, potentially saving a significant amount of money.  There's no guarantee of success, but it's worth a try before resorting to John's higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it offers me, and it leaves some room for you to still make a good profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident in its potential for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and ultimately forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting Alice's offer at $1,300,000 saves $200,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise that secures the product within Bob's budget."
