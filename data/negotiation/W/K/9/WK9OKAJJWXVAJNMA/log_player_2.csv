"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $130 is within your budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead to a counter-offer with a lower price, closer to her $100 value.  You can always fall back on buying from John for $150 if needed."
