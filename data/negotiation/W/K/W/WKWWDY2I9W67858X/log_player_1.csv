""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, mentioning ""its value"" subtly hints that you're aware it's desirable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal your willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. 

By starting with a price of $15,000, Alice aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a profit above her minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects the offer, she can always negotiate down or proceed with selling to John at $12,000, ensuring she doesn't lose out."
