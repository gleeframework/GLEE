Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000 as a fair price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better deal.  It's also worth noting that John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, giving me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While your offer is lower than what I can accept, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm offering the product to you for $1,150,000.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000.  I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better deal.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so there's no pressure to accept a lower offer just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,135,000?  This price is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 1135000}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 4 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better deal.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  We're getting very close. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $1,140,000.  This offer is a significant step towards finding a mutually agreeable price.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1140000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. Considering the ongoing negotiations and aiming for a balance, I would like to propose $1,135,000 as the final price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,135,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the wire with only two rounds left. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I'm concerned that we'll run out of time and I'll be forced to accept an offer below my minimum. To ensure I get at least my minimum price, it's safer to sell to John at this point.  It's a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, which is more than what Bob is currently offering."
