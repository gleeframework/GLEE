* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000.** 
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You're trying to stay under $15,000, and Alice's offer of $13,750 is below that.
* **You've already negotiated significantly:** You've made multiple counteroffers, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject this offer, Alice might be less likely to negotiate further, and you could end up having to buy from John at a higher price.

**While you could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance you won't get a better deal. It's a good time to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's within your budget.**"
