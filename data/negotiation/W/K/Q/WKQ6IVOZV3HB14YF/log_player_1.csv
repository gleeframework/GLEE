Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm interested in purchasing the product at a lower price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm proposing a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Bob is still significantly undercutting the product's value. It's time to push closer to my minimum and see if he's willing to negotiate seriously."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, I have a standing offer for $1,500,000 from another buyer.  I'm willing to make a significant move to close this deal with you, but it needs to make sense for me. I'm proposing $1,600,000. This is my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have a standing offer from another buyer, but I'm still interested in purchasing the product from you. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm willing to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise. It surpasses my minimum requirement and avoids the risk of continued negotiation or losing the sale altogether. Accepting this offer ensures a significant profit and a quick close to the deal."
