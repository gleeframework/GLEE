"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,100,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm interested in purchasing the product at a lower price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you proposed doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to move a bit closer to your range, let's say $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm proposing a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, I have a standing offer for $1,500,000 from another buyer.  I'm willing to make a significant move to close this deal with you, but it needs to make sense for me. I'm proposing $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a standing offer from another buyer, but I'm still interested in purchasing the product from you. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm willing to close the deal quickly.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
