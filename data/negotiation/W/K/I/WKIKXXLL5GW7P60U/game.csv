"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a fair price considering its value to you.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $90. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle, Alice. How about $70?  That's a significant jump from my original offer and a fair price for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make another small adjustment and offer it to you for $85. This is the best I can do, considering the value I place on the product.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're very close to a price I'd be comfortable with.  Would you consider $75? I think that's a really fair offer at this point.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to a price you're comfortable with, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you at $75. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer it to you for $82. This is the best I can do, considering the value I place on the product.",82.0,Alice,7,
