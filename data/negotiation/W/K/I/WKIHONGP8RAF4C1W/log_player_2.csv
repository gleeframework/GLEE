$400,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely do better.  I'll see what Alice is willing to counter with."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 200000}

I'm going to start by making a low counteroffer, significantly less than Alice's initial price. This is a strong negotiating tactic to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially secure a good deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}

I'm going to increase my offer again to $300,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, but it's still lower than Alice's current offer. I'm hoping that this will convince Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has gone back to her initial offer. This could be a sign that she is unwilling to negotiate further, or it could be a tactic to pressure me into accepting.  I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get her to budge. I'm not willing to buy from John yet, as there's still room for a deal with Alice."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my offer again to $325,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. I'm hoping that this will be a sweet spot where we can finally reach an agreement. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a few rounds left to work with, so I'm not rushing to accept any offer yet."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $425,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has gone up again.  It's clear that we're not going to agree on a price, and I only have one round left. To avoid risking losing the opportunity to buy the product altogether, I'm going to buy from John. Although it's a significantly higher price, it's better than missing out on the product entirely."
