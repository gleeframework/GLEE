"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with this offer. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree that it's a great product, but I'm not quite ready to meet your starting price. How about we settle around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello again Alice. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Could we consider a price closer to $800,000?  That would be a good compromise, I think.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go back to the original offer of $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. How about we settle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $925,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more adjustment. How about we settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,7,
