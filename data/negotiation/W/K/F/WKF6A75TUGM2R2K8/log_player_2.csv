# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Alice has come down to $110, which is within my budget and a good deal.  It's better than going to John and paying $150.  I'll accept this offer."
