"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product seems great, I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point.  Would you be willing to consider $12,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original price. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
