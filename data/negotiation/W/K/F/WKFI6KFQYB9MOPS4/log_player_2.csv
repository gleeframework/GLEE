Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I cannot lower the price further than $140 due to the cost involved. I would like to offer you the product for $125 instead. This is a price point that still allows me to maintain a fair profit while being competitive in the market. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.
