"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I understand this product has value, but $1,075,000 feels like a more reasonable compromise, allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this price is fair and allows for a good profit margin for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to our desired price range. Holding firm for another round is worth the risk of losing the deal with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to consider $1,100,000. This reflects my desire to reach an agreement and acknowledges your interest in the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I believe $1,090,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now very close to our $1.1M target, and the increments are getting smaller. While we might be able to squeeze out a little more, there's a real risk he'll walk away or that the gains won't outweigh the remaining time and effort. Accepting at $1,090,000 locks in a very good profit."
