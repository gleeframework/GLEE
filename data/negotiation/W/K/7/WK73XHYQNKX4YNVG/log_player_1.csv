"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's estimated value. This allows for some negotiation space while still being a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price Alice. How about we settle at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, it's not worth risking further negotiations. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'll sell to him and avoid any further haggling."
