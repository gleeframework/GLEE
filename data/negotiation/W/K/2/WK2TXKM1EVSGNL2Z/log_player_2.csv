"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This item holds significant value to me, but recognizing its potential worth to you, I am willing to consider a transaction. Given its exceptional quality and rarity, I propose a purchase price of $950,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value it holds for us and the benefits it could bring to you. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you require further details. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer but not ideal.** You can get the product for $50,000 less from Alice.
* **You have a stronger negotiating position.** You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, which gives you leverage to try and get a lower price from Alice.
* **Rejection allows for potential negotiation.** By rejecting, you can signal to Alice that you're willing to walk away and potentially lead to a counter-offer closer to your desired price."
