"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I think it's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate and see if we can get a better price from Alice first. $100 is still a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's low enough to leave room for bargaining but still demonstrates serious interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our ideal price, but we can still try to negotiate a bit further down.  We'll reject this offer and propose something closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that you have a bottom line, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $70? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're moving closer to both our budget and a potential agreement with Alice.  This offer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a significant saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $70 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $75? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is very close to our ideal price and is willing to compromise. Accepting this offer allows us to get the product for a price lower than John's while avoiding the risk of further negotiation."
