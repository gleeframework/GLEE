"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you have a bottom line, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $70? That's a fair compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $70 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $75? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",75.0,Alice,5,
