Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, so he might be willing to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $12,000 is still above your minimum price of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** Bob knows exactly what you're offering.

If Bob rejects the offer, you can then either lower your price slightly or  make a counteroffer based on his counteroffer.  If negotiations stall, you can always fall back on selling to John for your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000.  While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to compromise that much. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum price. It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale rather than risk further negotiations with Bob or selling to John, which would mean less profit for me."
