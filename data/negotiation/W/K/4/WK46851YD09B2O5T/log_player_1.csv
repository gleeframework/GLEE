Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $200. This leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is interested, while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm hoping to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware that if Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
