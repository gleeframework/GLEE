"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the market value and our negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below my minimum. This product has immense value that I'm confident you'll benefit from. How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Considering your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'll counter with $950,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
