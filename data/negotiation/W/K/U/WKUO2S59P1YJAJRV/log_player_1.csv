Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies that the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating Bob would be overpaying.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""initially proposing"" and ""What do you think?"" indicates a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Important Note:**  Alice needs to be prepared to potentially lower her price during the negotiation if Bob counters. She should determine her walk-away point in advance (the lowest price she's willing to accept before going to John)."
