{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to you ($1,500,000). You have plenty of room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly higher than Alice's offer, but still within your budget. It shows Alice that you are serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate.  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you ($1,500,000). You have ample room for further negotiation, and rejecting her offer allows you to make another counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too low.  By counteroffering with $1,000,000, you're showing willingness to meet her halfway. This price is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you, but it might be enticing enough for Alice to accept. If she doesn't, you can still make another counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, but it's still below your ideal price point.  There's still potential for a better deal. Rejecting her offer will allow you to make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly coming down in price, but she's still not meeting your ideal price point. Counteroffering at $950,000 shows that you're willing to compromise, but it's still within your budget and a reasonable price for the product. It also leaves room for a slight increase from Alice's offer, which could lead to a deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $950,000. At this point, continuing to negotiate risks a potential deal with Alice. Accepting her offer ensures you get the product for a price that's significantly lower than what you're willing to pay, and also within a reasonable range of your desired price.  It's a good compromise that saves you a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
