"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand you're looking to stay within your budget. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,600,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This price reflects the product's true value, and it gives us both a chance to make a mutually beneficial deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
