"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate down if necessary. It also establishes my initial value for the product.  I'll be watching Bob's response to see how much he values it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I think I can still get more. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm offering $9,750. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway from his last offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price. We've reached a point where further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure the sale now rather than risk ending up with the lower price from John."
