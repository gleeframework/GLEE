"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1200000.  This price reflects a fair market value and allows for a profitable partnership.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me to accept.  However, I am open to finding a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1300000.  This price still allows for a healthy profit for me, while also offering you a substantial opportunity for growth. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
