# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your company. I'm offering it to you for $1400000.  This price reflects the product's inherent worth and its potential to generate significant returns for you. Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, you can potentially do better. You're still within your budget and there's room to negotiate further.  It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me to accept.  However, I am open to finding a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1300000.  This price still allows for a healthy profit for me, while also offering you a substantial opportunity for growth. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is still within your budget and a good price.  It's getting closer to your initial counteroffer of $1,200,000, and further negotiation might not get you a significantly better deal.  At this point, accepting her offer seems like the most reasonable choice.  You're saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John, and you've still achieved a good price for yourself."
