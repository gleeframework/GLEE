**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price close enough to John's $80 offer.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of Alice increasing her price or the deal falling through entirely.  Buying from John guarantees the product at the best known price."
