"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm still finding it hard to justify a price that high. Would you be open to $720,000? I feel that's a very reasonable offer.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $830,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",830000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that.  $775,000 is a significant investment on your part, but I have to be firm on this.  My final offer is $800,000.  This is a very fair price for what you're getting. Take it or leave it.",800000.0,Alice,7,
