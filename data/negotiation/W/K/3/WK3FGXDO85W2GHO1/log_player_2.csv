"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this product.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. I think it's a fair price considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her product's worth to her, but it's still more than I'm willing to pay.  There's room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price of $1,300,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject my counteroffer again.  At this point, it's better to secure the product at a price that's still within my budget and less than what John is offering."
