You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is within your budget of $10,000.  Accepting this offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price and you risk losing the deal altogether."
