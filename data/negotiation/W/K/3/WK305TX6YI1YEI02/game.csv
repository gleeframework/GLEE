"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $900,000 is a little high.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for me.  How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer to $780,000 to try and get this finalized.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm not willing to accept $780,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $815,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting concerned we won't be able to make a deal.  To avoid wasting more of our time, I can go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit.",800000.0,Bob,8,
