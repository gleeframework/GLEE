"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. My initial price is $1,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which I believe is still a fair price given the value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  That would be a fair compromise, don't you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $925,000 is closer, but still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers - let's try $962,500. This reflects the value this product brings, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",962500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, to be completely comfortable, I'd need to be at $940,000. I believe that reflects a fair deal for both of us.",940000.0,Bob,6,
