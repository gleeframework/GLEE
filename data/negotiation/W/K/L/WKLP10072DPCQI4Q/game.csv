"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe the product is a great asset, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $900,000? I think that's a fair price for the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
