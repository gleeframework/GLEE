Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. My final counteroffer is $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're interested, this is your last chance to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
