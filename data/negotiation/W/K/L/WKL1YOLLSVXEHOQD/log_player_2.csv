"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know John will sell for. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product! I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $65?"", ""product_price"": 65}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While this is quite a bit lower than Alice's initial offer, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. It's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it leaves room to work up.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message aims to be polite and show interest in the product while clearly stating the price is an issue. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting low, we're aiming to eventually land somewhere between $65 and $80, which is a good deal for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not comfortable selling the product for $65. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice met us halfway, $90 is still above both our budget and what John offers. There's room for negotiation, and we're likely to get a better deal by countering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $90 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to do $75?"", ""product_price"": 75}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to split the difference between her current offer ($90) and our previous offer ($65). This shows we're willing to negotiate and move closer to her price.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  Crucially, we stay under our $80 maximum, leaving a little room to negotiate up if needed. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit far from your target price. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price we can agree on! However, $85 is still slightly above our ideal price and what John is offering. There's a chance we can get Alice to come down another $5, so it's worth one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're really working with me here, I appreciate it.  How about we split the difference and settle at $80? That seems fair to me."", ""product_price"": 80}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:**  We've reached the maximum we're willing to pay. This offer firmly establishes our position.
* **Presenting a Compromise:**  By suggesting splitting the difference, we frame it as a win-win solution for both parties.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  While we're still hoping Alice agrees, we're mentally prepared to buy from John for $80 if she rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $82.50. It's still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go any lower.  While $82.50 isn't a terrible price, we know we can get the product for $80 from John.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed deal."
