"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $140 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is a bit steep, but I think the product is worth more than $105. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $130 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $115 yet. I'm willing to compromise at $125. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",125.0,Alice,5,
