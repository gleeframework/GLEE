Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $14,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $16,500 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hesitant to accept. I'd like to see if I can push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $16,500 is still a bit high for me, though. How about we split the difference and settle on $15,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15,500. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, which is still a compromise, but reflects the product's true value. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment at this price. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better deal from Alice.  It's getting close to my limit, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product altogether.  John's offer is the best way to guarantee I get it at a price I'm comfortable with."
