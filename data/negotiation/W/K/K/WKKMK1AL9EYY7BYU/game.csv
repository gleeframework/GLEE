"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $14,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $16,500 is still a bit high for me, though. How about we split the difference and settle on $15,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15,500. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, which is still a compromise, but reflects the product's true value. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment at this price. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",16000.0,Alice,5,
