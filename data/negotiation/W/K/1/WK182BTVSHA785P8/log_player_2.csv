Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $97 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $101? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think.

It's not worth haggling with Alice any further. She's unlikely to go much lower, and it's better to secure the product for $100 from John."
