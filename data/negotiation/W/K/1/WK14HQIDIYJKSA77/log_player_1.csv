Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $8,900. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $10,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer of $10,000 from John.

Offering the product at $8,900 aims to maximize profit while keeping it attractive to Bob:

* **Profitable:**  It's significantly more than John's offer, ensuring a good profit.
* **Enticing for Bob:** It's slightly above Bob's valuation, but the message emphasizes fairness and leaves room for negotiation. 

By starting high but still within a potentially acceptable range for Bob, you increase the chance of him counter-offering and reaching a deal that benefits both parties. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on John's guaranteed purchase."
