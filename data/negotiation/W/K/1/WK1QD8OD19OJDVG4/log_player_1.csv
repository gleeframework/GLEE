Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Confidence and Value:**  The message highlights the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message indicates I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts, suggesting flexibility. 

This approach allows me to start the negotiation strategically while still leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob is interested, there's still room to negotiate a higher price.  I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a compromise.

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $150, but still acknowledging his budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraint by lowering my price from the initial offer, but not going too low.
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm inviting further discussion and negotiation, signaling flexibility.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's final offer of $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of Further Reduction:**  If I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, leaving me with nothing.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is my minimum goal.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd like to get closer to $150, the risk of losing Bob and getting no profit outweighs the potential benefit of further negotiation.  Selling to John is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
