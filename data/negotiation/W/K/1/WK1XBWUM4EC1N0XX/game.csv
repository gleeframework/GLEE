"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500?  That's still a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to a price I can afford. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $7,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's do $8,000. This is a really great product, and I think it's worth it.",8000.0,Alice,5,
