"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? Let's make this happen.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $10,250 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000. Could you do $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $9,500 is just a bit too far off for me. Let's split the difference. How about $10,000? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
