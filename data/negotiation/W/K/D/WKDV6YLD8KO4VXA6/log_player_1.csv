Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your new one. How about we try $1,225,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob has shown a willingness to move. There's room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I think we can meet in the middle again. How about $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now offered $1,200,000 twice. This indicates this might be his upper limit. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit of $200,000 over John's offer. Continuing to negotiate has the potential for more profit, but also risks Bob backing out altogether."
