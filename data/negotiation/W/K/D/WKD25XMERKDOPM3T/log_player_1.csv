Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hmm, $140 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we try to meet closer to the middle? Would you consider $100?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, I have a hard limit at $100.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $100 is his absolute limit.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we can push him much further. Accepting his offer would result in a $50 loss compared to John's offer. It's strategically better to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $150 from John."
