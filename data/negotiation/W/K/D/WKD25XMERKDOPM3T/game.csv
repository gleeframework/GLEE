"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that's your limit, Bob, but $80 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hmm, $140 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we try to meet closer to the middle? Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine - would you do $120?",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, I have a hard limit at $100.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I need to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
