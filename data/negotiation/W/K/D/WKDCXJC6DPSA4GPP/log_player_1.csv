Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target Price:**  My ideal price is $1,500,000, but I want to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with $1,450,000. This is a significant amount for Bob, but it still leaves me with a profit of $450,000, which is more than half of my minimum value for the product.
* **Strategic Thinking:** By starting at a slightly lower price, I signal that I'm open to negotiation but still maintain a strong position. It also encourages Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing me to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to go back and forth with counteroffers. However, I have a backup plan in John, who is willing to pay my full target price. This gives me a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant financial loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he is interested in the product. This means there's room for further negotiation.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer of $1,450,000, but still lower than my target price to see if we can find common ground.  
* **Backup plan:** It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

**Next steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is higher than his offer but still leaves me with a reasonable profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum value.  $1,350,000 is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate for a sale.
* **Maintain Profit:** This price still gives me a profit of $150,000, which is better than Bob's offer but less than my initial offer. This shows I'm open to finding a middle ground.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering a slightly higher price than Bob, I'm demonstrating that I believe the product is worth more and I'm not willing to settle for a huge loss.  
* **Pressure on Bob:**  This counteroffer puts some pressure on Bob to either agree or make another counteroffer.  He now knows I have a backup buyer who is willing to pay more.

**Next Steps:** 

* If Bob accepts this counteroffer, I'll finalize the sale.
* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll analyze his next offer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is unacceptable:** $1,100,000 is far below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  It's clear that Bob is not willing to meet me halfway, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result.
* **No room for compromise:**  This offer is so low that it indicates Bob is either not truly interested in the product or is trying to take advantage of me.
* **John provides certainty:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and eliminates any further risk or hassle with Bob.  It's the most sensible choice, ensuring I get the best possible outcome.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to maximize my profit, I am willing to accept John's offer as it provides me with a guaranteed and acceptable outcome."
