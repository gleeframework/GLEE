"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I think $16000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. How about we meet at $17000?",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $16500 is a more reasonable price for me. Can we compromise on that?",16500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $16500 is enough to reflect the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet at $17500?",17500.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to protect your interests, Alice, but I'm really close to walking away from this deal. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I think $16200 is my absolute limit. Can we meet at that price?",16200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $18000. I've already made several concessions, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one final offer: $17800. This is my last offer, so please let me know if you're interested.",17800.0,Alice,9,
