"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's price of $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $9,500 is less than Bob's maximum price of $12,000.
* **It's a good deal compared to John:**  Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price.
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice, securing the product at a good price while minimizing risk."
