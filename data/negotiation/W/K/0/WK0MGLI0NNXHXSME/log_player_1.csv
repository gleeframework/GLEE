Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired amount. $900,000 is still significantly lower than my valuation."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my desired range.  It's a good deal for me, and it seems likely that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result."
