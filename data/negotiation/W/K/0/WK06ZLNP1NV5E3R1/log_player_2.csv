"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's room to potentially get a better deal from Alice or consider buying from John as a last resort."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm very interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still within your budget of $1,500,000 and is a better price than John's offer.  While you could continue to negotiate, there is a risk that Alice might walk away or make a higher counteroffer.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a good price."
