"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $120. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is lower than Alice's perceived value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Bob needs to start with a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to demonstrate his seriousness about saving money.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $85 is still above Bob's absolute maximum of $80, leaving room for potential compromise. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is friendly and emphasizes Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. Given the value I place on this product, I would like to counter with an offer of $95. This allows us to stay within your budget while ensuring a fair return for me. Let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his $80 limit.
* **Opportunity for Better Deal:**  Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price by continuing the discussion.
* **Time Remaining:** With 7 rounds remaining, Bob has time to continue negotiating without risking the deal falling through completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $95 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $90. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Bob is increasing his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate, but staying within his budget range. 
* **Focus on Compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a price that works for both, encouraging Alice to see the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Closing the Gap:** $90 is only $5 away from Alice's last offer, signaling a desire to finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to go up to $90, Bob. I value the opportunity to work with you, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $87.50. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not There Yet:** While $87.5 is very close to Bob's $80 limit, it still exceeds it.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** With multiple rounds remaining, Bob can continue to push for a lower price.  
* **Minimal Risk:**  Rejecting the offer doesn't jeopardize the deal completely; there's still time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I value the product, $87.5 is still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to go up to $85, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal at that price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** Bob is staying within his budget but showing he is willing to compromise.
* **Finalizing the Deal:** The message emphasizes a desire to close the deal at this price point.
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:** $85 is a small concession from Alice's last offer, but still within Bob's range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. I'm glad we've narrowed down the price range. Considering the value of the product, I would like to counter with $86.50. I believe this price is fair for both parties and brings us closer to a conclusion. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** With only 3 rounds left, the negotiation is getting tight.
* **Small Margin:**  While Alice's offer is close to Bob's limit, the difference of $6.50 is still significant.
* **Guaranteed Deal:**  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his absolute maximum price, eliminating the risk of further negotiation.
* **Avoiding Overspending:**  Pushing further with Alice risks exceeding Bob's budget.

In this situation, the certainty of a deal with John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price from Alice."
