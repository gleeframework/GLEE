"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $140 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's a good deal for Alice, it's not a great deal for Bob. Bob values the product at $150, and Alice's offer is only $10 below that. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation, as Alice clearly wants to sell the product and has already indicated a willingness to negotiate.
* **Avoiding John:**  It's better to see if a better price can be negotiated with Alice before resorting to buying from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $135? Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's a better offer than the previous one, it's still above Bob's desired price. 
* **Further negotiation:**  There's still room for a compromise. 
* **Time to counter:**  Bob should counter with a price closer to his preferred $130 mark."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $135 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $132.50. I'm ready to make a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
