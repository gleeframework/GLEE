"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $100.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to make a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good idea to start with a price slightly higher than your minimum acceptable value. This gives you room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and uses language that suggests you're open to a deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** Offering $100 leaves room for Bob to counter without you feeling immediately pressured to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $80. Can we work towards that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate. I can counter with a price closer to my desired value, leaving some space for compromise.
* **Maintaining value:**  Selling to John for $120 would be a guaranteed profit, but I want to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $80 simply isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and allows us to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $95 is a compromise between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80.  
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** The message emphasizes my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Highlight value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I really appreciate your flexibility. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose $90 as my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $120. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob might walk away, and I'd be left with selling to John for $120. 
* **Opportunity cost:** While I could potentially negotiate a higher price, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting $90 is a good outcome, considering my starting point."
