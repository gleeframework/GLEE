"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. While I'm interested in the product, I'm not sure I can go that high.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500? I believe that's a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price.  How about $9,000? That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a good value for you. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm confident we can both be happy with $8,750.  This would be a win-win scenario for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $8,750 is getting closer to where I need to be. However, I'm still not quite there. To make this work for me, I need to be at $8,900.  This would be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let's meet in the middle and get this done.",8900.0,Alice,5,
