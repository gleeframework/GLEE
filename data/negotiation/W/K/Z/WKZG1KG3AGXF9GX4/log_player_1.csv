# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. While I'm interested in the product, I'm not sure I can go that high.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500? I believe that's a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.
