,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's well above your value and still leaves room for me to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price is still very beneficial to both of us, allowing you to make a substantial profit while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product and my need to stay within my price range. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
