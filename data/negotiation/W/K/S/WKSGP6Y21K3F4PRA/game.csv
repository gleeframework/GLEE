"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however,  $1,600,000 represents a significant discount already. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept that price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
