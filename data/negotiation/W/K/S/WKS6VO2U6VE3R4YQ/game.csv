"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my own valuation. ",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 may be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's worth to you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
