"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 110. How about we meet in the middle at 125? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high. How about $115?  It's closer to what I can afford, and still leaves you with a good profit.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $122 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $118.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will work for you.",118.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at 119? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to give a bit more",119.0,Alice,7,
