"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's try $1,550,000. It's a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
