"I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. Let's meet in the middle at $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $150. How does that sound?",150.0,Bob,4,
