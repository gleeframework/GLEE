# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity to sell this product to you at a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer you a better price later. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $12,500 is still above my budget.  I can get the same product from John for $10,000, making that the best option."
