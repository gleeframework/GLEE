{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the value of the product to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it is still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I will counteroffer Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  That's still a great price for a product worth so much to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a new offer of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is only $500 less than my last counteroffer and is significantly more than selling to John. It's time to close the deal."
