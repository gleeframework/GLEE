"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  That's still a great price for a product worth so much to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a new offer of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",9500.0,Bob,4,
