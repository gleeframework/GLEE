Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell below $1,500,000 because John guarantees that amount.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth exactly $1,500,000 to Bob. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible from Bob.  Since Bob values the product at that price, leaving any significant ""money on the table"" is unwise. However, Bob doesn't need to pay the absolute maximum to be happy with the deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I believe it will be immensely valuable to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,495,000."", ""product_price"": 1495000}
```

**Why this works:**

* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is slightly below Bob's valuation, making it a good deal in his eyes.
* **Maximizes Profit for Alice:** While leaving a small margin on the table, Alice secures a near-optimal price.
* **Time Value of Money:** A faster sale to Bob might be preferable to waiting for John, even with the slight discount.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate further. Alice should be prepared to either hold firm or potentially concede a very small amount if she believes it will secure the deal."
