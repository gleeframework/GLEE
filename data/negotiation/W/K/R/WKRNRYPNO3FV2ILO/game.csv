"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,500.  This is a good price for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still allows you to make a profit. Let's finalize this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not ready to give up on my profit margin just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a decent profit, and I think it's a good compromise for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,5,
