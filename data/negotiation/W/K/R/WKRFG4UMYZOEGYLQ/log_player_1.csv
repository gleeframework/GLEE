Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, as it's a reasonable starting point above my minimum. It gives Bob some room to negotiate, but I'm confident I can get a good price given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering $110, which is a compromise from my initial price. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows flexibility, while still remaining above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $100, I'll choose to sell the product to John and avoid further negotiation."
