"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. I believe this price is fair considering the value I see in the product and my willingness to close the deal quickly.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the value of the product and the potential it holds, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1500000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident I can find a similar product for that price. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This price would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to close a sale.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $1500000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm now offering the product to you for $1400000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and potential.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
