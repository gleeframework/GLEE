"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is less than Bob's maximum, it's still a significant amount. He can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500, which is $500 more than Alice's minimum acceptable price. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for both parties to compromise.  It also demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above what Bob ideally wants to pay. Bob is better off continuing to negotiate and try to get the price down further. There's still room for both parties to find a mutually agreeable price.  He has time and can always choose to buy from John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer by $250 from the previous round. This demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to his desired range. It also puts pressure on Alice to consider a deal, as she's only $250 away from her minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still too high for him to feel comfortable accepting.  The negotiation seems to be reaching a stalemate, with Alice unlikely to go lower. Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that could drag on, Bob chooses to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees him the product, albeit at a higher price, but eliminates the uncertainty and potential for further price increases in the negotiation with Alice."
