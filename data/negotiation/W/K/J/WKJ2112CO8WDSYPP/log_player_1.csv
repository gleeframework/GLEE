Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it's of great value to you, and this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, but still ensures a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While Alice could start higher, it might make Bob less willing to negotiate or even consider the offer.  A slightly lower starting point can be seen as more reasonable and encourage a deal.
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $120 from John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
