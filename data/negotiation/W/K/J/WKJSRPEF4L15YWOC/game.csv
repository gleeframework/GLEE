"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Given the value I place on this product, I'd be happy to pay $8,500. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. After considering our current situation and aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $9,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our respective positions and could be seen as a win-win solution for both of us. Please let me know if this proposal is acceptable to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
