"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from my usual price. I know it's worth $800,000 to you, so this gives you a substantial profit. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be selling it to John for $1,200,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
