,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is a fair price given the value to me and your need to sell the product. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000. This is a fair price that gives you a good return and still allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $13,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $14,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair compromise.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $14,500 is closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable going that high.  Let's split the difference and meet at $13,750.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal.",13750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $13,750. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $14,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair compromise.",14200.0,Alice,7,
