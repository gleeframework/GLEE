Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum price of $120 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  It's also below Bob's perceived value of $150, giving him an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $130.  I believe this is a fair price that gives Bob a little more room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $132 is a decent compromise and significantly better than selling to John for $120. It's likely that continuing to negotiate won't yield a significantly higher price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
