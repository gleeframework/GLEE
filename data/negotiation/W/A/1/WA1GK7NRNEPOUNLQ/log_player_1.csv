{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its true value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is strategically placed. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  This gives Bob a reason to engage, while still giving me a profit well above my minimum acceptable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I'd love to hear if you can meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a price that's significantly lower than my floor.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so that's the best option for me."
