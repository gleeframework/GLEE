{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $120, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too high to scare him off. This allows room for negotiation and hopefully gets us closer to my goal of maximizing profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price ($100), so I need to counter. While selling to John is an option, I'd like to see if I can reach a better price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $105?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider $102.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $102.5 is above my minimum acceptable price of $100 and is a good compromise.  While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, it's risky and I could end up losing the deal entirely.  It's better to secure the sale at a price that is still beneficial to me."
