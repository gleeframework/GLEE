"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's a fair offer:** It's above your minimum value of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is straightforward and gets to the point.
* **It's open to negotiation:**  The message ends with an invitation for Bob to respond, which allows for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $850,000? It's a fair price that considers both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you have more room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  Rejecting allows you to counter with a higher offer, aiming for a price closer to your initial offer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher offer:** This shows that you're willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasize the value:**  Highlighting the value the product holds for Bob reinforces the potential for him to make a profit.
* **Offer a compromise:**  Presenting $950,000 as a ""fair compromise"" positions the offer as reasonable and creates a sense of meeting halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and agree on $900,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your goal:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to your initial offer of $1,000,000.
* **Time is a factor:**  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and continuing could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Fair compromise:** Accepting the offer allows you to secure a good price while avoiding the risk of Bob walking away or you having to sell to John for a lower amount."
