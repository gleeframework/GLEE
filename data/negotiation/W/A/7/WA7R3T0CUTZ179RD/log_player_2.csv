I'm offering $105.  That's a fair price that's still within my budget.  Let's see if Alice is willing to go that low."

Alice is being stubborn, but I'm still not willing to pay her asking price. I'll try one more counteroffer, but if she rejects it, I'm going to buy from John."

Alice isn't budging, and I'm not willing to pay $130.  I'll just buy the product from John for $150.  It's more than I wanted to spend, but at least I'm getting the product."
