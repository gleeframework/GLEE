I'm offering the product to Bob at my minimum price of $1,200,000. This is the price I would get from John, so it makes sense to see if Bob is willing to pay it. If he isn't, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to maximize my profit,  $950,000 is significantly less than my minimum price of $1,200,000 and also less than John's offer. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but it's still a higher price than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be a more attractive price for Bob, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if he refuses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still lower than my minimum price, but it's getting closer. It's also higher than his previous offer and significantly higher than his initial offer. At this point, I'm concerned that if I reject his offer again, he may not come back with another counteroffer, or he may offer even less.  Since it's getting close to my minimum, it's worth accepting his offer and getting this deal done."
