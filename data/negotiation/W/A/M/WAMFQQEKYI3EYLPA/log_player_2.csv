"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is too high for Bob's budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your budget constraints.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a very competitive price considering its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has come down to $1,000,000, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should continue to negotiate to get a better price. There are still 7 rounds left, which gives Bob plenty of opportunity to try and get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my means. Let's meet halfway.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this shows my serious interest in acquiring the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I can't accept anything less than $975,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal given the product's potential for generating value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still $75,000 higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob should continue negotiating for a better price, as he has a few rounds left and can still walk away and buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your desired price, but I'm still stuck at my maximum budget of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price given our previous discussions and my clear commitment to acquiring this product.  Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
