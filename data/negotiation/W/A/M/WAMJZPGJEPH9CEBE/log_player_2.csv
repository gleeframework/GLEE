"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is starting at her own valuation of $12,000. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $10,000, there's no point in negotiating with Alice. You can save the most money by going directly to John."
