"Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While the product is interesting, that price is a little high for me. I would be willing to offer $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,400,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the movement, Alice, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That's my best offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $1,350,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
