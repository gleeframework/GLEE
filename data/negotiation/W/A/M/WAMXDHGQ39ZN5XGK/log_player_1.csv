Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $100. I think this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You are aware that the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 allows you to maximize your profit while still presenting Bob with an attractive deal. This price is significantly lower than his perceived value, making it likely he'll accept.
* **Backup Option:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $80, ensuring you don't lose out.

This strategy aims for the best-case scenario (selling to Bob at $100) while safeguarding against the worst-case (selling to John at $80)."
