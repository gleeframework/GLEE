"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price, hoping to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. I've also made it clear that I'm interested in the product, which might make her more inclined to accept a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject and try to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to my $12,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm committed to getting this product but need to stay within my budget. I can offer $14,000, which is a fair price considering my needs. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise but staying within a reasonable range. I'm also emphasizing my commitment to the product to potentially increase Alice's motivation to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,500. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above my budget, and it's clear she's not willing to go any lower. With only 5 rounds left, I'm running out of time and the risk of not getting the product at all is increasing.  It's best to take the safe option and buy from John at $12,000, ensuring I get the product within my budget."
