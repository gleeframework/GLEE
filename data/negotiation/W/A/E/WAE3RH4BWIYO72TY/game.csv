"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $12,000 to you. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000. I believe that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  However, $13,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $11,000? That's a significant price increase from my initial offer and puts us closer to a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $12,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate the concessions you've made so far. To be honest, my absolute top price is $11,500. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I might have to consider my other options.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is your top price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $12,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,7,
