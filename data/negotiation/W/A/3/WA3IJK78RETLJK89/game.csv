"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm keen on the product but $900,000 is a little steep for me. How about we settle at $700,000? It's a win-win!",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To seal the deal, I'm willing to meet you at $780,000.  This is a strong offer and a fair deal for both of us. Let's get this done!",780000.0,Bob,6,
