# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling that she's very close to her bottom line. While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a real risk she'll dig in at $795,000 or even walk away. Accepting now secures a very good price at $795,000, saving you $205,000 compared to John's offer."
