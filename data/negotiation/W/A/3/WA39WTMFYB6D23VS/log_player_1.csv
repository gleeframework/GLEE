Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get elsewhere.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000). This allows for negotiation space.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing that this is a good deal for Bob, implying there's room for him to gain if he accepts.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm reminding Bob that I have another buyer lined up, adding pressure for him to negotiate seriously.

This approach balances maximizing my profit with keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. Accepting it would result in a large financial loss.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it does show he's willing to negotiate. I can likely get a better price by counteroffering.
* **John's offer:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, which ensures I won't be left with a bad deal.  

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value, but still leaving room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's a price that I can accept."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Split the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates that I'm taking his position into account while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that the price is still a good deal for Bob, making it more appealing.

**Next Steps:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to decide whether to come down further or sell to John. However, I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've reviewed my budget and I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. While it's not ideal, it's a significant improvement from his initial offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continued negotiation may not yield a much better result, and I risk losing Bob entirely. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting this offer means a smaller profit than I hoped for, but it's still a good financial outcome and avoids the risk of losing the sale completely.

**Next Steps:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction. This ensures a solid profit while also ending the negotiation process."
