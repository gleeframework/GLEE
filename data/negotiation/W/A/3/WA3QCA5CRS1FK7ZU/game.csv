"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with an initial offer of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product is intriguing, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that the initial price was a bit steep, but I believe the product's value justifies a premium price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to increase my offer to $900,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value and your initial interest, I'm willing to make another concession. Let's aim for a price that's closer to the middle ground. I'm thinking of $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle right in the middle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my initial offer. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,7,
