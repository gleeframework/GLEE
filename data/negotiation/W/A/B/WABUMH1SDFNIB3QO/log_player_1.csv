Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $8,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $12,000 creates a potential profit of $4,000 for you ($12,000 - $8,000). This leaves Bob with a potential surplus of $3,000 ($15,000 - $12,000), making it a good deal for him and incentivizing him to accept.

By starting high, you leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
