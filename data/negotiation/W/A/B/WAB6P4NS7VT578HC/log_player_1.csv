I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the product's worth. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to lose a significant amount of money. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $750,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but $750,000 is simply not an acceptable price for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,250,000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1250000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value you mentioned earlier. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."

Round 5

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now and we're not getting close to a price that meets my minimum requirements. I've already lowered my price significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
