Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price higher than Bob's valuation ($1,000,000) but lower than your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,200,000).
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity can motivate Bob to accept the offer quickly. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message implies significant value, justifying the high price.

By offering the product at $1,150,000, you leave room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's valuation. If Bob rejects this offer, you can still sell it to John at your desired price."
