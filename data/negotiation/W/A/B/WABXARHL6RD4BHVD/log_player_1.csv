Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $14,000 is lower than Bob's estimated value of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This price allows for some give and take during the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I really like the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still far below your ideal price. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer that brings the price closer to your desired range."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $13000. I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
