Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum value of $80.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $120, so you have room to negotiate.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  A $100 offer leaves room for both of you to find a mutually agreeable price. 

Remember, the goal is to earn as much money as possible.  You'll need to assess Bob's responses and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While it would be nice to get closer to $100, accepting Bob's offer of $90 is the best choice here. It's still higher than your minimum value of $80 and you avoid the risk of a drawn-out negotiation that could lead to you having to sell to John for $80."
