"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a quick acceptance from Bob, but if not, I'm prepared to counter his offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm confident I can counter with a more appealing price and get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $128 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $128 is getting close to Bob's valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time, hoping to close the deal at a more favorable price.  If Bob still refuses, I'm ready to move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $131. This is a final offer, and it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 131} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is now very close to his own valuation, but I'm unwilling to go any lower.  At this point, it's better to sell the product to John for a guaranteed $150.  There's no point in risking more rounds of negotiation with Bob, as the chances of him coming up to my price are slim."
