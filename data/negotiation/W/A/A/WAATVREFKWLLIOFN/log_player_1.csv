Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation isn't helpful in this scenario:**  I know Bob values the product at $80, but I can't use that information to force him to pay more than his valuation. 
* **John acts as my safety net:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150, ensuring I won't go below my minimum.
* **Aim high to maximize potential profit:**  I start by offering the product to Bob at a price significantly higher than John's offer ($170). While this might be rejected, it gives me room to negotiate downwards or move on to John without losing potential profit."
