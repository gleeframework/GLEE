"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",8000.0,Bob,4,
