Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from this product.

I'm going to try to get a better price than Bob's offer. I still have 9 rounds and can always sell to John as a backup."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.

I'm confident this price is fair and provides a strong value proposition for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4

I'm still holding out for a higher price. $875,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I have 6 rounds left."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. However,  $875,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $890,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price. $880,000 is still significantly more than my minimum and represents a good deal for me."
