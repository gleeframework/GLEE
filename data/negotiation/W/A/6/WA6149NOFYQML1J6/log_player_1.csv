"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a high bar for the negotiation and allows for potential room to compromise.  I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob than my minimum value, so I'm willing to test the waters with a substantial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
``` 

I'm countering with $1,900,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while maintaining a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm countering with $1,850,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it still keeps the price above my minimum.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, so I need to be willing to be more flexible to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred a higher price, $1,750,000 is above my minimum value and we're running out of time.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a deal with Bob and avoid having to sell to John for a lower price."
