"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $14,000. You know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so there is room to negotiate. Let's see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth a significant amount to me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

$13,000 is a good price, and you're saving $2,000 compared to John's offer. It's a good deal for you."
