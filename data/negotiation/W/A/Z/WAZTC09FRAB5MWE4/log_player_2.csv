"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $6,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $5,000 is a bold move, but it shows Bob is serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if Alice isn't flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $5,500, which is a significant discount from her original offer. Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, but he also doesn't want to risk losing a good deal. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that's significantly lower than John's offer, while still leaving some room for potential negotiation in the future."
