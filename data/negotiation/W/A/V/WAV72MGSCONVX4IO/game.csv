,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, to make this deal work for me, I need to see a price closer to $1,250,000. This still provides you a significant return on the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still interested in this product but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,125,000.  This gives us both a fair deal.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
