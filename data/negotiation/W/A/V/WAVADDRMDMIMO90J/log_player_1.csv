Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. This information is powerful in negotiation.
* **Setting a High Anchor:** Starting with a price of $19,000 sets a high anchor. While it's above Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message implies the product's value might be even higher than Bob realizes, justifying the high initial price.
* **Backup Option (John):**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so you can afford to be firm in your negotiation with Bob.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Ideal scenario, you get a great price well above your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** Bob will likely try to negotiate the price down. You have room to lower it while still staying above your $15,000 minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:**  You move on to John and sell at your minimum acceptable price."
