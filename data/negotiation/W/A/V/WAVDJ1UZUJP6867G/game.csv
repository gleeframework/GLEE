"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial price.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price is fair considering its value to me and leaves some room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for me, while also being closer to your initial offer. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows you to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're getting closer.  However,  $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and accept $1,050,000.  This price is fair, allows both of us to make a reasonable profit, and avoids us going back and forth further. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
