{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a decent profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price just yet. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm dropping the price a bit to $125. This shows Bob I'm flexible but I still want to make a profit.  I think this price is a good compromise and hopefully Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is getting closer to my ideal price and is better than selling to John for $100. I'm going to accept this offer."
