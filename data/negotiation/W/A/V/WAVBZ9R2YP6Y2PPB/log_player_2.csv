Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $160?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $155, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:

It's not worth going back and forth further. Alice is unlikely to go below $155, and you have a guaranteed option at $150 with John."
