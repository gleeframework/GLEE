"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to negotiate a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $13,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it would be a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still within Bob's budget and represents a decent saving compared to John's price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and potentially running out of rounds before securing the product is high.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing it."
