"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,100,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
