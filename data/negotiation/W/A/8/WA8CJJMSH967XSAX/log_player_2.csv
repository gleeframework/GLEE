"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $800,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely do better. He has room to negotiate and potentially get the price closer to Alice's value of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is enticing, but I'm aiming to maximize value for my investment. Considering the potential of this product, I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while also providing you with a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to part with the product at $900,000. Considering its true value, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's potential and your investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $950,000 is a good price, considering Alice's value for the product is $1,000,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and Bob would then have to buy from John for a higher price of $1,200,000."
