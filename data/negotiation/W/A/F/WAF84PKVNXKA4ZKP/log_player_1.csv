"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone can help build rapport and increase the chance of a successful negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** Briefly highlighting the product's value can remind Bob of its worth.

**Strategy:** I want to maximize my profit while still leaving space for negotiation. I believe this initial offer will encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his willingness to pay and work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is significantly lower than my desired price and even below the product's value to him.  While it's tempting to take the $7,500, it's important to remember that I have multiple rounds and the option to sell to John for $10,000.  By rejecting this offer, I can continue negotiating and try to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $7,500 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm proposing $8,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement. Let me know if you're open to this offer."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial suggestion. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also shows I'm not willing to accept a low price.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the product's value to remind Bob of its worth and justify the counter-offer.
* **Compromise Language:** I use language like ""willing to compromise"" to show flexibility and encourage Bob to reconsider. 

**Strategy:**

By counter-offering at $8,500, I'm aiming to find a middle ground while still staying above Bob's perceived value. This strategy allows for further negotiation and potentially leads to a deal that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is very close to my perceived minimum value of $10,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer is the most sensible choice considering:

* **Limited Rounds:**  With only a few rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is a strong alternative, but it's not guaranteed. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and avoids potential risk.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  Bob is willing to pay close to the product's value, and this deal represents a reasonable compromise. 

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale that is close to my minimum acceptable price. This decision prioritizes a guaranteed transaction over potentially higher but less certain outcomes."
