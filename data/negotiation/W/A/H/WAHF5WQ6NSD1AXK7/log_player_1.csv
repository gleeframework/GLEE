"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love.  I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob thinks it's worth, but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Positive tone:** I'm trying to build a positive relationship with Bob, so I'm being friendly and enthusiastic. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By starting at $140, I'm leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer and for us to reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Note:** While I'm starting high, I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $150 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is too low, it does show he's interested.  I can still counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price.
* **Not rushing to John's offer:**  I still have 9 rounds left. There's no need to rush to sell to John yet, as I might be able to get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. I need to find a price that's closer to my target price but still appealing to Bob.  I'll keep in mind his offer of $100, my minimum price of $150, and the fact that I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $125? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price of $150 and Bob's offer of $100. 
* **Appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal:**  I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to work with Bob and find a fair price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for countering Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $125 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  While Bob is getting closer, there's still room for negotiation.  
* **John is a safety net:**  I still have 6 rounds left. If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. I need to find a price that's closer to my target price but still appealing to Bob. I'll consider his offer of $110, my minimum price of $150, and the fact that I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm getting closer to a price we can agree on.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $117.50 for the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 117.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a price exactly halfway between my previous offer of $125 and Bob's offer of $110. This shows good faith and willingness to compromise. 
* **Clear and concise:**  I'm keeping the message short and to the point, focusing on the price and asking for a decision.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  This price is still slightly above my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer to Bob's range. I can still sell to John if needed.

**Next Steps:**

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer. If not, I'll continue to negotiate and adjust my offers based on his responses. I'm keeping an eye on the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You drive a hard bargain Alice!  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $113.75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $113.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $113.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $113.75 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Only 4 rounds left:** With limited rounds remaining, I need to be pragmatic.  It's unlikely I'll get a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I continue to reject offers, I risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether. 

**Next Steps:**

This offer is acceptable and gets me closer to my target price.  It's a good outcome, and I've secured a sale with only 4 rounds remaining."
