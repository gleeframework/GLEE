Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to market value to proceed.  Would you consider $600,000?

While $600,000 is a significant undervaluation, I'm willing to move closer to your range to find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we consider $1,900,000?

Bob's offer:

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, he's hit his maximum budget of $800,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap between his offer and my minimum of $1,500,000.  It's time to move on to John, who's offering a price that aligns with my valuation."
