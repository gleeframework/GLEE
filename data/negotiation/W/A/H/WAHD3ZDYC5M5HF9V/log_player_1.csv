Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  It's important to remember that John is a backup option, so I can afford to be a bit more aggressive with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for less than $8,000. It's important to remember that I'm guaranteed $8,000 from John, so I can afford to be a bit more firm with Bob.  I'll counteroffer to try and get a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7,750. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's counteroffer is too low for me to accept.  It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $8,000. This ensures I won't lose out on money even if Bob doesn't come up to my desired price."
