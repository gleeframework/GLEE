"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13,000 is quite a bit over my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to offer $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make this deal happen!",9000.0,Bob,4,
