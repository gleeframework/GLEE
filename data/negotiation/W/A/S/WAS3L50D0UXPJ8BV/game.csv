,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It looks like a great product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $70 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value to you.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $85 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget. Could you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $80?  This is my final offer, as I have another buyer who is willing to pay that price.",80.0,Alice,5,
