"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $165. Would you be interested in that price?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $165 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  If that works for you, we can finalize the deal. ",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $140, but I'm willing to meet you at $155. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
