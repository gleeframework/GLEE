# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120, which is a fantastic deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While $120 is less than Alice's value, it's more than your $80 limit and you know John will sell it for $80."
