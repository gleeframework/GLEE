Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. I'm asking for $950,000, a price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you start with a strong position. Offering the product slightly below that at $950,000 aims to maximize profit.
* **Justification of value:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and stating the price ""reflects its true worth"" subtly anchors the offer in a space of high value.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offer is high, it allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, bringing the final price closer to your desired outcome. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring a successful sale."
