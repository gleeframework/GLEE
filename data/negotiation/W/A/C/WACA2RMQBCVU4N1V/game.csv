"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm happy to come down to $9,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a good deal on a valuable product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but still a touch high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. While $7,500 is closer, I still need to get a bit more for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This would be a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's aim for a win-win here.",8500.0,Alice,5,
