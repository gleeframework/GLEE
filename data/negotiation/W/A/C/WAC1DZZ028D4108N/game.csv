"Alice,  thank you for your offer. I'm definitely interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $1,025,000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high. I'm feeling more comfortable with $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000 is too low, but $1,075,000 is too high. How about $1,062,500?",1062500.0,Alice,5,
