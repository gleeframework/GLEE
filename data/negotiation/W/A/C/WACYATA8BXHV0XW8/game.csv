"Bob, it's great to connect with you about this. I'm excited to share this product with you, it's truly unique and I know it can be incredibly valuable for someone like you.

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I see its potential, $1,150,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This reflects the value I see and leaves some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,050,000 is a significant dip below what I can accept.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I believe in finding the right fit, and I value our conversation.  So, I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go while still honoring the product's worth.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position and the pressure from other potential buyers. I'm still interested in this product, but $1,120,000 is pushing my limit. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,080,000. This shows a genuine desire to close the deal and is a fair compromise. Let's find common ground.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up. I've tried to be upfront about the value here, and while other buyers are tempting, I believe in concluding negotiations fairly. I'm willing to land at $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and it reflects my desire to see this deal through with you. However, I need you to understand that this is my absolute bottom line.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
