Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) knowing that it's likely to be rejected.  This sets the stage for negotiation. My goal is to get as close to my minimum value ($1,000,000) as possible, while also leaving some room for negotiation. 

This strategy has several advantages:

* **Sets the bar high:** A high opening offer positions me as a strong seller.
* **Allows for room to compromise:** It creates space for negotiation without immediately dropping my price to a point where I'm losing out.
* **Signals my value:** The high initial price signals to Bob that I believe the product is worth a substantial amount. 

This strategy is based on the understanding that negotiation is a dance. We need to balance our desire to maximize profits with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value than my initial offer, it's still below my desired target. I believe I can push for a higher price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's last offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Moving closer to my target:** $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **Showcasing flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate and reach a compromise.
* **Still above Bob's offer:** By staying above Bob's last offer, I maintain some leverage and signal that I'm not desperate to sell at any price. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price point that's closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my minimum value of $1,000,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, the risk of further negotiation is too high. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away entirely.  

By accepting his offer, I secure a sale that is within my acceptable range and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
