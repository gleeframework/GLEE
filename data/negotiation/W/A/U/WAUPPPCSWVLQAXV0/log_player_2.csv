"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $925,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. 
* While Alice's message uses sales tactics (""exclusive opportunity"", ""take-it-or-leave-it""), it's better to stick to your budget and secure the product from John."
