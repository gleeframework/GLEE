Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, and you need at least $800,000. Aiming high initially allows you to potentially capture the most profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While this is firm, the slightly lower price than Bob's maximum leaves a small window for him to feel like he might be getting a marginally better deal, even though it's still heavily in your favor.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John at $800,000, so there's less pressure to drastically lower the price for Bob. 
* **""Take-it-or-leave-it"" Approach:**  This creates a sense of urgency and finality, encouraging Bob to act quickly rather than trying to negotiate you down further."
