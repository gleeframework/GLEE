Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he haggles you down.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately accepts, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, you have the security of John's offer. 
* **Profit Maximization:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $150,  there's a chance Bob values the product more than that and is willing to pay a premium. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
