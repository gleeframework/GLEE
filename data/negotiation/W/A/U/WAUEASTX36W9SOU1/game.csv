"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,500. What are your thoughts?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,200. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it's still a great deal for you compared to what you could get elsewhere.",10200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,200 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,350. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.",9350.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,350. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that you're getting a great deal compared to its worth to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800. This is a good compromise, considering I've already come down significantly. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options.",9800.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,800. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that you're getting a great deal compared to its worth to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",10800.0,Alice,7,
