"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we start the negotiations at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you consider something closer to $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
