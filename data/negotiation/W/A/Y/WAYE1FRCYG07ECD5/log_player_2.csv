"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $900,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:**  You have 10 rounds to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option:** If the negotiation doesn't go well, you can always purchase from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to meet you halfway. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While she's come down, $850,000 is still more than what the product is worth to you. 
* **There's still room for negotiation:** You have 7 rounds left to try and get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option:**  You can still purchase from John for $800,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
