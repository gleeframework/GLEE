Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000. It also gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer.  Accepting his offer is the best option to secure the sale quickly and ensure a good return."
