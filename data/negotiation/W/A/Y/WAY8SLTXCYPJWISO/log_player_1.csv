"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. It also sets the bar high and allows me to see how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is still above my minimum, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer. I'm hoping this signals my willingness to negotiate while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I will reject his offer and continue negotiating. While I'm willing to negotiate, I want to make sure I get a fair price for the product.  I'll keep trying to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm dropping the price again to $16,000. This is closer to Bob's offer and shows I'm serious about finding a deal. However, I'm still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to pay a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm starting to run out of time, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues the product.  I'll keep trying to find a compromise, but if the next few rounds don't yield better results, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to make one final counteroffer at $15,500.  This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it, as I don't want to risk selling to John for less.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
