Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

We are nearing the end of the negotiations, and I've reached a point where I need to decide. While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $975,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer is the best course of action to secure a deal and avoid the risk of losing out on a sale."
