"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in buying it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.**  There's no immediate gain in accepting.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better deal. 
* **John's offer is your fallback.**  If negotiations fail, you have a guaranteed option. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Alice with a lower price, leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $120?  I'm really hoping to get this product, and I think this price is fair."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower offer:** This price is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range you're willing to pay.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone can help keep the negotiation going.
* **Justification:**  Giving a reason for the counteroffer (price is a bit high) makes it feel more reasoned.

**Next Steps:**

Wait for Alice's response to your counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $135? I think that's a fair price for the quality and value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $135 is a reasonable compromise.
* **Value for money:** While you could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal altogether is increasing.  The product seems to be worth the price.
* **Limited time:**  You're already on round 3, leaving fewer opportunities to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

Accept the offer and finalize the purchase. You've secured a good deal with Alice."
