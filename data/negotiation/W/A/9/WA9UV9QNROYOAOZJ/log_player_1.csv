"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to $95, Bob's offer is within a reasonable range and  I'm nearing the halfway point of the negotiation.  It's  important to secure a deal and avoid the risk of losing the sale to John or having to continue negotiating."
