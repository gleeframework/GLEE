"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still allows me a comfortable profit. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,300,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a good profit while still giving me a significant savings compared to my alternative. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This would still leave me with a good profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
