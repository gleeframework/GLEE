{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value ($80) but not outrageous. 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly tone to establish rapport and pique Bob's interest in the product.

**Strategy:**

This strategy is a balance between maximizing profit and maintaining a good relationship with Bob.  By starting high, I leave room for negotiation while still trying to secure a good price. I'm also open to Bob's counteroffer and will adjust my strategy based on his response.  If he rejects the offer, I'll need to gauge his interest level and decide whether to keep negotiating or sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Show I'm not desperate:** This helps maintain my negotiating power.
* **Explore potential for a higher price:** I can use Bob's interest to my advantage and see if he's willing to go higher. 
* **Gain more information:**  Bob's offer reveals his perceived value of the product, which can help me determine my next counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  I maintain a friendly tone, emphasizing my willingness to negotiate while still showing that I value the product.
* **Price:** $90 is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's offer while remaining above my minimum. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer while still getting a decent price. 
* **Gauge Bob's seriousness:** If he's truly interested, he might be willing to meet me halfway.
* **Maintain leverage:** If Bob rejects, I can still choose to sell to John or continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget. Would you consider $87?  I'm ready to buy it right now if we can agree on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $87 is only $3 below my minimum price and he's clearly ready to buy now.  The negotiation has reached a point where further counteroffers are unlikely to yield a significantly higher price, and it's not worth risking losing the sale altogether. 

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, accepting $87 is the most pragmatic choice. It ensures a sale with minimal delay, and I can always try to make up for the difference with future sales."
