"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm confident this offer represents a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While meeting halfway might sound reasonable on the surface, it significantly undervalues the product's worth to both of us. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, but your offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $650,000. How about we try $1,100,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $850,000. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, $850,000 is still below my minimum. I'll counter, but I need to start steering him closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I see we're getting closer. To be completely transparent, I have another potential buyer, but I believe this product would be most valuable to you. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I need to ensure a fair return on this unique product."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your transparency about the other buyer, but I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $900,000 provides a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
