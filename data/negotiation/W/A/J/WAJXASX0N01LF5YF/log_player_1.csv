"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it.  I'm confident this product can be a valuable asset to you, and I'm open to discussing the details further if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, I'm still confident the product is worth more.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,200,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1400000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is a good offer, I still believe the product is worth more.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price. There are still several rounds remaining, and I don't want to settle for a price that is too low too early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your perspective.  While I'm open to negotiation, $1,250,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,350,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll receive.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1275000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has come up slightly, we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to see if we can close the gap further in the next few rounds.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would mean losing a considerable amount, so I'm going to continue with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm seeing that we're both committed to finding common ground. I'm going to lower my price to $1,325,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer.  Let's work together to reach a final agreement.  Time is of the essence."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where negotiations are stagnating.  Bob is unwilling to budge much further, and with only two rounds left, I don't have time to risk getting a lower price. While I'm disappointed that I can't get closer to my desired price, selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a significant profit and guarantees a sale. I'm willing to cut my losses to secure the deal."
