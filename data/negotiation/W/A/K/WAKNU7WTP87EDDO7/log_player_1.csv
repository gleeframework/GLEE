Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $2,300,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly under the product's value and my initial ask. It's time to push Bob a bit further."

Bob is now above John's offer.  It's not worth risking him walking away for a relatively small potential gain.  Better to secure the deal now at $1,550,000."
