"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This is a significant discount from your initial price and leaves room for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a deal, but $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $900,000. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in between.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $900,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. ",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $875,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $920,000. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in between.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your target price.  Let's split the difference again and go with $895,000.  This is a fair price that's within our both our ranges, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.  I'm ready to move forward if you are.",895000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $895,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $915,000. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in between.",915000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we've been going back and forth, and I'm eager to finalize this deal. I'm willing to go up to $905,000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I can afford.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.  Let's make this happen!",905000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but no lower. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",920000.0,Alice,9,
