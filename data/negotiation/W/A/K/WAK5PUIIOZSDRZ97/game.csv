"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $12,000 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $9,250? This is still a great deal for you, as it's significantly below the value you placed on the product. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,
