"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me.  How about $160?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140. Let's meet in the middle.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $140 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",145.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to save a bit more.  How about $140?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",140.0,Bob,6,
