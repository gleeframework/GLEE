"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still making a decent profit. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me.  How about $160?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and reminding Bob that it's a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's tempting to sell to him, I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $140 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm trying to reach a compromise that feels fair to both of us. I'm also highlighting the fact that this deal will leave us both happy, which can help sway Bob towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to save a bit more.  How about $140?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are in round 6, and Bob is still offering $140. This is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Although I would like to get closer to my desired price, I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Bob won't budge much further.  To guarantee a sale at a price I'm comfortable with, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
