"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer like you to take it off my hands. I'm willing to let it go for $18000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18000 is a bit more than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that offer?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of $14000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm ready to pay $10000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value I place on it and what I'm able to pay. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $12500. This is my best compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to pay a fair price. However, $12500 is still stretching my budget. I'm prepared to offer $11000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This represents my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you a price of $13000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
