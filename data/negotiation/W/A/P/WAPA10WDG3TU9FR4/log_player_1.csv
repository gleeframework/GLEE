Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but ensures I stay above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value Proposition:** The message subtly highlights the product's value, potentially swaying Bob to accept even if the price is slightly higher than his perceived worth.

**Important Considerations:**

* This assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond his product valuation.
* If time is a factor, I might adjust the price closer to $12,000 to ensure a faster sale."
