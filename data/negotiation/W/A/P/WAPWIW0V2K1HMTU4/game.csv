"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let me know if that's a starting point for us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,025,000 is still a little more than I can justify at this point.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",975000.0,Bob,4,
