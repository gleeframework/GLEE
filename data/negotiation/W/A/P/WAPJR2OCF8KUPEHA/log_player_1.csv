Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good tactic in negotiation to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product and how far apart your valuations are. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation, as you don't have to settle for a price below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum valuation, leaving no room for negotiation upwards from his side. You have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John, making Bob's offer unacceptable. Rejecting and providing a counteroffer allows you to explore if Bob might be willing to move closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its value to me. I could consider letting it go for $13,000."", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):**  We are moving closer to John's offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, the decrease is small to signal the product's value.
* **Holding Ground:**  $13,000 keeps a significant portion of the potential profit and is still considerably more than Bob initially offered.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is willing to negotiate upwards at all or if he's fixed on his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $12,500. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $12,500 exceeds your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation or potentially losing both buyers."
