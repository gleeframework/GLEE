"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe we can work together to make a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  He has 10 rounds to work with, and rejecting the offer allows him to start the counter-offering process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $8,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much as possible. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still not as low as he'd like. He's got time to continue negotiating. Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $7,750. This is a significant discount from your initial price and a fair price given the product's value. Let's try to reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 7750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $8,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $7,900. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can see the value in the product. Let's try to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has lowered her price considerably. Bob has saved $2,100 from her original offer, and the price is now just $400 above his preferred price point.  While he could continue to negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer and/or the negotiation dragging on too long means it's strategically better to accept the offer and secure the product.  Additionally, buying from John would cost him $1,000 more."
