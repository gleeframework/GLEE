{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my $1,500,000 value as possible, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if Bob proves unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction from my initial offer. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which reflects a significant discount from my original asking price. Let's see if we can close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
