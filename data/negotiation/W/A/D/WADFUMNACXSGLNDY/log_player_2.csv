Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,500?  That's still a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

Round 5
