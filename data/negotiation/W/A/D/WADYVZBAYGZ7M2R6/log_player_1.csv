"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me right now. How about we settle around $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."

``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to $1,250,000,  $1,175,000 is still a significant profit and a better deal than selling to John. It's important to remember that negotiations can be about finding a mutually agreeable price rather than maximizing profit in every single scenario."
