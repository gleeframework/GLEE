Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120.  It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$120 is a good starting point:** It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** A friendly tone can encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Highlighting value:** Reminding Bob of the product's worth can make the offer more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-offer of my own.
* If the negotiation stalls or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I will end the negotiation and sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even below my initial offer of $120.
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:**  I believe I can still secure a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **John is a safety net:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for $150, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant amount of money. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer of $120. I will aim to find a compromise that is mutually agreeable, while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my initial offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize the fairness of my offer.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  Using a friendly and positive tone helps maintain a good relationship and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer. 
* If his offers continue to be significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, I will end the negotiation and sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer to my desired price, it's not enough to justify selling at this point.
* **Opportunity for a final compromise:** I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price.  
* **John is still a safe option:** I can always sell to John for $150, which is a significantly better deal than $95.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price around $100.  I will emphasize the value of the product and the fact that this is my final offer. If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to make one last compromise.  $100 is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the true value of the product.  If you're still not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know what you decide."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  $100 is a price that I'm comfortable with, as it's closer to my desired price but still leaves a small profit margin. 
* **Emphasizing finality:**  I'm making it clear that this is my last offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a fair deal for both of us, rather than just focusing on my own needs. 
* **Mentioning alternative buyer:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other options, further encouraging him to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, the negotiation is complete, and I've sold the product for $100.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I will end the negotiation and sell the product to John for $150."
