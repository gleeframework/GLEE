"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's always wise to start by rejecting the first offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $900,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is a fair price considering I'm still getting a good deal and you're getting a quick sale. Let's see if we can agree."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $850000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum $800,000. You can continue to negotiate and try to push her price lower.  There's still room for a compromise, and you have the safety net of John's offer if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that $800,000 is a fair price that benefits both of us. This is my final offer, and if you accept it, we can finalize the deal quickly. If you reject it, I will unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of a price around $825000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You've already made your final offer and she rejected it. While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance this will turn into a long and drawn-out process. Since John is offering you the product for your maximum price, it's the most sensible option to buy from John. This saves you time and ensures you get the product within your budget."
