Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, and we can then negotiate from there.  It's important to remember that I can always fall back to John's offer of $1,200,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is still a decent amount, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground. Remember, John is always a backup option at $1,200,000."

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will get us closer to a deal and avoid the need to go through multiple rounds of negotiation."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to bridge the gap. It's important to remember that selling to John for $1,200,000 is always a viable option."

I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, aiming to show that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.  I believe this price is reasonable and could lead to a successful deal."
