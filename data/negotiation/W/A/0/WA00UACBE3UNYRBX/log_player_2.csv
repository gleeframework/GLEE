{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's in your best interest to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get Alice to come down significantly from her initial price. This is a strong starting point for negotiation, and I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a better price. This counteroffer is close to my maximum budget, but I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is still slightly above my budget, it's the closest we've gotten. At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, and buying from John would be more expensive. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product for a price that's relatively close to my maximum, and minimizes the risk of losing out."
