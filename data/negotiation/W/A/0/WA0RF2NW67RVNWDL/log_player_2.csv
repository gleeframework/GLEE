"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is your maximum, it's always good to try and negotiate.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price.  We'll see what counteroffer she makes in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount.  This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a better price. If she rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on her response in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $75, which is within my acceptable range and a good saving from her initial price.  Accepting this offer secures the product while still saving some money. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the remaining rounds."
