"Hi Bob, thanks for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer at that price.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $100. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we compromise at $102.50?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $102.50.  My budget is firm at $90, and I really don't want to go higher than that.  If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle at $95.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on the profit I want. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but only up to $98. It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",98.0,Alice,7,
