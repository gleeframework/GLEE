``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it's less than what the product is worth to him, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that we can reach a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's also likely that I won't get a better offer in the next round. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
