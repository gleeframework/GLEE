{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low.  It is still a lot less than what the product is worth to me. I am going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to increase his offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $850,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $900,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference and settle on $925,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
