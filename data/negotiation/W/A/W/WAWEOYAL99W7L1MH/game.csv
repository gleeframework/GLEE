"Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $14,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $14,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit.  I'm offering $16,500.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product. Let's find a compromise!",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're able to accept.",15500.0,Bob,4,
