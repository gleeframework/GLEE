"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I believe it's worth a lot to the right person.  I'm starting with an offer of $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8000 for it. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Accepting this offer ensures I don't lose out on the deal and get the guaranteed value of $8,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing."
