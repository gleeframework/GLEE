"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $150 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $80. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $150 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120 to make this work.  This is still a good deal for you, as you mentioned the product is worth $80 to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get a better price. There's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price."
