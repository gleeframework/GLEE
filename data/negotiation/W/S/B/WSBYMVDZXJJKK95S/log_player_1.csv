Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but  $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?"", ""product_price"": 1225000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $1,225,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to accept $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

``` 
While I could push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him as a buyer.
