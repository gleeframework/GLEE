,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I understand its value, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000? I believe this might be closer to what we can agree upon.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm eager to make this work, $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe that reflects the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my financial situation, I can't commit to $1,100,000. Could we possibly aim for $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
