Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

This is your maximum budget.  Let's see if Alice is willing to come down to that price."

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to our budget."

Let's try a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant decrease from Alice's last offer, and hopefully, it's a price she's more willing to consider."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to our budget, it's still higher than what we're comfortable with. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Let's see if we can meet in the middle with a final offer of $1,100,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us."
