"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $130. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. How about $140? I think that's a fair compromise and a good value for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $152. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",152.0,Alice,5,
