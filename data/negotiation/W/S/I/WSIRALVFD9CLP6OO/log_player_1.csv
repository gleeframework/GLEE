Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I believe this gives Bob a good incentive to buy, while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that might entice Bob to accept."
