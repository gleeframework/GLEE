"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand it's a bit higher than what you're willing to pay, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $105. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not quite comfortable going that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $97. I can offer it to you for $101. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",101.0,Alice,5,
