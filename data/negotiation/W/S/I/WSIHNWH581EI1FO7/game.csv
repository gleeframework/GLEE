"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for something worth at least $120 to me. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108. Let's meet in the middle.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $112. It's a fair compromise and I'm confident it's a good value for you.  What do you say?",112.0,Alice,5,
