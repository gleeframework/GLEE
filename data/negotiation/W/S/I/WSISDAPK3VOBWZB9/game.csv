"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is $8,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. How about we settle on $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my final offer. If you can't accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, which is $10,000. I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to you. How about we settle on $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
