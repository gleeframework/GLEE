"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to find a compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see you're being flexible.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make it happen!",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go below $10,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it reflects my desire to reach a deal with you.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's work together to close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $10,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford right now. I'm willing to offer you $9,750. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground. I can't go as low as $9,750, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,875. This is a good compromise, and it gets us closer to a final deal. What do you say?",9875.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $9,875 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal. I'm willing to offer $9,800. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us very close to a final agreement.  Let's make this happen!",9800.0,Bob,8,
