"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the value it holds."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum, I'm aiming to set a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's worth and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price provides ample room for negotiation and allows me to make concessions gradually. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level and negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is better than our guaranteed sale to John, but it's still significantly below our product's worth to us. We have room to negotiate, and his counter-offer suggests he's interested."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your perspective on the market, the value this product represents is considerably higher than your initial offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price point acknowledges the product's true worth while still providing significant value for you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession from my initial price to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Staying Above John's Offer:** It's crucial to remain above John's offer of $1,000,000. This ensures that even with further concessions, I can still secure a better deal with Bob. 
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's unique value, I'm subtly pushing back against Bob's market value argument and reinforcing the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while also being more in line with my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer! Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated to buy. While his current offer is still below our target, we have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. It's too early to settle for John's offer when there's still a good chance of getting a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your budget considerations. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,075,000?  This reflects my desire to make a deal while acknowledging the inherent value of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is a clear attempt to find the midpoint between our previous positions.  It signals flexibility on my part while still pushing for a price significantly above Bob's last offer.
* **Urgency and Deal Focus:** By phrasing it as ""Let's find a middle ground"" and ""make a deal,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency and a desire to conclude the negotiation soon.
* **Staying Above John:**  Crucially, this offer still keeps me comfortably above my safety net of John's $1,000,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss $1,025,000? I believe this price is a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal! Bob is now offering more than John's $1,000,000. While we could push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away altogether. Accepting now secures a strong profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
