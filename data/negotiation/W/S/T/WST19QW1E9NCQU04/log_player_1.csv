``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it still allows room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation. I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the value of the product and expressing confidence in a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Could you do $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  I'm not willing to accept such a large loss.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While I can't go as low as $900,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would still be a very good deal for you, considering the product's value, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm eager to make a deal with Bob, $950,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer again, trying to inch closer to a compromise."

This would still be a very good deal for you, and it's the best I can offer at this point. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
