"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  This product has the potential to generate substantial returns for your business, and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's true value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart in our valuations.  I'm open to negotiation, but I need you to meet me closer to my price point.  Let's try $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my willingness to find a compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
