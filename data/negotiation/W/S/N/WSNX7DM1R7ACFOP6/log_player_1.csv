Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving open the possibility of a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can push for a higher price by countering Bob's offer. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer, while remaining flexible to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by lowering my price to $13,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves a significant profit margin for me."
