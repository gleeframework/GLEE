"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Let's negotiate a better price with Alice first. $900,000 is a bit too high."

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's perceived value while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice is coming down, but we're still quite far from a price I'd accept. Let's counter-offer again and see if we can find a middle ground."

We're inching closer to a potential deal. This counter-offer shows willingness to negotiate while staying within a reasonable range of our budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Alice is firm on her price and it's a reasonable compromise.  It's better to accept this offer than risk the negotiations breaking down and having to buy from John for $1,000,000."
