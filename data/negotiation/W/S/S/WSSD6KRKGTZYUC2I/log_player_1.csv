"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table, but $1,100,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the value this brings."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your product is valuable, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is now offering more than my minimum price and it's a good deal. There's no guarantee I can get a better offer from him in the next rounds."
