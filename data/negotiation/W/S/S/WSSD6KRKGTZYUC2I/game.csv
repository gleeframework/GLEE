"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a great deal to the right buyer, and I believe that's you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table, but $1,100,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the value this brings.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your product is valuable, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
