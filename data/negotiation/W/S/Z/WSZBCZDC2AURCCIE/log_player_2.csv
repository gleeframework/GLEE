"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  It's too high, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  He also has the option of buying from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $9,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $10,500, the product is still within his budget, and he is saving $500 compared to buying from John.  There's no guarantee he can negotiate a lower price, and he risks losing the deal entirely."
