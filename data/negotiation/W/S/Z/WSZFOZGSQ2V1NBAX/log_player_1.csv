Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal.  I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This offer stands before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting other interested parties (even if not explicitly John) adds a time pressure element to encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,450,000 is a significant price that still leaves a substantial profit margin. It's high enough to be taken seriously but leaves room for Bob to see value compared to his perceived $1,000,000 worth.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, further back-and-forth negotiation might occur depending on Bob's response."
