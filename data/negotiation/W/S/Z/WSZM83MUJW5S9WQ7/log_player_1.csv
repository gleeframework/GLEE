{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $120, but I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high, at $120, knowing Bob values it at $80. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize potential profit.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the product's value to Bob. I also emphasize my willingness to negotiate, which is crucial to keep him engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $100. 
* **Moving to the next round:** I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm confident Bob will continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $105, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Message:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone, acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing willingness to compromise. I also ask for his feedback, keeping the conversation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $97.50 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to get at least $100.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. $97.50 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $102.50. It's a fair compromise, and it would be a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $102.50.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still above my minimum and closer to Bob's last offer. 
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the ""fair compromise"" aspect, emphasizing the potential win-win scenario.  I also reiterate my desire for a mutually beneficial deal, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $102.50, which would be $96.25. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 4 rounds remaining, the price is still below my minimum of $100.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob won't budge further and I'll end up with less than I'd like.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit, and I have no reason to risk losing out on that."
