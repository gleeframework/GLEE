Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you still make a profit.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This keeps the negotiation open and allows for a potential win-win situation. 

Remember, my goal is to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep the negotiation going, and potentially secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I can still sell to John for $10,000 if I can't get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a fair deal.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 8500}
