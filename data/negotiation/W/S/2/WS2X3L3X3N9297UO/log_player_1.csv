{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal and I think you'll really appreciate it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer sets a price point above your minimum but below what you know the product is worth to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation while still giving you a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below the value I want to achieve. I believe I can still get closer to my target price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can agree on that."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and the price you're willing to sell it for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $110, $105 is a good compromise. It's a decent profit for me, and it seems like Bob is firm on his offer.  It's better than selling to John and risking that he gets a better deal elsewhere."
