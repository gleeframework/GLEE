# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high.  Bob should reject and counter-offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. This product has significant potential, and I believe its true value is much higher. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This would still be a great deal for you.

While $1,700,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than he's comfortable with. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
