"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. While I'm interested in the product, I can only offer $1,300,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. This product has significant potential, and I believe its true value is much higher. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This would still be a great deal for you.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects the product's value.  Let's reach an agreement so we can both benefit from this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
