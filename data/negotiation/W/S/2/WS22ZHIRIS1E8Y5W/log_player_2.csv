Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your offer, it's significantly lower than my target.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,200,000 is my lowest counteroffer.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and willingness to meet me halfway.  While I want to make this work,  $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This offer is a fair middle ground, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, her offer of $1,250,000 is still too high for you. You have 5 more rounds to negotiate a lower price and are still in a better position than buying from John.  Continuing to counteroffer is the best option to try and reach a more favorable price."
