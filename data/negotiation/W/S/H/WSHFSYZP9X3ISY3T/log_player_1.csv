"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This sets a strong starting point for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in this price range.  If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of where his value lies."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm offering $950,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a price that's closer to my ideal.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will incentivize Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to secure a better price. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can bridge the gap. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping that it will be enough to get Bob to accept.  I've reduced my price twice already, and I'm nearing my minimum. I'm ready to close the deal, but I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $820,000 is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I have a few rounds left, and I still believe there's room for a better price. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm not ready to settle for the bare minimum yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm offering $875,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping that it will be enough to get Bob to accept. I'm nearing my minimum, but I'm not ready to sell to John for $800,000 yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to meet Bob halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $800,000.  We're down to the final two rounds, and Bob's offer of $810,000 is only slightly better than John's offer.  I don't want to risk going through another round and potentially ending up with nothing.  It's time to secure a guaranteed sale."
