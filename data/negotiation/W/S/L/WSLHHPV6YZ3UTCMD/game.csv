"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $95 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's still a great price for this product, and I think it's fair for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $90. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? ",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $87.50 is still a little low for me.  Let's try $89.  It's a fair price for a great product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",89.0,Alice,5,
