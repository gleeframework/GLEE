Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $800000 on this purchase. Would you consider reducing the price?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there.  I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially losing the deal.  I'll take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
