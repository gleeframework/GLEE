"Alice, your product sounds great, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $13,000. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $12,500 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I think the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we meet at $12,750? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",12750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're holding firm at $12,750, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.  Let's make this happen!",12250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,000. I think the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. How about we meet at $12,900? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",12900.0,Alice,7,
