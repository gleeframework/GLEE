It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $105. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $112.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $112.50 is closer to your ideal price, you can still try to negotiate a bit lower.  You're still within your budget and there are rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still aiming to stay under $110. Would you consider $107.50?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about staying under $110. I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can sell the product to you for $109.50. It's a good compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $109.50, which is still within your budget and very close to your ideal price. There are still rounds left, but it's unlikely you'll be able to get it for significantly less. Accepting this offer is the most strategic move at this point."
