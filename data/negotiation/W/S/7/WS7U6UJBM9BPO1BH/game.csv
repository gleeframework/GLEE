"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be able to lower the price to $100? I believe this would still provide a good value for the product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $115. Let's meet in the middle at $110. This still gives you a good deal, and it works for me.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $95 as the price for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle and allows us to reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise at $105. This price is a good balance between our needs and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
