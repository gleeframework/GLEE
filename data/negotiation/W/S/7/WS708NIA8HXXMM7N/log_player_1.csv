"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm starting the offer at $110, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $100 to me.  Bob may find this price too high, but I want to see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is more than the product is worth to Bob, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to get closer to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm not confident that we'll be able to reach a deal that benefits me.  Therefore, I'm going to take the guaranteed $100 from John."
