{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant profit for me while still being below Bob's perceived value.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. Hopefully, he'll see the value in my product and be willing to pay this price."
