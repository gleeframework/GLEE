"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $8,000 to Alice and $12,000 to Bob. Alice's offer of $10,000 is a good deal, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise - it's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's value of $8,000.  This gives Alice room to accept without feeling like she's getting a bad deal, while also saving Bob some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good deal, considering Bob's maximum budget of $12,000 and the product's value to him. Accepting the offer saves Bob $2,500 compared to buying from John, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a broken deal."
