Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I believe it's worth significantly more than that, but I'm offering you this price as a special deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $120.  Offering it slightly below his valuation maximizes the chance of him accepting while still securing a good profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a fallback buyer (John) at $80, ensuring you won't go below your minimum. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **Psychology:** The message hints at the product's higher value and positions the offer as a ""special deal,"" potentially making Bob more inclined to accept."
