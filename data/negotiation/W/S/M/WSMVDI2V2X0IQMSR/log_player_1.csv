""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is below my acceptable range. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",

Round 4

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we still have room to negotiate and we're aiming for the highest possible profit. We're not in a desperate situation yet to accept his current offer or John's backup offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $1,080,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly committed to buying and is incrementally increasing his offer. While we could potentially squeeze a bit more, accepting at $1,080,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of Bob dropping out in later rounds."
