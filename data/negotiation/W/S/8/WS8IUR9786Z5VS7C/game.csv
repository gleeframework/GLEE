"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which still leaves you with a healthy profit. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a significant advantage, and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects the value of the product for you while ensuring I can reach my desired outcome. Let's close this deal now.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
