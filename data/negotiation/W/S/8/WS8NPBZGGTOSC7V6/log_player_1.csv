Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm confident in the value of my product, and I believe it's worth more than $8,000 to him, but I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still slightly lower than my minimum, it's very close to my minimum threshold.  It's more than I would get selling to John, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go any higher. I'm choosing to end the negotiation here."
