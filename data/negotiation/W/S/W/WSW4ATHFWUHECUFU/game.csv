"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Let's meet in the middle at $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be open to $760,000?  I believe that's a fair offer.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $760,000, which is $792,500. What do you think?",792500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $780,000? It's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you agree.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"I like your enthusiasm, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $780,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $792,500 and $780,000, which is $786,250. What do you think?",786250.0,Alice,7,
