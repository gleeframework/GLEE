Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (optional):** Starting a bit lower than $120 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob, still landing within a profitable range for me. 
* **Secure a Deal:** Offering a price slightly below his perceived value increases the likelihood of Bob accepting, avoiding the need to sell to John for $100."
