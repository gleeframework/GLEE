""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John who will buy it for $10,000, ensuring we don't go below our minimum. 

By offering the product at $14,000, we leave some room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above our minimum. This price point is likely to be attractive to Bob, as it saves him $1,000 on his perceived value."
