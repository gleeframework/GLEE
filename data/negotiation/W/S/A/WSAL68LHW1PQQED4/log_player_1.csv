{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob seems stuck on $1,050,000. It's time to push back more firmly and signal that he's reaching the limit of my flexibility. I'm still far from my minimum and have room to negotiate, but I need to see more movement from him."

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has budged slightly upward, and while it's not my ideal price, it's a solid offer above my minimum. Accepting now secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of the deal falling through in the remaining rounds. It's always better to walk away with a good deal than risk losing it all for a slightly better one."
