"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive message encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not asking for the full $150 right away, as it's likely Bob will counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in subsequent rounds.
* **John is a backup:**  I know John is willing to pay $150, which gives me a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Meeting halfway (ish):** $115 is closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial offer, and closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Continuing the conversation:** Using a friendly tone encourages further dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I'm confident that I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, given his willingness to increase his offer. 
* **John's offer is a strong backup:**  Having John as a buyer for $150 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $110, but that's still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $112? It's a small difference, and we can both walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  $112 is a small step up from Bob's offer, showing my willingness to be flexible, but still higher than his offer.
* **Finality:**  By suggesting this is a ""compromise"" and that both can ""walk away happy,"" I'm subtly implying that this could be my final offer.
* **Minimizing risk:**  If Bob accepts, I'm getting closer to my desired price. If he rejects, I still have John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still not comfortable with $112. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below minimum:**  $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation stalled:**  Bob is showing signs of walking away and his counteroffers are getting progressively smaller.
* **John's offer is secure:**  John's offer of $150 is a guaranteed profit and a better deal than selling to Bob at this point.
* **Time pressure:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing John as a buyer. 

Selling to John is the best option to ensure a profit and maximize my earnings within the remaining rounds."
