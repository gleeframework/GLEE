"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me halfway?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $110, but that's still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $112? It's a small difference, and we can both walk away happy with the deal.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still not comfortable with $112. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,6,
