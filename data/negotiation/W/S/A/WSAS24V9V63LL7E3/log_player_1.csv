Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This gives Bob a little room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a profit. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay at least $80, as that's what the product is worth to him, so this offer gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm confident I can get a better deal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $85. This is a compromise between my desired price of $90 and Bob's offer of $75. It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a fair agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  While Bob's offer of $78 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I consider acceptable.  John is a sure bet for $80, which guarantees me a fair price and avoids any further negotiation."
