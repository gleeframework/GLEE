Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with my absolute minimum price, knowing that I have a backup buyer in John. This puts the pressure on Bob to make a counteroffer if he's serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm dropping my price slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at the maximum value he's willing to pay, which is better than my backup option of selling to John for $1,200,000.  It's a good deal for me, and it's likely that if I reject, he won't increase his offer again."
