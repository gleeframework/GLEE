{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $150 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can do $132, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $132, which is within your budget and a good compromise. It's unlikely you'll get a lower price from Alice, and buying from John would cost you more. It's time to accept the offer."
