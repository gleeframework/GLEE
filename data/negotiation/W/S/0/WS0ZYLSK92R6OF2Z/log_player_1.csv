Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my target price of $1,000,000. While I know the product is worth less to Bob, I'm hoping to maximize my profit and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if it's better to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my target, it's still below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this is a sweet spot that Bob will find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still slightly below my ideal price, it's very close and continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of losing him as a buyer.  It's also better than selling to John for $1,000,000, as it's a quicker and more efficient deal."
