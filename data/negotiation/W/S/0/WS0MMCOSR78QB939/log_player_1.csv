Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth, justifying the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is open and invites Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you mention you have another buyer, it's not presented as a threat. This keeps the conversation collaborative.

By offering the product at $15,000, Alice gives herself a chance to earn an extra $3,000. If Bob rejects the offer, she can still fall back on John's $12,000 offer."
