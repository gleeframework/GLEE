"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. Alice's initial offer is exactly that price. While there's no immediate downside to rejecting the offer, there's also no upside. You're not going to get a better deal from Alice, and John is offering the same price.  So, you might as well buy from John and avoid the hassle of negotiating further."
