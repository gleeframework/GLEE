# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her perceived value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can do better by rejecting this offer and seeing if Alice will come down further or going with John's offer."
