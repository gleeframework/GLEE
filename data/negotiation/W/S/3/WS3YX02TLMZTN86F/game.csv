"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $9500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10800. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $10800. How about $10150?",10150.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10150. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10800, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,7,
