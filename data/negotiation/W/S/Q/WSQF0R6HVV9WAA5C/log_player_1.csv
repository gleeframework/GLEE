Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I see the value $11,000 represents, the product is a significant investment on my end and that price wouldn't be feasible for me. Could you do $17,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product is a significant investment for you, but $17,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could you meet me halfway at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Taking $14,000 is a good deal at this stage. While holding out for a higher offer from Bob or taking John's offer are possibilities, they're riskier: 

* **Bob's Motivation:**  Bob's offer jumping to $14,000 suggests he's quite interested. However, there's no guarantee he'll go much higher, especially knowing John exists as an option for you.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the negotiation becomes riskier. Accepting a sure $14,000 now is safer than potentially getting stuck later with a worse outcome."
