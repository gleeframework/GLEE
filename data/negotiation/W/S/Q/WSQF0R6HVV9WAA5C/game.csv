"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I see the value $11,000 represents, the product is a significant investment on my end and that price wouldn't be feasible for me. Could you do $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
