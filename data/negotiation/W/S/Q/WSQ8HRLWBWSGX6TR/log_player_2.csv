{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily negotiating down Alice's price but is getting closer to his own maximum budget.  While there's still room to negotiate, with only a few rounds remaining, it's becoming more likely that the final price will be above Bob's preferred maximum.  

Since John is willing to sell the product for Bob's maximum price, it makes sense to buy the product from John and secure the best deal possible within the given timeframe."
