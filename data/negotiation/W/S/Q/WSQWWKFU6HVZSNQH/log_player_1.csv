Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's a great deal and will be valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** John provides a safety net at $100.

By offering the product at $119, you maximize your potential profit while staying below Bob's perceived value. This leaves Bob with a small gain ($1) and incentivizes him to accept the offer rather than risk losing out entirely. If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
