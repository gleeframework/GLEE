Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** While you value the product at $150 and Bob values it at $80, offering it at $125 attempts to find a price point that's potentially acceptable to both parties. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have the security of John's offer ($150) if Bob rejects your proposal, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a low price."
