"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $11,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product, hoping to sway Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick deal at a price close to my desired value. However, I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's counteroffer is low, it shows he's interested in the product.  There's still room for negotiation. 
* **Time to Counter:** I have 9 rounds left, so I can afford to continue negotiating. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value, aiming for a compromise. If he remains unwilling to meet my expectations, I'll have the option to sell to John in later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further.  How about $10,500? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob, emphasizing that $10,500 is still a good deal.
* **Open for Discussion:**  I'm using a question at the end to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on. I'm aiming for a quick resolution but am prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  It's a good outcome considering Bob's initial offer.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While I could try to negotiate further, it's risky. Bob might refuse my counteroffer, and I'm already down to 6 rounds. 
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting the offer ensures a sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities.

**Strategy:**

I'm prioritizing a quick and relatively profitable sale.  While I could potentially get a higher price, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower profit outweighs the potential gains."
