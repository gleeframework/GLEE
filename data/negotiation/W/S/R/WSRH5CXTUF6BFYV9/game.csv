"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to meet you at $13500. I'm willing to make a counteroffer to you: I'll sell the product to you for $14500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $13750. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price?",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're still interested in the product, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go up to $13750. I'm willing to make another counteroffer to you: I'll sell the product to you for $14200. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. If you're still interested, I'm willing to discuss further.",14200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go above $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $13100. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to stay within my budget.",13100.0,Bob,6,
