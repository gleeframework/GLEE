Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a valuable item, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $16,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth that investment."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,500. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $15,500 is a good price and it's better than selling to John for $15,000.  I'm happy to close the deal now."
