"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  There's room for negotiation as the product is worth $8,000 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. This would still be a good profit for you, and it's the best I can do at the moment."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $9,200 to make it worth my while. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $9,200 is a lower price than John's $10,000, so buying from Alice is more advantageous in terms of saving money.
* **Counteroffering risks further negotiation:**  Counteroffering again might lead to more back-and-forth, and potentially Alice could end up offering a price closer to John's, or even reject Bob's offer.
* **A reasonable compromise:**  $9,200 is a compromise between Bob's previous counteroffer and Alice's original offer, which seems like a fair price to end the negotiation."
