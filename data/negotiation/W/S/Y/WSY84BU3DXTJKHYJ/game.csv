"I appreciate the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. This would still be a good profit for you, and it's the best I can do at the moment.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $9,200 to make it worth my while. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",9200.0,Alice,3,
