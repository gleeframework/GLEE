"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $125. This is my best price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $112.50.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $112.50 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $118 is my absolute minimum. This is a great product, and I think it's worth every penny.",118.0,Alice,5,
