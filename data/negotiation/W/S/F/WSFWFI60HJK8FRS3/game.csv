"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering your value for it and allows for a good profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
