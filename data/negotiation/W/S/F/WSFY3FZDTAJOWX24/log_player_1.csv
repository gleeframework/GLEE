"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $1,750,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to set a positive atmosphere for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your generosity, but I am only able to pay up to $1500000 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting Bob's offer would mean I'm selling the product for my minimum, leaving no room for profit.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I still have several rounds to work with. There's a chance I can get a higher price.
* **John's Offer:** While John is offering my minimum price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to make this deal happen.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly increasing his desire to close the deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and focused on finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1550000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While Bob is offering a slightly higher price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to my desired price.  There's still room for further negotiation.
* **John's Offer:**  Although John offers my minimum price,  I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your offer, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,575,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product at a good price and me to get closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 1575000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between our last two offers, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Win-Win Focus:** I'm framing the proposal as a win-win for both of us, highlighting the benefits of the deal for Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in negotiating, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $1562500 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,562,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,562,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price,  $1,562,500 is still below my desired value.
* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob is showing a clear intention to close the deal, and we're getting closer.  There's a good chance I can secure a higher price with a few more rounds of negotiation.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is still a good backup, but I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob if I continue negotiating. I have 4 rounds remaining, which gives me enough time to potentially achieve a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a compromise.  Your offer is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart. Let's try $1,568,750. This is a small step closer to your offer and a significant step toward making this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1568750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Step:**  I'm offering a small increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Emphasis on Progress:** I'm highlighting how this offer represents progress toward a deal, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and encouraging to maintain a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your patience and flexibility, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $1566250 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,566,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,566,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,566,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is my minimum, I'm not guaranteed he'll still be available in the next round, and there's no guarantee of getting a better price from Bob. 

Therefore, accepting this offer is the most sensible decision, securing a good price for the product and ensuring a sale."
