# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

While $13,000 is less than Alice's value, it's significantly more than your $8,000 limit and what John is offering. You can save money by rejecting this offer."
