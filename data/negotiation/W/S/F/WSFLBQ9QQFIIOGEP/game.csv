"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiations.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $800,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $700,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $650,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",650000.0,Alice,5,
