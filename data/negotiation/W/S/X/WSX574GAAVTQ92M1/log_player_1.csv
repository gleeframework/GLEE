{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is consistently moving upwards, and we're getting close to the point where the gains from further negotiation might be minimal. Accepting $1,390,000 ensures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
