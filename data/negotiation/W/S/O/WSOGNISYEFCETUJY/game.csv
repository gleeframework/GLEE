"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $130 for it. This offer includes a limited-time discount, making it an excellent opportunity for you.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in your product, and I'd be happy to purchase it for $115. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on it.",115.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to consider a price of $125 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while providing you with a competitive price compared to the value you see in it.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $125 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  This price is fair considering the value I place on the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you.",120.0,Bob,4,
