"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've invested in negotiating. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $790,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $790,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to reach a slightly higher figure. How about we settle on $810,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,7,
