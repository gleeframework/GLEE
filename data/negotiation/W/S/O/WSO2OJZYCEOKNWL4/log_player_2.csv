"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to us and we believe it's equally valuable to you. Considering its quality and benefits, I'd like to propose an offer of $110 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $110 is better than John's price of $120, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He's proposing a price that's $10 lower than Alice's initial offer, which shows he's serious about getting a good deal. This counteroffer is still within his budget, but it's low enough to potentially make Alice reconsider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $105 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, accepting this offer at $105 is a good compromise.  It saves him $15 compared to John's price and gets him the product.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
