"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,100,000. This is above Bob's value of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit while still leaving room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $1,050,000. This is still above Bob's value but represents a significant decrease from my initial offer. My goal is to find a price point that is acceptable to both of us. This strategy balances my desire to maximize profits with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not high enough.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can push the price higher. I believe there's still room for compromise, and I don't want to miss out on the possibility of a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $1,000,000. This is a significant concession, but I believe it's necessary to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.  This price is still higher than Bob's initial valuation but demonstrates my willingness to compromise. I'm hoping that this offer will be enticing enough for him to accept. If not, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. With only four rounds remaining, I don't think I have enough time to push the price higher. Given that I can sell to John for $1,200,000, it's more beneficial to secure that deal now."
