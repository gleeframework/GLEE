Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to get at least $120 for this product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unwilling to go below her value of $120.  While she might eventually come down a little further, it's unlikely she'll go as low as $100.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price."
