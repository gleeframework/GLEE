Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize profit. 
* **Openness:**  I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to negotiate to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm suggesting the product is ""amazing"" to subtly hint at its potential value to Bob, without explicitly stating it. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget while keeping my options open to either negotiate further or sell to John if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than my absolute minimum ($100), it's still below my desired starting point. Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Negotiate further:** I can counter with a price closer to my initial asking price, aiming for a compromise.
* **Test Bob's commitment:**  By rejecting his initial offer, I can gauge his true interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Potentially secure a better price:**  If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to increase his offer to close the deal.

I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $100 because I believe there's potential to get a better price from Bob through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $135?  It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by meeting him halfway between my initial price ($150) and his offer ($120).
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing that $135 is still a good deal for both of us, subtly reinforcing the value of the product.
* **Clarity:** I'm being clear and concise in my counteroffer, avoiding ambiguity or unnecessary details.

This counteroffer gives Bob an opportunity to accept a price closer to my desired range while still appearing reasonable and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 below my previous counteroffer of $135. This is a significant improvement over his initial offer of $120 and puts me close to my desired profit margin.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but there's also the risk of Bob walking away or getting frustrated.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit that is considerably higher than selling to John.
* **Time is Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation might not be worth the potential extra $5, especially if there are other potential buyers waiting.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that meets my minimum profit requirement while minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
