"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  My asking price is $1000000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its potential worth.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return.  If this price isn't right for you, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it for $800000.  Please let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
