"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and enthusiastic to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference at $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love this product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's. I'm also trying to maintain a positive tone and reiterate the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price at $125. How about we try $115? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I really want to get the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is a significant drop from my initial price, I'm still not willing to sell for that low.  I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but let's meet at $120.  That's a fair compromise and I'm sure you'll be happy with this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that is closer to my minimum price point while also showing flexibility to Bob.  I'm emphasizing fairness and reiterate the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $120 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer, so how about we try $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is only slightly lower than my last counteroffer, I'm not willing to go that low yet.  I believe we can still reach an agreement closer to my minimum price point. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find the best price, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy, and I'm confident you'll love this product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that is closer to my minimum price point while also showing flexibility to Bob.  I'm emphasizing fairness and reiterate the product's value and that we're nearing the end of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'll meet you halfway from your original offer, so how about we try $105? I think that's the best price we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price, but it's still below my desired price point.  It's getting too risky to keep negotiating with Bob, as I'm running out of rounds and might end up with a price I'm not comfortable with.  Selling to John for $100 is the safest option to ensure I make a profit and don't waste more time."
