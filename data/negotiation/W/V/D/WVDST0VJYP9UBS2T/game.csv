"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I believe this price reflects its worth and provides you with a solid return on your investment. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2000000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1500000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects the value I place on the product and offers a reasonable compromise for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still find the $1750000 price point too high for my current budget. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $1600000? I believe this would better align with the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
