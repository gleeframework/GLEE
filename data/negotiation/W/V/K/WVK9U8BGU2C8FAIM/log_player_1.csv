"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a substantial profit.  While I don't know Bob's perceived value, this initial offer sets a high bar and gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm rejecting it and will counteroffer in the next round.  I still have time and opportunities to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly but still maintaining a strong negotiating position. My goal is to meet somewhere in the middle, but I'm not willing to settle for anything significantly less than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I still have some room to negotiate. I'm hoping to get a bit more by rejecting this offer and counteroffering in the next round.  I'm also aware that I have the option of selling to John for $800,000, which is a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still trying to get as close to my minimum value as possible. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to settle for anything below $800,000. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer finally meets my minimum value of $800,000. It's a good outcome, and I'm happy to accept it. While I could try for a higher price, I'm not sure if Bob will go any further. There's always a risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting his offer guarantees me the desired amount and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
