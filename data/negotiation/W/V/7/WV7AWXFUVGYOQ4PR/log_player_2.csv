(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, it's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get an even better price."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $56. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $56
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While it's tempting to continue negotiating, you've already rejected several offers and the price is getting closer to your limit.  Accepting Alice's offer at $56 is still a good deal compared to buying from John, and it secures the product. You have time to try to negotiate further, but there's a risk Alice will raise her price, or the negotiation will drag on with no clear outcome."
