"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still gives you a significant value, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
