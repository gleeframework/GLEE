Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,400,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still giving me a significant profit. 
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I've highlighted the value of the product to Bob, making him more likely to consider a higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've explicitly stated I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us, showing flexibility and encouraging a positive negotiation.

This strategy aims to secure a good price while maintaining a respectful and collaborative tone with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,200,000 is still profitable for me, it's significantly lower than my starting offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate. I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial price. 
* **Avoiding a quick sale:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safe option, but I'm aiming for a higher profit.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still gives you a significant value, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:** I'm not simply accepting Bob's offer. Instead, I'm meeting him halfway by reducing my price from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also signals I value the product. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I've again emphasized the value the product brings to Bob, reminding him of the significant benefit he'll receive.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  My message still indicates openness to reaching an agreement. This keeps the door open for continued negotiations. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and maintaining a positive and collaborative tone."
