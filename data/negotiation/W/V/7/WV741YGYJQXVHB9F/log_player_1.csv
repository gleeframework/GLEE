Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a stronger starting position. 
* **Positive messaging:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm acknowledging the possibility of negotiation by asking Bob what he thinks. This shows flexibility and encourages him to counteroffer.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is still more than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I want to try to squeeze out a bit more value from Bob. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to sell at this price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a compromise that meets halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Empathy:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints to maintain a positive tone and show understanding.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that $8,500 is a ""fair price"" for both of us, further encouraging Bob to accept. 

By staying firm but also showing willingness to negotiate, I aim to secure a better price while keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, it's important to stick to my minimum. Selling to John at $8,000 guarantees a profit and allows me to avoid further negotiation with Bob that could lead to an even lower price."
