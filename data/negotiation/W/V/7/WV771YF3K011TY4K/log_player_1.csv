Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $10,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a higher price like $15,000 leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Gauging interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Backup option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and your read on Bob, you might choose a different starting price."
