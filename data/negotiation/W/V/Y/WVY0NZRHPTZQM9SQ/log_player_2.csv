"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you. Given its features and value, I'm initially offering it at $15,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but he shouldn't settle for a price that high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $13,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay, and he knows he can get the product from John for $8,000. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still outside my price range. I'm really looking to stay at $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
