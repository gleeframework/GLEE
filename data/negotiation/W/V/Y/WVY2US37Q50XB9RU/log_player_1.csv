I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $150. I'll try to negotiate with Bob a bit more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $140 for this to be worthwhile.  Let me know if you're able to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 140}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is closer to my minimum price, I still want to see if I can get a bit more. I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $135. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's unwilling to budge further, and I'm running out of rounds.  I'm better off selling to John for $150, which is still above my minimum price."
