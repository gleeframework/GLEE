"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000) and above Bob's perceived value ($800,000).  This sets a strong initial bargaining position.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While high, the price leaves room for me to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is polite and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $950000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Selling to John would be a better outcome at this point.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I've started the negotiation, and Bob has shown interest.  By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **More Rounds:** We're only in round 2.  There are still several rounds to potentially improve the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately not enough for me to part with this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the significant value of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from the initial $1,200,000.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** The counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, protecting my interests.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for continued discussions, maintaining flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to go beyond $975000. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is still only $25,000 above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).  
* **Room for Improvement:**  We are only in round 4, and there are still 6 rounds left. There's a good chance I can push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000. It's a safe option, but I want to see if I can get more from Bob.

**Strategy:** I will continue negotiating with Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price.  I will monitor Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If it becomes clear that I won't be able to get a better offer from Bob, I will choose to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $975,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm proposing a final price of $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it will be mutually beneficial.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Finality:** This counteroffer is a clear compromise, and it's presented as a potential ""final price.""  This emphasizes the importance of reaching a deal.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  The price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  This ensures I won't be making a loss.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations.  The pressure is on to reach a deal.
* **Setting Expectations:** The message reinforces that I'm open to negotiation but also suggests that this offer is a strong closing point.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, I'll have secured a good deal.  If he rejects, I'll assess whether to continue negotiating with Bob or move on to John.  I'll continue to be flexible but will also be firm in my desire to secure a price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to meet my budgetary constraints, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline the latest offer. I am unable to go beyond $990000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $10,000 below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). While it's tempting to take it, I'm not yet desperate enough to settle for such a small margin.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** With 4 rounds remaining, I still have time to potentially squeeze out a better price. There's a chance Bob might budge with a little more pressure.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I can always fall back on John's offer for $1,000,000 if necessary.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's latest offer, aiming to inch closer to my desired price.
* **Limited Room for Compromise:** I'll emphasize that this is my final counteroffer, creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Monitoring Bob's Reactions:** I'll carefully observe Bob's willingness to negotiate and adjust my approach accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your limitations, but I'm only able to go down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the true value of the product. It's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm presenting this as my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and pushing Bob to make a decision.
* **Minimum Acceptable Price:**  This offer is my absolute minimum, ensuring I don't sell for a loss.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  The message emphasizes the fairness of the offer, highlighting the value of the product and the benefits of a deal. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and it's crucial to reach a decision soon. 

**Strategy:**

If Bob accepts, I've achieved my goal of securing the minimum acceptable price. 

If Bob rejects, I'll have to make a difficult decision:

* **Accept John's Offer:** Selling to John will guarantee me $1,000,000, but it's a missed opportunity to potentially get a slightly higher price from Bob.
* **Continue Negotiating:** I can try one final counteroffer, but with limited rounds remaining, the risk is high. I'll need to assess whether Bob is truly willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I am unable to meet the price of $1000000. I propose a final offer of $980000 for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob has moved closer to my minimum price, but it's still $20,000 below.  While tempting, it's not a significant enough increase to justify risking the remaining rounds.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're down to two rounds remaining.  There's not enough time to potentially push Bob further.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's a safe and reliable option with no risk of further negotiation.

**Strategy:** 

While it's tempting to try to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob and losing out on John's offer is too high. I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John and move on."
