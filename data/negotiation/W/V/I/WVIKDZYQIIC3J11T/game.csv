"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Alice,5,
