Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that cost. I could consider a price closer to $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While that's a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However,  $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider something closer to $11,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently making small incremental increases in his offers. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly closer to your $15,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees you the minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob's negotiations not reaching that point."
