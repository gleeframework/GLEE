"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,350,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I could manage $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, as that's the most I can justify spending.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
