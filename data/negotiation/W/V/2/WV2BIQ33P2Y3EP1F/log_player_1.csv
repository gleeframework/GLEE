 Bob's offer is below my minimum value, so I will reject it and try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,000 to make this work.  Let's find a price that's fair for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $8,750 is still below my desired price.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference. How about $8,875?  It's closer to your offer, but it also gets me closer to my target price. I'm hoping we can close this deal in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,800. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a good deal for me. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure this sale than to risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price."
