"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
