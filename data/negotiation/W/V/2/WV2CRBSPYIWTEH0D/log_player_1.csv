"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully close the deal closer to my minimum desired price.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm highlighting the value Bob gets by acquiring the product, even at my offered price. This can make him more receptive to considering the deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message implies that I'm willing to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to counteroffer and keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.  Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I have multiple rounds left.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially secure a better price.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  The fact that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm decreasing my price from $18,000 to $16,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This keeps the door open for a deal.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $16,000 is above my minimum desired price of $15,000, so I'm still in a good position. 
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the value he gets by acquiring the product at this price. 
* **Compromise:**  The ""meet halfway"" phrase emphasizes my willingness to compromise, which can make Bob more receptive to my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Quite:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still $1,000 below my desired price. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I have multiple rounds left, and with a bit more negotiation, I might be able to get closer to my target price of $15,000.
* **John's Offer:**  The fact that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me confidence to reject Bob's offer and keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  $14,000 is close, but I need a bit more to make this work for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $14,500. It's a fair compromise, and you'll still get a great deal on this product."", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Again:** I'm offering a middle ground by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows continued willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Small Increment:** The $500 increment keeps the negotiations moving without drastically lowering my price.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" Bob still receives, reminding him of the product's value to him.
* **Time is Running Out:**  With fewer rounds left, I need to find a compromise that's acceptable without jeopardizing my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Limited:**  With only 4 rounds left, I need to make a decisive move. 
* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **John's Offer is a Sure Thing:**  John is willing to buy for $15,000, guaranteeing me my minimum target price.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Further negotiation with Bob could lead to a stalemate, especially with limited rounds remaining. 

It's better to secure the guaranteed deal with John than risk getting stuck in further negotiations with Bob."
