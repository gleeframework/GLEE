Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I believe $900,000 is a fair price that's in both our interests. It gives you a substantial profit while keeping the deal within my reach. Let's make this happen.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that you're trying to reach a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, $900,000 is still below my target.
