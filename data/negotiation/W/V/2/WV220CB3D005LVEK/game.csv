"I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a great opportunity, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",925000.0,Bob,4,
