"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1500000 to me, but I believe its value to you could be significantly higher. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. It's a substantial investment, but the potential return could be enormous. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.
