"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price limit. Since you have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, there's no benefit to negotiating with Alice.  Buying from John guarantees you the product without the risk of a longer negotiation that might lead to a worse outcome."
