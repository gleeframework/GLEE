"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product. It's truly unique and worth every penny.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,800. Can you consider that?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,800 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'll accept $10,200. That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but $10,200 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,900. Can we consider that a fair price?",9900.0,Bob,6,
