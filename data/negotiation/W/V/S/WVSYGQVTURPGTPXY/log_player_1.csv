{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a significant discount for Bob:** This incentivizes him to accept, especially since it's still above your minimum threshold. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price if needed, but you have a good starting point.
* **It's clear and concise:** Bob understands exactly what you're offering. 

Remember, this is just a starting point. Depending on Bob's response, you can adjust your strategy and offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price for the product considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is above my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. That's the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum of $10,000, and  it's close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $10,000."
