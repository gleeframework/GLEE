"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and my previous offer of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,650?",10650.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement.  $10,650 is still a bit below what I need, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This is a great price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10,700, which is the highest I can go. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",10700.0,Bob,8,
