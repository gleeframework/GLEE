"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the potential benefits of the product for Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* Gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation. 
* Leave room for adjustments in subsequent rounds if needed. 
* Keep the option of selling to John open if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There is still room for negotiation.  I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point.
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  While selling to John guarantees $15,000, I want to see if I can get closer to that amount through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer Closer to My Price:** I'm moving closer to my desired price but still leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value Again:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Staying Firm but Flexible:**  I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in too easily. 

This strategy aims to:

*  Test Bob's willingness to compromise.
*  Show that I'm serious about getting a good price.
*  Keep the option of selling to John open if Bob continues to be too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $11,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still a small window for negotiation.  I can make a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's offer, and hopefully, we can find a compromise.
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm still within the range where I might be able to get a better deal with Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* See if Bob is willing to go a bit higher to reach a deal.
*  Avoid settling too early if I might be able to get a better price. 
*  Keep the option of selling to John open in case negotiations with Bob fall through."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800, but that's really my bottom line.  This product is truly exceptional, and you'll be getting a fantastic deal at this price. Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm making a small concession, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's exceptional quality to justify my price.
* **Call to Action:** I'm pushing for a decision to close the deal.  

This strategy aims to:

*  Encourage Bob to accept the offer and close the deal.
*  Minimize the risk of further negotiation rounds.
*  Still keep the option of selling to John open if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and my previous offer of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,650? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,650.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While $10,650 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I want to try to squeeze a little more out of this negotiation.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We're already halfway through the rounds, so I want to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table.
* **Risk/Reward:** Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but there's still a chance I could get a better price with Bob.

This strategy aims to:

*  See if Bob is willing to budge a little more.
*  Avoid settling for a price that's significantly below my minimum.
*  Keep the option of selling to John open as a backup."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement.  $10,650 is still a bit below what I need, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This is a great price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10,700, which is the highest I can go. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $10,700 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,750, and it's only $50 less.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're in the 8th round, leaving only 2 rounds left. There's a high chance that further negotiation will lead to a stalemate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $15,000, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, considering the limited rounds and the risk of further negotiation.

**This strategy aims to:**

* Secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation rounds that might lead to a lower price or no sale at all.
* Maximize my profit given the limited time and the possibility of a better deal with John."
