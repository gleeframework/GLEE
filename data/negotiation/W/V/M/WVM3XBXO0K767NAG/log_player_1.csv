Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're guaranteed at least $800,000 from John, so you want to aim higher.
* **It's significantly lower than Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can potentially increase the price if Bob seems interested but needs a lower price.

By offering a price like this, you maximize your chances of getting a better price than your minimum while still being attractive to Bob."
