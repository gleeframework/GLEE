"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $950,000. It's a steal considering its value to you.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can likely do better. You have a clear goal of getting the product for under $1,000,000, and there's still room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate seriously while still leaving room for further bargaining.
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Alice reinforces your point that the asking price is too high.
* **Win-Win:**  The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution, which can help build a positive rapport and keep Alice engaged in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  This is still a great price for you, considering the value of this product. Let's finalize this and make it a win-win situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your ideal price, but $900,000 is still above your target. There's still room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal by making another counteroffer. You're still within the range where you could save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit high at $900,000.  How about we settle at $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Change:** This counteroffer is a smaller move than the previous one, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** The message focuses on fairness, which can appeal to Alice's sense of reason and make her more likely to accept.
* **Closing the Deal:**  The message suggests finalizing the deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Alice to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm still not quite there at $875,000. Let's meet in the middle at $890,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but $890,000 is still a bit too high.  You've shown a willingness to compromise, and you're still in a strong position to negotiate further. Rejecting this offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a price closer to your desired $850,000.  Remember, you have limited rounds, but you're still in a good position to get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $880,000?
