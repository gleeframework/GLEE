"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer, and I see you're serious about getting this product.  $1,200,000 is a little too low for me to consider right now.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway, again.  How about $1,300,000?  This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.  Let's make this happen!",1300000.0,Alice,3,
