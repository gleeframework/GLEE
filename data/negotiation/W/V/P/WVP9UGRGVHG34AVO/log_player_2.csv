"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the product for closer to my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get the product within your budget, but I still need to make a profit. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I'm still confident I can get it lower.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.  I'm not yet at a point where I'd consider buying from John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me and the potential savings for you compared to selling to John."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and I'm now within a range that I'm comfortable with.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to compromise further, or that I'll run out of rounds.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product for a price that is both reasonable and saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
