"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the fair market value for this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable paying $11,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. To be fair, I could come down to $11,750.  This is my final offer.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident $11,000 is a fair price, given that it's closer to my initial offer and it's still above your minimum. Let's make this deal happen.",11000.0,Bob,6,
