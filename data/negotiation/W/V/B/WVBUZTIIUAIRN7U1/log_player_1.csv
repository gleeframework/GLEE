Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $95 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's closer to my value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build a rapport with Bob by expressing confidence in the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum price of $80.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This would still allow me to get a fair price for the product, while also giving you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $90. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price.  I'm also trying to reiterate the value of the product by saying that it's a good deal for him."
