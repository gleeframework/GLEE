"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product within my budget while still giving you a reasonable profit.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
