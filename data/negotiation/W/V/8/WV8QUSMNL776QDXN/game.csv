Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.,10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9500. This is my best offer.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9500, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9000.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9200. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider selling to John.",9200.0,Alice,5,
