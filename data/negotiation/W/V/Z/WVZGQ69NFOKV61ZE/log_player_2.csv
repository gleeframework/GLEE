# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a considerable amount to me, at least $1,000,000, and I believe it holds even greater value for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This reflects the product's inherent value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm still confident that this product holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm not willing to drop below $1,250,000. This price reflects a significant concession on my part and would still allow you a substantial return on your investment. Let's close this deal and move forward.

However, since I've already made a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's current offer, I should be aware that Alice can reject it and make a new offer. In this case, I should be prepared to either accept the new offer or buy the product from Jhon.

So, I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.
