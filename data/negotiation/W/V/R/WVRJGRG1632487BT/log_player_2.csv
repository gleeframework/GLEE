# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Please let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
