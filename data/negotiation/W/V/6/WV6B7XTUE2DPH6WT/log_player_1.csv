Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $17,500?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go substantially higher than $14,000.  It's better to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk Bob walking away and potentially getting stuck with the product."
