"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product.  However, I'm going to need a lower price to make this work for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as 750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for 850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still not quite there yet on the price.  I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for 800000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for 825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
