Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential ""deal"" for Bob. It's significantly higher than his perceived value, but the message implies others are willing to pay more. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested parties adds pressure on Bob to make a decision quickly, potentially leading him to accept even if he thinks it's slightly overpriced."
