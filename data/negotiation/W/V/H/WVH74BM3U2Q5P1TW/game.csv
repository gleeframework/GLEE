"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,320,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider that?",1320000.0,Bob,4,
