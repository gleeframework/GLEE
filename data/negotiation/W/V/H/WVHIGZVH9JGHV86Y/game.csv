"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but could we work something closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a deal at $11,500. It's the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to you is $15,000",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $11,500 is still a touch high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,750. I can offer you a deal at $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems we're going in circles here.  Your last offer isn't much different than your first. I'm willing to pay $10,500, but I need to know you're serious about negotiating.",10500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand we've been going back and forth, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I can see you're serious about the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you",11250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $10,900.  If you can't accept that, I'll unfortunately have to go with John.",10900.0,Bob,10,
