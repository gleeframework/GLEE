"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $850,000? This would still leave you a significant margin for profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
