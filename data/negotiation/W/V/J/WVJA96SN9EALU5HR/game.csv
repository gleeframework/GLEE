"Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, just as it has been to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000. I think its potential is worth far more than that, but I value our potential partnership and believe this offer represents a fair starting point for us both.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our potential partnership.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, I'm confident this product can generate significantly more value than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  I believe this offer represents a strong commitment from me while still reflecting the true value of what I'm offering.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I still think that's a bit high. I'd like to propose a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to be straightforward. While I'm open to negotiation, I need you to understand the true value of what I'm offering.  My price of $1,350,000 is already a significant compromise. I'm willing to hold firm at that price for now.  I believe it's a fair deal considering the potential returns you'll see from this product.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
