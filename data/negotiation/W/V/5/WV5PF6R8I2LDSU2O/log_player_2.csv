"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be perfect for you! Given its value, I'm offering it at $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below our $10,000 maximum.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message maintains a positive tone, expressing interest in the product while clearly stating our budget limitations. 
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** We use ""around $7,000,"" leaving room for some flexibility in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $7,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer it to you for $8,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:**  Alice moved closer to the middle ground, but $8,500 is still above her value for the product ($8,000). This indicates we likely have some leverage to negotiate a lower price.
* **Avoiding a Rush:** We have plenty of rounds left, so there's no need to accept an offer we're not entirely happy with just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $7,500? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving up from our initial offer of $7,000, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate. 
* **Staying Firm:**  However, the increase is relatively small ($500). This demonstrates we're serious about getting a good deal and not easily swayed. 
* **Justifying the Price:** By calling it a ""fair price,"" we aim to nudge Alice towards a number closer to her $8,000 value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $8,200, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Alice has indicated this is her ""final offer."" While it might not be her absolute final offer, it suggests she's nearing her limit.
* **Good Deal:** $8,200 is a reasonable price, significantly lower than both our initial maximum and John's alternative offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice walking away, forcing us to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids that risk."
