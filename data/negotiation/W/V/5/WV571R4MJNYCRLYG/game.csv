"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $950000. I believe this is a fair starting point, given the value of the product to both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $950000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1050000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more flexibility. How about $1000000? This would allow us both to close a deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
