Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.  I'm asking for $1,200,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification for value:**  By highlighting the product's value specifically to Bob (""someone like you""), you aim to justify the high price.
* **Leaving the door open:** Ending with ""What do you think?"" encourages a response from Bob and keeps the negotiation open.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to potentially lower your price during negotiations, but never go below your $800,000 safety net."
