Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000** is a starting point that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* This offer allows for potential compromise while keeping the price closer to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
*  I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate upwards. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter, but I'll also keep the option of selling to John at $12,000 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is higher than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my value. Selling to John at $12,000 is always a safe option, but I believe there's potential to secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* It shows that I'm willing to compromise but also that I believe the product is worth more than $9,500. 
* By meeting halfway between our last offers, I'm hoping to push for a deal while remaining flexible in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value.  I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. There's a chance Bob might budge a bit more. However, if he rejects my next counteroffer, I'll likely opt to sell to John at $12,000 to ensure I meet my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering $10,200. This is a further compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  
* However, it's still above Bob's offer and allows for a potential agreement without significantly impacting my profit.
* This is likely my last attempt to secure a deal with Bob.  If he rejects, I'll accept the $12,000 offer from John to guarantee my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed profit.  Bob has shown he's unwilling to go higher than $9,600, which is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer a higher price,  selling to John for $12,000 ensures I meet my financial goal and avoids further negotiations that might not be fruitful."
