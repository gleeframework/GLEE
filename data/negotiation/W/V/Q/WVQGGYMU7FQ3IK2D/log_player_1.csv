Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit if Bob accepts.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value"" creates a sense of desirability and justifies the high price tag. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is open for discussion. Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, but you have a strong fallback option with John."
