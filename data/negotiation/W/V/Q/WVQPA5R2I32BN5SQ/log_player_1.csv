{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's best to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is just too low for me. How about $140? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $130 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still not sure if $135 is the best price for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  At this point, it's clear that Bob and I are not going to be able to agree on a price.  Selling to John for $150 is the best option for me."
