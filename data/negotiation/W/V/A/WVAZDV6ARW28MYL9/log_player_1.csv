"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000.  This is a fair starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's value to Bob but not excessively so.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12300}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,300. It's getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm getting close to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure a sale now than risk having to sell to John for the minimum."
