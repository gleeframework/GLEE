"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I need to be flexible, I won't accept such a drastic cut in price.  It's better to keep negotiating and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but still keeping it well above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I also need to make sure I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is inching closer to my price, $900,000 is still not acceptable.  I need to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm continuing to move closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the product's value to me. This offer should feel more attainable for Bob while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is improving, it's still not in the range I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm not quite ready to settle for $950,000, but I'm getting closer to the point where John's offer becomes more tempting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This is my final offer to Bob.  I'm going to be much more firm on this price. It's still a good profit for me and I believe it is a fair price given the product's value to him.  If he doesn't take this offer, I will sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I've reached my limit with negotiation, and John is offering a significantly higher price. I'm going to sell to John and secure a much better deal."
