Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited time,"" you might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
 
This strategy aims to get you the best possible price while considering Bob's valuation and your alternative option."
