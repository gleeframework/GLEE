"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a rare and valuable item. I'm thinking of a price of $25000 for it. What are your thoughts?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $25000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you meet me in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I can meet you halfway, but I'll need to get $22000 for the product. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $22000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $18000. Can you consider that?",18000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $18000 is the right price for this product, Bob. I can do $20000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

"I'm not willing to go as low as $16500, Bob. I can do $18500, but I'm starting to think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,9,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $16000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",16000.0,Bob,10,
