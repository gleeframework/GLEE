"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit hesitant to go that high. I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $975000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than that.
