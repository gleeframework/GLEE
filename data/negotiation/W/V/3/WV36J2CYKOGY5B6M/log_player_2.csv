# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Alice's offer is quite high. There's a good chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $110 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",

}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better, we're still aiming for a price closer to $90. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $100, Alice, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway. Could you do $95? I think that's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

This counter-offer shows Alice that we're willing to compromise but are still firm on getting a good deal. It also keeps the negotiation moving by suggesting a concrete price point."
