"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,350,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our valuations is still significant.  I could consider coming down to $1,250,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  He wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting this offer and counter-offering again might lead to a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial limitations.  I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. Let's split the difference â€“ $1,200,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's budget and he's already made multiple counteroffers.  It's likely that further negotiations won't result in a lower price from Alice.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and gets the product he wants."
