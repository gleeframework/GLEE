,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,350,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our valuations is still significant.  I could consider coming down to $1,250,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial limitations.  I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. Let's split the difference â€“ $1,200,000.  This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
