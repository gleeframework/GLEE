Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer that still leaves me with a significant gain. It also provides Bob with a compelling incentive to buy now rather than risk missing out. 
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:** The fact that I have another buyer willing to pay my desired price provides me with a strong negotiating position. I don't need to undervalue the product drastically."
