Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it's offered elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting negotiations significantly lower might be perceived as insulting or undervalue the product. A higher starting point leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and potential, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning that it will be ""offered elsewhere"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John if Bob refuses. This strong alternative allows Alice to negotiate from a position of strength.

By setting the initial price at $1,300,000, Alice aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts, Alice earns a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, but there's a good chance a compromise can be reached above $1,500,000. 
3. **Maintain a Strong Position:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can confidently sell to John at her desired price."
