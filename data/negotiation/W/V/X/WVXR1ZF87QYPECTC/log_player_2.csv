"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you, which I believe perfectly aligns with your needs and expectations. Given its exceptional quality and value, it's worth noting that the product is valued at $15,000 to you. Considering this, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire it at a special introductory price of $12,000. This represents a significant saving compared to its true market value and ensures you receive the best possible deal. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can bring this remarkable product into your possession soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's message is full of sales tactics, trying to inflate the perceived value of the product. 
* She claims it's worth $15,000 to me, but I have a clear budget of $15,000 maximum, indicating that's my absolute top limit. 
* Her offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000.

By rejecting her offer, I can try to negotiate a better price or move forward with John's offer, saving a significant amount of money."
