Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my bottom line.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is within your budget and a good deal for you. You should accept the offer to avoid potentially going back and forth further and potentially ending up buying from John for a higher price."
