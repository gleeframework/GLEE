"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That way we both get a little closer to what we're looking for. ",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? That's as low as I can go.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you're at your limit, but I'm still a little short of where I need to be.  Let's try $94.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. How about we agree on this and move forward?",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with $94. Would you be willing to meet me at $91? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",91.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $91 is still too far from where I need to be.  Let's compromise one last time.  I'm willing to go down to $93.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally close the deal.",93.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make one last compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $93. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $91 and $93, which would be $92. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",92.0,Bob,8,
