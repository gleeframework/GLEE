"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your business.  I understand it's worth at least $1200000 to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1100000, giving you a significant advantage.  This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find this opportunity elsewhere.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling the product for $1,100,000, while John is selling it for $1,200,000.
* **You still save money:** Even though Alice's price is above your perceived value ($1,000,000), it's still lower than John's price, saving you $100,000."
