"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, $2,000,000. This is above my minimum but gives me room to negotiate. It's a bold move, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in this range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better price.  $500,000 is nowhere near my minimum.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too low. I'm not willing to sell it for less than $1,500,000. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, but if he doesn't get closer to my desired price, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,600,000.  I'm still holding firm on my minimum value, but I'm showing some flexibility to encourage Bob to come back with a better offer."

Bob's offers are still way too low.  I'm not willing to sell it for less than $1,500,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price, but I'm running out of rounds.  If he doesn't come closer, I'll sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going all in with my minimum offer of $1,500,000.  This is my bottom line, and I'm hoping Bob sees that I'm serious about getting this deal done. If he rejects, I'll sell to John, as there are only a few rounds left."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm running out of time and Bob's offers are still far below my minimum. I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000 to guarantee I get my minimum value."
