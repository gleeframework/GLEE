Alice's offer is still too high. I'm going to continue negotiating.  While I could buy from John for $800,000, I'm hoping to get a better price from Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $750,000. This shows Alice I'm committed to reaching a deal, but I'm still not willing to go much higher. Hopefully this will get closer to a price we can both agree on."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
