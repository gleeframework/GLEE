Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering your last offer, I am unable to increase my budget. However, I would like to propose an alternative solution. Instead of purchasing the product now, could we agree on a payment plan? Perhaps $10,000 upfront and the remainder over the next 6 months? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:

While Bob's suggestion of a payment plan is interesting, it introduces risk and complexity. There's no guarantee he'll fulfill the full payment over time. Accepting $10,000 upfront is a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $15,000 offer.  It's time to move on to the secure deal."
