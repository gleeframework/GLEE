"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $900,000. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $940,000?",940000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $940,000 and $1,000,000, which is $970,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",970000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, $970,000 is getting close. To make this work for me, could we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $980,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",980000.0,Alice,7,
