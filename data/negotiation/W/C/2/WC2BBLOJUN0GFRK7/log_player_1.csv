{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130.  It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more to me than that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$130 price:** This is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than my minimum of $150, but high enough to leave room for negotiation and still give me a decent profit.
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to be friendly and emphasize the value Bob is getting. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product so highly. While I'm interested, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I'm open to negotiation, $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by counter-offering and continuing the negotiation. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's still a great value for you, and it lets me get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer rationale:** This counter-offer is a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my minimum price. 
* **Message tone:** I'm staying positive and emphasizing the value Bob is still getting.  I'm also acknowledging his desire for a good deal to keep the negotiation friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $100 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get a better price by counter-offering and continuing the negotiation. I think I can convince Bob to come closer to my desired price. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is unfortunately still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer rationale:** This counter-offer is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows that I am willing to negotiate, but also firm on my minimum price.
* **Message tone:** I am being polite and understanding, while still maintaining a firm stance. I am highlighting that this offer is a fair compromise, which should incentivize Bob to accept."
