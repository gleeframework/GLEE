"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,050,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $1,075,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, but I'm still aiming to keep my spending within my budget. Could we possibly aim for $1,060,000? This would allow us to close the gap slightly and move closer towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
