"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $15000. Would you consider $13500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
