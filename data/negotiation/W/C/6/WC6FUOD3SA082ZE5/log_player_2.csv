{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is within your budget, you can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice. It's likely she's willing to drop her price to get a deal done."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value. I'm hoping this will prompt her to consider negotiating further, as she's likely to want to close the deal at a price closer to her value."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While I'm not in a rush, I'm not willing to pay that much.  It's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $900,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to compromise.  This offer is still within my budget and likely closer to a point where Alice might accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Although we are nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, it's still possible to get a better deal. I will continue to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers have been stubborn, so I'm raising my offer again to $925,000.  This demonstrates my seriousness about buying, and it's closer to her perceived value of the product.  If she rejects again, it's likely we are nearing a stalemate, and I might have to seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers have been consistently high, and we're nearing the end of our allotted negotiation rounds.  While I'm still hoping to save money,  I'm concerned that further negotiations won't get us closer to a mutually agreeable price.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John, even if it means paying a slightly higher price."
