"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is $12,000. Would you be open to discussing that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $12,000. It's the best I can do.",12000.0,Bob,4,
