"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're really trying to get the best price, and I admire that. However, $8,750 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $9,250.  Let's try to close this deal.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
