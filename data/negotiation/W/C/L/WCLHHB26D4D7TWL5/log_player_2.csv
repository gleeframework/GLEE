"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that you'll find it to be a great investment, but if you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is eager to purchase it at this price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same as what John is offering.  There's no benefit to rejecting Alice's offer, as you'll end up paying the same price to John.  Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, accepting the offer and getting the product is the best course of action."
