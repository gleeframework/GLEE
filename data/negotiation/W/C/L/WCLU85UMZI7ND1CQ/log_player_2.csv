# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to provide exceptional value and quality. This product is worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it holds significant potential benefits for you as well. Given its unique features and the time invested in its development, I am offering it to you for $125. I understand that value is subjective, so if this price aligns with your assessment of the product's worth, I would be delighted to proceed with the sale. Thank you for considering this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can get the same product for $120 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer of $125 makes more sense."
