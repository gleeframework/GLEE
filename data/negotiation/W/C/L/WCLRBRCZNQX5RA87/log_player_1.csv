I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $1,300,000 is still below my minimum desired amount, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, or at least get closer to my target before I need to consider selling to John."

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'd like to get a better price, Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm not confident I can negotiate a higher price, and I'm worried that continuing to reject offers could lead to a stalemate.  I'd rather secure a sale with John and ensure I at least get my minimum desired amount."
