"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from the price you're looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,350,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still below my minimum. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,375,000. This leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $1,375,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle on this one.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
