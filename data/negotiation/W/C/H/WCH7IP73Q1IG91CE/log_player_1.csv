Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can come down a bit, but I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to accept a loss on this product yet. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm willing to compromise a little, but I want to make sure I at least cover my minimum.  This counteroffer gives Bob a bit more room to negotiate, but still leaves me with a profit."
