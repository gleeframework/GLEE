"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is substantial, and $1,150,000 significantly undervalues its potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still thinking that $1,225,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer of $1,175,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I can't go as low as $1,175,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,175,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
