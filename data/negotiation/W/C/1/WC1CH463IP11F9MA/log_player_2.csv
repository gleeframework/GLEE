"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget.  It's time to negotiate!  You know you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message expresses continued interest in the product while clearly stating our budget limitations. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** Our goal is to get the product as close to our ideal price ($10,000) as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, but not there yet:** Alice came down significantly, which is a good sign. However, $12,000 is still above our budget and what we know we can get it for from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are still several rounds left, giving us the opportunity to try and get Alice closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. While $12,000 is a bit closer, it's still a stretch for me. How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair offer, and it would allow me to purchase the product from you today."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but Respectful:** We're now firmly stating our maximum budget to Alice. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By suggesting we can ""purchase today"" at $10,000, we add a bit of incentive for Alice to accept. 
* **John as Leverage:** We know we can get it for $10,000 elsewhere, which gives us a strong position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has essentially re-stated a previous offer and declared it her ""lowest price.""  This strongly suggests she's not going to budge much further.
* **John's Guarantee:**  We have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $10,000 from John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate when we know we can get our target price elsewhere.
* **Time Saved:**  By going with John, we avoid the potential for several more rounds of back-and-forth with Alice that may not result in a significantly better deal."
