"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $1,300,000. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
