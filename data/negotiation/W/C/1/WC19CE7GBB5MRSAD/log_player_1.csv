Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I know it's valuable to you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. You can then gradually lower the price, potentially settling on a figure still higher than your guaranteed $1,200,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to earn as much as possible, and this strategy gives you the best chance of exceeding your minimum acceptable price."
