Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a better deal if he counters.
* **Aiming for Maximum Profit:** While Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John, so there's no risk of losing money by aiming high with Bob. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower the price, but never go below your $80 minimum."
