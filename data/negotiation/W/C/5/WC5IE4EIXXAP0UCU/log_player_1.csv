Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully encourages Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a significant discount from my asking price, but it's the best I can offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $13,000?  I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $13,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one last concession.  I'm prepared to sell the product to you for $13,750.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not quite there.  $13,250 is the highest I can go at this point.  If you're willing to come down to this price, we can finalize the deal.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're close to your limit, but I need to stay closer to mine. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This gives us both a fair deal.  Let's wrap this up!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
