Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. How about we set the product price at $1,350,000? I understand this is a bit lower than your initial offer, but I'm hoping for a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), I still have room to negotiate. I want to try to get closer to my ideal price of $1,400,000.  I believe I can get a better deal with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1,350,000 is still quite a bit below my valuation.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,375,000? This price reflects a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your offer, I would like to suggest a price of $1,360,000. This is closer to your original offer but still within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement that suits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is getting closer to my desired price of $1,400,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm running out of rounds and there's a risk of a stalemate or Bob backing out.  This offer is a good compromise and guarantees a sale above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."
