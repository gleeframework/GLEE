"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We'll start the negotiation by rejecting Alice's initial offer. It's too close to our maximum budget, leaving little room for saving money. By counter-offering, we can try to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're aiming to bring the price closer to Alice's perceived value while staying within a reasonable range of our budget.  This counter-offer leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get good value for your money. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a price we can work with, but we still have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get the price down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 97
}
```

We're proposing a price slightly below the midpoint between our previous offer and Alice's counter-offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a better deal."
