Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob. Since I value the product at no less than $100, I'll start with a relatively high price.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but it's still a decent offer. Since I value the product at no less than $100, I'll consider accepting his offer.
