"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  You know you can get the product from John for the same price. By rejecting the offer, you can potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount ($20 off) is a good strategy. It shows Alice you're serious about buying but are also looking for a better deal.  This sets the stage for negotiation and hopefully gets Alice to counter with a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still not the best possible deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get the price down even further. There are still several rounds left, so there's time to reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice came down to $110, it's reasonable to increase your offer slightly.  $105 represents a compromise and shows you are willing to meet her halfway. It's likely she'll counter with a price closer to this, potentially leading to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is a good price considering your initial goal was to save as much as possible. While you could try to get a lower price, you've already gone through several rounds and there's no guarantee you'll get a better offer. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or you having to buy from John at the higher price."
