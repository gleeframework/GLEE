"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to gauge his interest and potentially get a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll try to get closer to that number in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground.  I'm still aiming to get closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I want to avoid risking losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'll try to get closer to my minimum in the next round, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and that he'll accept.  If not, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a price that meets my minimum. I'm confident that John will buy the product from me for $120, which is a better deal than what Bob is offering. It's time to move on and secure a sure thing."
