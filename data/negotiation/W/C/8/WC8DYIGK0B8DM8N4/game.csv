"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $12000 for it. Would you be open to discussing this further?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns and I'm willing to negotiate further. Considering the product's value to you is $12000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value it holds for you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still unable to agree to $16000. I would like to propose $14000 as a counteroffer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to negotiate further. I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I'm not ready to give up on my desired price just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $15500. This is a compromise that still takes into account the value it holds for you, but also respects my original asking price. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the effort to reach a compromise. However, I must respectfully decline the $15500 offer. I am still committed to finding a solution that aligns with both our interests. My counteroffer remains at $14000.",14000.0,Bob,6,
