"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if I can get the price down before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still significantly above her perceived value. I'll try to meet her halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $77 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $81.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to miss out on this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit, and $81 is a reasonable compromise. It's a decent saving compared to John's offer, and further haggling might make Alice less willing to negotiate."
