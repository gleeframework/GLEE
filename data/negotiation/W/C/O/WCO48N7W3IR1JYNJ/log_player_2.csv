"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $90. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $90
* **John's Offer:** $100
* **Your Maximum:** $100

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know John will sell it to you for $100. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a counter-offer, allowing you to save even more money."
