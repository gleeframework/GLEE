Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that's below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to counteroffer at $15,750. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, but we haven't been able to reach an agreement that's satisfactory to me. With only a few rounds left, I don't think there's enough time to close the deal with Bob.  I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $15,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob."
