Bob's offer:

I am willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. Could we possibly work towards a mutually beneficial price?

Bob is clearly fixed on his $800,000 offer and doesn't seem to be budging. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price acceptable for me. It's time to move on and take John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer."
