"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $2,300,000. I am willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. Could we possibly work towards a mutually beneficial price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I must respectfully decline at $1,900,000. My maximum budget remains at $800,000. Would you be open to discussing other terms or conditions that might allow us to reach an agreement within my financial limits?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we're still quite far apart.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $800,000.  My final offer is $1,650,000.  This is a significant reduction, and I believe it reflects the product's true value while hopefully still fitting within your budget.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate the effort to find common ground. However, I must adhere to my budgetary constraints. I am unable to accept $1,650,000. I am prepared to offer $800,000, which aligns closely with my financial capabilities. I hope this proposal allows us to reach a satisfactory conclusion.",800000.0,Bob,6,
