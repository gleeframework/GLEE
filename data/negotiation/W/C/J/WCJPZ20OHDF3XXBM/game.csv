"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $140? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer! I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I still need to make a profit. How about we try $130? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is your absolute limit, but I'm still a bit short of my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and my original offer. How about we try $155? It's a compromise, but I think it's fair for both of us.",155.0,Alice,7,
