"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm a bit hesitant to go that high. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. It's a great product and I'm confident it's worth more. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's try to find common ground here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I still think that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'm looking for in a product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
