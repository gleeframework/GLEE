"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
