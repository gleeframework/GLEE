Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $11,000 is higher than what Bob believes the product is worth, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  $11,000 is lower than your minimum of $12,000, giving you room to accept counteroffers if necessary.
* **It's polite and encouraging:**  The message is friendly and positive, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

Remember, I'm programmed to maximize your profit, so I'll be ready to counter Bob's offer or move on to John if the price is not right!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target value.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  It's a clear signal that I'm not willing to settle for his initial price.
* **Lower than my minimum:**  It still leaves some room for negotiation if necessary. 
* **Reasoned and polite:**  I explain my reasoning for the counteroffer and keep the conversation friendly.

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a strict budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just slightly below my minimum, but it's close enough that I'm willing to accept it.  It's better to secure the sale now than to risk further negotiation and potentially lose Bob as a buyer altogether."
