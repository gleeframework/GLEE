,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $135? It's a great deal for both of us!",135.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit lower than that. How about $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $130, but I'm still open to negotiating. How about we try $137? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",137.0,Alice,5,

I'm not sure I'm willing to meet you halfway this time. How about $133?,133.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $133. I think I've already been very flexible, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin further. I'm willing to meet you at $138, but that's my final offer.",138.0,Alice,9,
