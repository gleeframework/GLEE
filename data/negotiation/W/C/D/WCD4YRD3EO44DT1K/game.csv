"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a profit. Let's try $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need a more reasonable price. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $700,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. Let's try $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
