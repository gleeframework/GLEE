Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. I believe it's worth considerably more, but I'm happy to extend this price to you."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($80). 
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  Offering it for the maximum ($120) might seem too aggressive and could make Bob less likely to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to balance profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and forcing you to accept the $80 from John."
