"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm looking to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to me. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go above $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a great deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1000000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product.  To continue our negotiations, I'm proposing a price of $1100000. This leaves room for you to get a good deal while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
