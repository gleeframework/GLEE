"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the product's potential.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000?  I believe this price reflects the value while still allowing you a healthy profit.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,300,000 is a fair reflection of its value, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
