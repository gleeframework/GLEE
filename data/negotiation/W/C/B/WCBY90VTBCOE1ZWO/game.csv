"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value it holds for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
