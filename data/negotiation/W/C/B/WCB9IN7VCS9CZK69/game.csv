"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $600,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $650,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $625,000 and call it a deal?",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I like your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $625,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $675,000. This is my final concession, and I'm confident it's the best deal I can offer.",675000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  To show I'm serious, I'll raise my offer to $640,000.  I think that's a very fair offer considering the value and gets us both what we want.",640000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $640,000. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $690,000. This is my last concession, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",690000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're really close now. I understand this is your final offer, so let's meet in the middle.  How about $660,000? That's a fair compromise and will let us close this deal.",660000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to compromise further. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get the best possible price for this product. I'm now offering the product to you for $700,000, which is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet this price, I'll have to consider other options.",700000.0,Alice,9,
