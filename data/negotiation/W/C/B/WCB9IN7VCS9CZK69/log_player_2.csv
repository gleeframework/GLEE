Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to compromise further. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get the best possible price for this product. I'm now offering the product to you for $700,000, which is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet this price, I'll have to consider other options.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice has gone back up to her original offer and is unlikely to budge.  It's clear she's trying to maximize her profit and isn't willing to meet in the middle.  While buying from John means spending $100,000 more than desired, it's better than risking Alice being even more stubborn in the last round and potentially losing the deal entirely."
