Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $1,062,500. I've already made significant concessions, and I believe $1,075,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm not going to go any higher, so I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000 one more time. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

It seems like Alice is firm on her price of $1,075,000.  While we could try one more counteroffer, there's a risk she walks away and we're left with John's higher price.  Accepting her offer now guarantees we get the product for a significant discount from John's price."
