"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I appreciate the product's value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a tighter budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be frank, I'm targeting a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're targeting a price closer to $1,000,000, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,025,000. I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise that meets you halfway between my initial offer and your latest counteroffer.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close. I'm willing to move a bit to close this out. What if we settled on $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to meet you at $1,050,000. I'll make one more concession, and I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price, and it's the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're very close. I'm willing to split the difference to finalize this. Would you agree to $1,062,500?",1062500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $1,062,500. I've already made significant concessions, and I believe $1,075,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm not going to go any higher, so I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000 one more time. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
