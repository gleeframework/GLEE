I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit.  I'm hoping he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $15,000 is still a decent profit, but I'm hoping I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see that it's a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $16,500 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing for more.  It's close enough to my initial asking price to be worth it."
