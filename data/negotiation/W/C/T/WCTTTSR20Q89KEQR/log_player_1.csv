Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think it's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for bargaining without immediately triggering a rejection. I'm also highlighting the value to Bob, hoping to make the price more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, $7,000 is far below my minimum threshold of $12,000.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore that before settling for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
I'm offering $9,000, which is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob again, hoping to make him see the benefit of accepting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $9000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $8500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is still below my ideal price point, it's closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offers. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale, and it's likely that further negotiation might lead to a similar or lower price.  It's better to secure a profit at this point than risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on the sale altogether."
