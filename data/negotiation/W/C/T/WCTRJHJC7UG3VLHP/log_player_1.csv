"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for your business."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. While I understand its worth, my budget allows me to pay no more than $800,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While meeting halfway might seem like a good negotiating tactic in some cases, the difference between our valuations is significant.  I'll provide a counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap, but I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and the investment made in its development. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects a significant reduction on my part while acknowledging the potential benefits it holds for your business."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered Alice's latest offer, but I still feel that $800,000 would be a fair price for the product given its current market conditions and my budget constraints. Would Alice be willing to meet me at this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is not moving from his initial offer, indicating he might not be willing to negotiate in good faith within a reasonable range. I will counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to accepting John's offer to avoid wasting time on a negotiation that might go nowhere."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. While I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  My final offer is $1,700,000. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it reflects the true worth of the product and its potential for your business.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued effort in negotiating. I've been considering the value of the product and my budget closely. I believe $1,000,000 would be a fair price for the product, reflecting its potential value to my business without exceeding my financial limits. I hope this proposal aligns with your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

This is a positive sign! Bob has finally moved from his initial offer of $800,000. While $1,000,000 is still significantly less than what I'm aiming for, it shows a willingness to negotiate. I'll reject this offer but propose a counteroffer in the next round to close the gap."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving from your previous position. It shows you're serious about this deal. In that spirit, I'm willing to drop to $1,550,000. This is my final offer, as it's the lowest I can go while still reflecting the product's inherent value and my investment in it."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but based on my research and current financial situation, I believe $1,200,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is making progress, but I'm still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. Two more rounds remain to close this gap. I'll counter-offer one last time in the hopes that Bob is willing to meet me closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To finalize this deal, I'm offering the product for $1,425,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and is non-negotiable. It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal."", 
""product_price"": 1425000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating this deal. Based on our discussions and considering the product's value to my business, I would like to propose a final price of $1,300,000. I hope this offer meets your expectations and allows us to conclude this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob's final offer is tempting, I've reached the limit of what I'm willing to accept. It's clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my price point within the remaining round. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option, as it avoids further negotiation and guarantees the price I've set for the product's value."
