Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (even if it's just ""given its value"") makes it seem less arbitrary and more anchored to the product's worth.
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you can always lower the price slightly. If he counters, you know he's serious about buying. 

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob."
