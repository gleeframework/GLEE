"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe it's a great investment. Would you like to purchase it today? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $105 is better than John's price of $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant price reduction. He's acknowledging Alice's offer while expressing his willingness to negotiate.  Offering $95 gives him room to potentially meet halfway with Alice if she counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. I am proposing to sell the product for $100. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $100, meeting Bob halfway from his previous offer. This is a good deal for Bob, as he's saving $20 compared to buying from John.  While there's always the possibility of getting a slightly lower price, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a stalemate or a higher price from Alice makes accepting the current offer the most sensible choice."
