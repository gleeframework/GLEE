Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with the highest price I can, given that John is willing to pay that much. This sets the baseline and forces Bob to negotiate downwards if he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I believe I can get closer to my target by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my target, and it's likely we won't be able to get any closer through further negotiation.  I'd rather secure a good price than risk losing the sale and ending up with the lower price offered by John."
