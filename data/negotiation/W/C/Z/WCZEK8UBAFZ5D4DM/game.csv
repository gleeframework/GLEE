"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000, but I'm still a bit too far from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and meet at $9,250? This would be a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
