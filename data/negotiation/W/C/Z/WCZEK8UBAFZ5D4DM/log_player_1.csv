"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's estimated value, but still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate while also showing I'm open to finding a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. There are still rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000, but I'm still a bit too far from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and meet at $9,250? This would be a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that is still above Bob's price, but closer to his last offer. I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a better price and not pushing Bob away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I'd rather meet at $9,000 than $9,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $9,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more, especially since we have a few rounds left. I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down to $9,125. This is a good price for both of us. Let's close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9125}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my previous one, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to push Bob to meet me in the middle. This is my last serious offer before I start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,125, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,125, which would be $9,062.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,062.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,062.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John.  We're almost at the end of the rounds, and it's clear that I'm unlikely to get closer to my minimum acceptable price with Bob. While $9,062.50 is a decent offer, I'd rather sell to John and get my full asking price."
