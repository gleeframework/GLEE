"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Ambitious:** This price sets a strong initial expectation and gives me leverage in the negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** This will give me a sense of Bob's interest and budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell. There's still potential to get a higher price.
* **Negotiation is key:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a fallback:** I have the safety net of John's offer, so I can take calculated risks in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but maintain leverage:** I'm coming down from my initial price, but still leaving a margin for further negotiation.
* **Testing Bob's commitment:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness about the purchase. 
* **Staying above minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum, ensuring I don't sell below my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob's offer is only $1,000 below my previous counteroffer, and significantly closer to my minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially negotiate further, the chance of getting a higher price is decreasing. It's not worth the risk of losing Bob altogether and potentially ending up with John's offer.
* **Time is a factor:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to secure a sale. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a good price and avoids further uncertainty."
