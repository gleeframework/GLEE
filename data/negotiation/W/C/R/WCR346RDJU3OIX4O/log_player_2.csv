"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500.  I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price if you have any concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,500 is a bit closer to your maximum budget, you know John is offering the product for $12,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her, or you can always go with John's guaranteed lower price."
