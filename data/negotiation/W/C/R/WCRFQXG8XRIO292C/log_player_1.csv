Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""special price,"" we subtly imply the offer might not last forever, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** While we have a guaranteed buyer at $120, it's always better to try and secure a higher price first."
