Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves space for potential negotiation (if Bob counters) while still staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a time pressure element, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high asking price and a reasonable chance of acceptance, given your backup offer from John."
