"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you.  It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to get a slightly higher price than my minimum and allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a fair price. Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,1,
