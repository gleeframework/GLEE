Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** This offer is slightly below Bob's maximum valuation but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, Alice signals the product's value while still allowing for potential counteroffers from Bob.
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** While Alice could start even higher, this offer aims to secure a significant profit without immediately alienating Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below Alice's minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). However, there's room to negotiate for a better deal.
* **Potential for a better price:**  Bob's message indicates a willingness to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, Alice can try to push for a higher price closer to his maximum valuation.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** Alice can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to work within your budget. How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your investment goals."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $1,100,000, Alice signals flexibility and a willingness to compromise. This approach often facilitates a deal.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The offered price remains comfortably above Alice's absolute minimum, ensuring a significant profit.
* **Testing Bob's Limit:** This counteroffer helps gauge how serious Bob is about purchasing the product and how much room for negotiation remains."
