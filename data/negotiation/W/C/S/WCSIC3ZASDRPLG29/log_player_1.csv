Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but I'll think carefully about my next move. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, I know he's willing to pay at least that much. Selling it to him for $7,000 would mean I'd be leaving $1,000 on the table.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get closer to the $8,000 mark. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $7,500.
