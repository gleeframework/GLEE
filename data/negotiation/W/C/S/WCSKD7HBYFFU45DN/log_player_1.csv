Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $1300000? I think this is a fair compromise.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more,  $1,300,000 is a good compromise and  a significant improvement on his initial offer. It's also higher than what I would get from John."
