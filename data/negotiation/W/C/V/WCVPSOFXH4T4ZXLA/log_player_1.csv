Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation if he's interested.  It also gives me a bit of a buffer in case I need to lower the price slightly to get a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $90 is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not that much. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering the price to $100. This is a compromise from my previous offer, and still above Bob's offer, but hopefully it shows him I'm willing to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below what I initially wanted, it's a fair price considering the negotiation process. It's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 than selling to John, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially failing."
