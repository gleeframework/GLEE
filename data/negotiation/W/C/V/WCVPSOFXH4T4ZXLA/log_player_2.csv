The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice's offer is $110. It's better to reject her offer and see if I can get a better price."

I'm offering $90 for the product. This is still a good deal for Alice, and it's closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is closer to my target price, I'm still willing to risk another round of negotiation. There's a chance I can get Alice to come down further."

I'm offering $95 for the product. This is a compromise between my last offer and Alice's current offer. I hope she will accept it."
