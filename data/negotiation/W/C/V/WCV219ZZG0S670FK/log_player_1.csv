"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, $1,750,000, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This establishes a high starting point for negotiation and allows me to see how flexible Bob is.  I'm confident that I can still get a good price even if Bob counters, and I have the option to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm going to start by lowering my price slightly to $1,500,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible, but also makes it clear that I'm not willing to go below the value of the product to me. If he rejects this offer, I will consider selling to John for $1,500,000 as that is my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,500,000. There are still rounds remaining, and I can always choose to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to $1,400,000.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value.  I believe this offer is reasonable and gives Bob a good opportunity to close the deal. If he rejects, I'll have to carefully consider my options, as I'm running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is getting closer, I'm still not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my desired value. There are still four rounds left, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price.  It's not yet time to settle for something less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's, and I'm hoping it's a price we can both agree on.  With only three rounds left, I'm getting closer to needing to make a decision, but I'm still optimistic that we can reach a deal."
