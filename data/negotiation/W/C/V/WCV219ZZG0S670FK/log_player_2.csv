"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should start with a low counteroffer to show Alice that he's serious about negotiating. This price is exactly what Bob is willing to pay, and is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This aggressive tactic could force Alice to reconsider her position, or at least start the negotiation seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. While it's lower than her first offer, it's still not a good deal for Bob. There's no reason to accept yet, as there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should continue to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice is now willing to sell the product for $1,500,000, which is closer to Bob's ideal price. This counteroffer at $1,250,000 is a compromise, showing that Bob is serious about buying the product but also pushing for a better deal. This leaves room for further negotiation while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now willing to sell for $1,400,000, which is closer to Bob's budget. However, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has 5 rounds left and the potential to save another $200,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's willing to pay a bit more than his initial counteroffer, demonstrating a commitment to the deal. However, he's also showing he's not willing to pay Alice's full asking price. This counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise, splitting the difference between the previous offers, and leaving room for one more counteroffer from Alice if needed. This also gives Bob some leverage to potentially secure the product for a slightly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's ideal price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's getting very close to the end of the negotiation period. There's a risk that Alice could reject the next counteroffer and Bob would have to buy from John.  At this point, accepting the offer minimizes the risk of getting a worse deal and ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
