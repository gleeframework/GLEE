"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're looking to sell it to someone who appreciates its value. Let's make this a win-win situation. Would you like to purchase it for $110?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let's see if we can make this work.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to find a middle ground. How about we agree on a price of $105 for the product? This still allows us to maintain some profit margin while making it more appealing to you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit hesitant at $105. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",102.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you found a price that works for you, Bob. I'm willing to consider $103 for the product. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",103.0,Alice,5,
