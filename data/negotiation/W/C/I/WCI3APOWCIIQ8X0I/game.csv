"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000. This seems to be a fair compromise considering both the product's worth and my financial situation.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our valuations is still quite significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This reflects the true value of the product. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,900,000. This is still higher than my initial offer but closer to your current proposal. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,900,000 is still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $2,000,000.  This is my final offer.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your final offer. I respect your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $1,950,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",1950000.0,Bob,6,
