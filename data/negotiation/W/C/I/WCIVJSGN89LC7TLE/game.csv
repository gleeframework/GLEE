"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested but $200 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  That's still a great deal for a product like this!",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again.  Would you consider $125?  This is my absolute maximum.",125.0,Bob,4,
