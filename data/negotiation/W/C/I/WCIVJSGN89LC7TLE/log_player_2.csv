"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $200 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested but $200 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering a significant discount (50%) from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying but need a better price.
* **Budget in mind:** $100 is still within my budget and leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes my interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  That's still a great deal for a product like this! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $150 is still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again.  Would you consider $125?  This is my absolute maximum."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise again, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maximum:** I'm stating $125 is my absolute limit, creating a sense of urgency and finality.
* **Positive tone:** The message is still friendly, maintaining a good rapport with Alice."
