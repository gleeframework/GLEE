"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $13000.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $13000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $11000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $11000, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm still firm on the value of this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12000?  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $11500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see it's a good deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
