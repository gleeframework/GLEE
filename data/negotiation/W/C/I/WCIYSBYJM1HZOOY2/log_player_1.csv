I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, as I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay that amount. 

While I know the product is worth less to Bob, I'm hoping he recognizes the value and is willing to negotiate. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a higher price, but I'm not willing to lower my offer."
