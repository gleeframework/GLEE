"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the offer, but I am looking for a better deal. Could we negotiate the price down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't go as low as $10000. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position. I would like to counter with $11000 for the product. This price still allows me to save money while being fair to you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another compromise. However, $11000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $13000? I'm confident that you'll find it's a fair price for the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet at $12000 yet. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price for the product's value and my target profit margin.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I would like to counter with $12500 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final compromise, but I need to get at least $14000 for the product. Can you meet me at $13750? It's a small step up from your previous offer, but it's the best I can do.",13750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. Considering your last offer, I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $13250 for the product. This price aims to reflect a fair compromise for both parties.",13250.0,Bob,10,
