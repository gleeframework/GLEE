"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiation, $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This reflects the product's value to you and allows for some room for compromise. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1000000 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while giving you a fair price.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
