While Alice's offer is good, it's still possible to get a better price.  There's room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring that before committing to either Alice or John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's $50,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to accept her first price.  This should open up further negotiation."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my target, but it's still a little higher than I'd like to pay. I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price.  It's still early in the negotiation, and I have more rounds to work with."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but we're still not quite there. We've got a few more rounds, and I'm not ready to accept her offer yet. I'm going to try to push for a lower price, but I'm also getting closer to considering John's offer if this doesn't work out."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}

We're running out of rounds, and while I'd like to continue negotiating, Alice's offer is getting very close to my target. It's also quite a bit lower than John's price. It's time to accept the offer and secure the purchase.  I'm confident that I've gotten a good deal considering the time constraints."
