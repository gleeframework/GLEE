Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as much money as possible. While I have a guaranteed $150 from John, it's worth trying to get more from Bob first.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to a price higher than $150.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Offering a price slightly below my maximum ensures Bob doesn't feel lowballed and increases the chance he'll accept."
