Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it will bring me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

**Reasoning:** Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his initial offer, and we are still below our minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap significantly in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees our minimum price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
