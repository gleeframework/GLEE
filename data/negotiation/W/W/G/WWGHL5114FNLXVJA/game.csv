"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to make this deal work. This price still allows me to get a good return on my investment, and it's a significant value for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low. How about $1,275,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end, and it's a price that still allows me to achieve a reasonable profit.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
