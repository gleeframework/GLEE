You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for him, and he has room to negotiate. He can try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is lower than her initial offer, it's still too high for Bob. He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. There's no reason to accept this offer when he has more negotiating rounds and a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $9,500. This shows he's willing to compromise but is still holding out for a better price. He's trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward while keeping his budget in mind."
