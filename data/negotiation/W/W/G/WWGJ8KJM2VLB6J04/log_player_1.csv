"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to capture a large portion of the potential surplus.  This is a good starting point because Bob values the product significantly higher than my minimum. I expect Bob to counter-offer, and I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me, considering the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. I'm still confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. While selling to John is a safe option, I'm willing to take a risk to potentially make more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but I'm still holding out for a significant profit.  $10,500 is a good compromise, given that Bob values the product at $15,000. I believe this offer is fair while also allowing me to get closer to my desired price. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'd love to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum of $8,000. I'm not confident that I can get a significantly better offer in the remaining rounds. Selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, but I'm willing to take a slight risk and accept Bob's offer, which guarantees me a decent profit."
