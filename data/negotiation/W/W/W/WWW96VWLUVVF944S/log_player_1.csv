Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is significantly higher than what John would offer, giving Bob a good incentive to accept. However, it still leaves room for negotiation should Bob counteroffer, ensuring I maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to demonstrate flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. This should encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price without completely shutting down the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is close enough to my desired price that it's worth accepting. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer will ensure a higher profit than selling to John and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially ending in a worse outcome."
