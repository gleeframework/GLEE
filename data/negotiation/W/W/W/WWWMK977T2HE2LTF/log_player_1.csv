Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,050,000 secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of losing Bob entirely in further rounds."
