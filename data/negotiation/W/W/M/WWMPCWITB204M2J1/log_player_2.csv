"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to you. After careful consideration and evaluation of its worth, I am offering this exceptional item to you at a price that reflects its true value and significance. My proposal is to extend the offer at a price of $1,200,000. This amount is carefully calculated to be a fair compromise between its intrinsic value to you and my expectations for the transaction. I believe this price presents an excellent opportunity for both parties involved, ensuring a mutually beneficial outcome. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if there's any other information you require before making a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might:

* **Prompt a counter-offer:** Alice might be willing to lower her price further to make the sale.
* **Give you time to negotiate:** You can use the difference between her offer and John's price as leverage to get a better deal. 

Let's see if Alice is willing to come down on her price."
