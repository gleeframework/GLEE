"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. My starting price is $9,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This allows for some room for negotiation and potentially a higher final price.  I'm also framing it positively, highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $7,500, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I'm hoping to get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable.  How about $8,200?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $7,900 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are very close to my minimum, but I'm concerned that further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum of $8,000, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
