"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point considering the minimum value of the product to me is $10,000.  I'm hoping to get a good price from Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's low offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, but I'm still prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price in the next round.  I'm aware that I'm running out of time, but I'm still determined to get a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $12,000.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's most recent offer.  I'm hoping to reach a middle ground and close the deal. However, I'm also keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John if this offer is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to hold out for a higher price, we're running out of time.  Bob's offer of $11,500 is better than selling to John, so I'm going to accept it."
