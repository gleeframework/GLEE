Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counter-offers.
* **Justification:**  While I don't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, mentioning ""its value"" hints at its worth, potentially justifying the higher price in his mind.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning listing it publicly, I subtly remind Bob that he might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so I'm not desperate and can afford to aim higher with Bob. 

This approach aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
