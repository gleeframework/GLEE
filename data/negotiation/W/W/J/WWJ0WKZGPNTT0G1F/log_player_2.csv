Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to balance that with the value I'm looking to get from the sale.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $1,150,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000, and that's already higher than John's offer. It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and secure the deal with John at your target price."
