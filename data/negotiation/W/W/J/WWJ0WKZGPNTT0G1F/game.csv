"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to balance that with the value I'm looking to get from the sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm looking to retain.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still a bit far off from what I had in mind. How about we settle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $1,150,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
