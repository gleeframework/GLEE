# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, it's still higher than your preferred price.  You have a guaranteed deal from John at $8,000.  It's time to take the safe option and buy from John."
