Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than Bob's $8,000 value, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's still above your $10,000 minimum, so you're not giving away the farm.
* **It leaves room for bargaining:**  You can adjust your price up or down depending on Bob's response and your own comfort level.

Remember, it's a negotiation, and you need to find a price that works for both of you!  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $8,500 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **I can likely get a better price:**  Bob is already showing interest, and I believe there's room to negotiate a higher price.  
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If I can't secure a price that meets my minimum, I can always sell to John for $10,000.

I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move the product without going below my minimum."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By offering $9,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Appealing to fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and potentially sway him.
* **Staying firm:**  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm also showing flexibility. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,250 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,250 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price:** Bob is clearly pushing for a price far below my desired range, and further negotiation might only result in wasted time.
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  I can guarantee a sale at my minimum price with John, ensuring a good outcome for me.  

I'm confident that selling to John is the most efficient and beneficial choice for me at this point."
