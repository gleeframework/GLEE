"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $7,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $6,800 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6800.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $7,200. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",7200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $7,200 is still a little too high for me. How about $7,000?  It's a fair price and I'm ready to close the deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a profit. I'm offering it to you for $7,100. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for this product.",7100.0,Alice,5,
