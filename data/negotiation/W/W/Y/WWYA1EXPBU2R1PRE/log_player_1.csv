Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate, feeling like he's getting a deal. It also keeps us safely above our minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150."
