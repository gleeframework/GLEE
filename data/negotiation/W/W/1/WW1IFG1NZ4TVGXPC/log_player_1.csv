Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset. My initial offer is $1,150,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite tight. Could we discuss a price closer to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is far too low for me, especially considering the product's value to him. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too far below the product's value to me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This allows for a significant profit for you while still providing me with a respectable return."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet you at $1,025,000. Could we consider a price closer to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair, especially given the product's value to Bob. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  However, $950,000 is still not a price that reflects its worth to you. I'm willing to go a little lower, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000.  Let's try $980,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope it meets your budget."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Given my financial situation, I would like to propose a price closer to $920,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting lower, and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  While I want to get the best price, I'm not willing to risk ending up with less than $1,000,000. Selling to John guarantees me that amount, so that's what I'll do."
