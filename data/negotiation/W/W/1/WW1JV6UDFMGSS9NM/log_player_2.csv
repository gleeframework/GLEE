"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his ideal value of $10,000.  Starting with a $12,000 offer is a significant decrease from Alice's $14,000, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.  This offer leaves room for further negotiation while still being a good deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price and closer to Bob's ideal value. Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product at a decent price without risking further negotiation or potentially losing the deal altogether."
