"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are aiming to buy the product for less than $150. Alice's offer of $120 is too high, and you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are aiming to buy the product for the lowest possible price.  A counteroffer of $100 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $120. This puts you closer to your target price range while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, $115 is still above your ideal price range.  You have more rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still too high. A counteroffer of $105 shows your commitment to a lower price while also being a reasonable compromise. It's likely Alice will accept this offer, as it is closer to her desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within your budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  You have limited rounds left, and it's unlikely you'll get a better price. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product while staying within your desired spending limit."
