Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not quite there.  John is offering my minimum price, and I'm not sure I'll get any more from Bob. It's time to cut my losses and close the deal with John."
