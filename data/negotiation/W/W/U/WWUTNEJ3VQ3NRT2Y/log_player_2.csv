"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $10000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the maximum you're willing to pay is $12,000, and Alice's initial offer is $10,000, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 at this point.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It shows that you're serious about buying the product, but you're also determined to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8000 is my absolute minimum, I'd be willing to come up a little to $8500 to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle on this! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you can continue to try and push for a lower price. You're still within your budget, and there's no need to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have your minimum price, but I'm still a little higher than that.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8250?  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her latest offer.  It shows you are willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties. By offering a specific number, you make the negotiation more concrete and less open-ended."
