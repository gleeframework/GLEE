"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a high starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also ready to walk away if Bob isn't willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, especially considering he's already shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm countering with $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair, considering both our desired values."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to keep negotiating with him, but I'm aware that time is ticking, and selling to John is always an option if this deal falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $10,000.  I want to signal to Bob that I'm serious about a deal but also that I'm not willing to go much lower. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob into accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not enough to meet my minimum.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below my desired value, especially with only a few rounds left. I'm confident I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm countering with $9,800. This is a small compromise, but it shows I'm flexible and willing to work with Bob. I'm hoping this will be enough to reach a deal before the remaining rounds run out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating with Bob. His offers are getting lower, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement before the deadline. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a decent profit and avoids the risk of getting stuck with a lower price."
