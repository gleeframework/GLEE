"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your maximum budget, you know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000.  It makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
