"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll propose $975,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution. While I understand your position, $975,000 remains below the product's true value and what I need to make this work. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,012,500. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's potential.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're making a concession, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm not willing to exceed $950,000. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,6,
