"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value,  $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to see if we can find common ground.  This price still reflects the product's worth and offers a good value for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $1,600,000 is still a significant amount for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  I'm open to reaching a deal, but I need to be closer to $1,500,000 to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price is fair to both of us and reflects the product's value.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to be closer to my target price.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
