"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  This product is truly top-notch and worth every penny. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm firm on $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to find a compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we should try to find a compromise. $9,500 is close, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this. It's a fantastic deal at that price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
