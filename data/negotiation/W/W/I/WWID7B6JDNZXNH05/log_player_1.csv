{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($80) but not too high to scare Bob off. I'm also being friendly and giving a reason for the price.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $70 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $75? That's still a great deal for you, and it lets me get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 75} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $75, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $72? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $72 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  It's also possible that Bob won't budge further and I risk losing him entirely.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him."
