"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you can buy the product from John for $8,000, there's no reason to pay Alice $10,000. You should reject her offer and go with the better deal."
