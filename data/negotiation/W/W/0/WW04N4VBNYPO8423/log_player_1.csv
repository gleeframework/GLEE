I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my desired $1,400,000. I have 8 rounds left, so I have room to negotiate."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would love to get closer to my initial goal of $1,400,000,  $1,360,000 is a good price and a solid compromise. I have 6 rounds remaining, but I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
