"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,800,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,800,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I have to be more realistic about its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is my best compromise, and I'm hoping we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum limit.  I need to keep negotiating to try and bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our respective needs."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,550,000 is sufficient. I'm willing to meet you at $1,575,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the value I deserve. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,575,000 is still above my budget and I only have 5 rounds left.  While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement.  It's more efficient to purchase the product from John for $1,500,000 and avoid further negotiation."
