"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $10,000 and leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to Bob is $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to Bob and my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is below my minimum value.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's getting late in the game. I'm confident John will buy the product from me for $10,000, which is a safer and more secure outcome."
