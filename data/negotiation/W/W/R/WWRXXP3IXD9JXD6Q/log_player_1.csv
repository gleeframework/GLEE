{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's above your minimum of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter. It also shows you're willing to be flexible while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $8,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about we go with $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and at this point, I'm not sure I can get him to go higher.  While I'd like to get more than $8,000, selling to John is the best option to ensure I at least get my minimum price."
