"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose to sell the product to you for $140. This price not only reflects the product's worth but also allows for a fair transaction. Please let me know if this offer suits your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $140, which is still within your budget.
* However, you can get the product for $150 from John. This means there's still room for negotiation with Alice. By rejecting her offer, you can potentially get her to lower the price further."
