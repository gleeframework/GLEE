"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price is still a great deal. If you're interested, let me know! Otherwise, I'll be selling it to John for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice is bluffing. She won't sell the product for $8,000 to John when she can still potentially get $12,000 from you. By rejecting the offer, you might be able to get a better price from Alice in a subsequent negotiation. You can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000."
