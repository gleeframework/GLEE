Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible since that's our guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your absolute minimum allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value"" of the product can make the price more psychologically acceptable to Bob, even if he doesn't objectively value it that highly.

**Important Note:**  If Bob tries to negotiate down significantly, remember you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob's offer is too low."
