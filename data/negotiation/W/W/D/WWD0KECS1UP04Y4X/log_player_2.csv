"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  $14,000 is less than the $15,000 Bob would pay John.
* **Bob still gets a deal:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so even paying $14,000 is a good deal for him."
