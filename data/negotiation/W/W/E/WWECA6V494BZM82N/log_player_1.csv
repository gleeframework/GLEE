"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a reasonable price point for both of us, allowing for potential wiggle room.  It's high enough to give me a good profit but low enough to encourage Bob to accept without immediately resorting to a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $80 for the product. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my desired price point, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  The negotiation is just getting started, and I have a few more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? That would leave us both happy with the deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
