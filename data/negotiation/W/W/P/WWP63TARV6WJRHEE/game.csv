"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. My initial offer is $1100000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, so I can only consider a price of $950000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $900000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900000. I'm willing to come down to $925000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can shake hands on this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still stuck at $900000. This is the absolute maximum I can offer. If you're willing to accept, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've reached your maximum offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $925000, which is $912500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",912500.0,Alice,7,
