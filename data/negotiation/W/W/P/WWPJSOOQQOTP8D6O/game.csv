"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, reflecting the value this product holds. I believe this price is still fair and allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
