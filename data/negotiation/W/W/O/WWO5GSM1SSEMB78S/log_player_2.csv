"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at an unbeatable price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product just as much as I do. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and you have a backup option with John. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, bringing you closer to your goal of saving as much money as possible."
