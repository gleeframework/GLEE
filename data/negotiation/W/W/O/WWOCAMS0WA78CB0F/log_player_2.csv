Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Given my budget and the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $12,000.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I am prepared to consider your offer. However, I must maintain a fair valuation for our product. Therefore, I propose a price of $13000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is $13,000:** This is closer to Bob's desired price of $12,000 and is a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice rejecting Bob's offer again, forcing Bob to accept John's higher price.
* **Saving money:** Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob saves $1,000 compared to buying from John. 

Given these factors, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice for Bob to secure the product while saving money."
