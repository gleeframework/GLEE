"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested in accepting or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $1,000,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so my counteroffer is $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my target, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so my counteroffer is $1,325,000 is too high, let me try again. My counteroffer is $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

At this point, Alice is clearly willing to negotiate but also unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $1,225,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price.  Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate or Alice hardening her position."
