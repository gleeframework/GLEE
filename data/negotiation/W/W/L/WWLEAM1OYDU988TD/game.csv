"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within a budget of $100 for this product. Would you be able to accommodate that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This still leaves me a decent profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $110? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $115. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while I appreciate the reduction, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Could you perhaps consider $110 as a final offer? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial solution.",110.0,Bob,6,
