"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $18000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product but my maximum budget is $12000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $13000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $14500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $13000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000. I'm making a final concession, and I hope you'll meet me at this price. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,7,
