"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate a price that's beneficial for both of us.
* **My Minimum:** I need to earn at least $1,000,000. 
* **Opening Offer:** A starting price of $1,400,000 is a strong opening offer, leaving room for potential concessions while still ensuring a significant profit. 

**Strategy:**

I want to start high and see if Bob is willing to bite. This strategy allows me to potentially secure a higher price while also keeping the door open for further negotiations if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob has offered $1,300,000, which is still above my minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still negotiate a better price. Bob is clearly interested, and his initial counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay a significant amount. 
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain control and potentially secure a higher price in the next round.

**Next Steps:** 

In the next round, I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is lower than my initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable range.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my initial offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $1,300,000. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** Offering $1,350,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a profit that's above my minimum.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer closer to Bob's previous offer, I'm signaling a desire to close the deal while also maintaining a firm stance on my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I believe I can achieve. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I've already rejected two offers, and Bob is clearly interested in the product. I have leverage to push for a better price.
* **Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain control and potentially secure a higher price in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price slightly above Bob's last offer, keeping in mind my goal of reaching a price closer to $1,300,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowering Offers:** Bob has been steadily lowering his offers, but I believe he still values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer meets Bob's last offer halfway, showing a willingness to compromise and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial price.
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  This price still provides me with a significant profit and is above my minimum.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated move to test the waters. I'm hoping to find a price point where Bob is willing to accept without me having to further decrease my offer. If this fails, I'll need to reassess the situation and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowering Offers:** Bob continues to lower his offer, but his actions indicate a strong desire to buy the product.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I have the upper hand in this negotiation. We are in the middle of the 10 rounds and I can still negotiate further. 
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control and potentially secure a higher price in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price slightly above Bob's last offer. I will also assess the risk of selling to John, who would offer $1,000,000 immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Consistent Lowering:** Bob has now lowered his offer three times in a row.  While he seems interested, his offers are getting closer to my minimum.
* **Midpoint Negotiation:**  My counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a midpoint between his last offer ($1,200,000) and my previous offer ($1,300,000). This shows a commitment to finding a compromise.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $1,000,000 is now a serious consideration.  I'm getting closer to the point where his offer becomes a more tempting option.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a gamble. If Bob accepts, I get a good profit.  If he rejects, I'm one round closer to having to decide between Bob and John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is now offering $1,150,000, which is getting very close to John's offer of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe Bob is willing to pay more. There are only 2 rounds left, and I'm pushing for a better price. 
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me one more round to push for a better price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will likely counter with a price slightly above Bob's offer, but still closer to my initial asking price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider John's offer in the final round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lower Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is getting dangerously close to John's offer of $1,000,000. This puts me in a tough spot with only two rounds remaining.
* **Final Push:**  This counteroffer is a final push to try and secure a deal with Bob. It's a compromise, meeting his offer halfway from my last counteroffer.
* **Risk Assessment:** If Bob rejects this offer, selling to John becomes the more likely option.

**Strategy:** 

I'm hoping this counteroffer is enough to convince Bob to close the deal. I've made a significant concession, and I'm confident that this is my best possible offer, given the circumstances and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiation with Bob.
* **Bob's Offer:**  His offer of $1,100,000 is only $100,000 higher than John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's not much room for further negotiation, and the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer is high. 

**Strategy:**

Given the circumstances, it's more sensible to accept John's offer. While it's less than I initially hoped for, it guarantees a sale and secures a profit. Holding out for a better price from Bob in the final round carries too much risk and could result in no sale at all."
