{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. This gives room for negotiation while still giving you a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm looking to keep my expenses lower. Would you be willing to consider $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'll counter with a slightly lower price hoping to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $95?  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. Considering my budget constraints, I'd like to propose $92 for the product. This would allow us to meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer more, $92 is closer to my minimum than what John is offering.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale and avoid the risk of him walking away entirely."
