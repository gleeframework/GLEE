"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this is a fair starting point considering the benefits it offers.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Considering the product's worth to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This reflects the product's true value.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,025,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
