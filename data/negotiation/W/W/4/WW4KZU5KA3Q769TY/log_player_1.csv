{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts at a high point, leaving room for negotiation. It's a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum:** $11,500 is higher than my minimum of $10,000, so I'm already in a good position.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's potential for a deal that benefits both of us.
* **It's a clear opening:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I'm not eager to settle so quickly. There's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price if I counteroffer. I have the following points in my favor:

* **Bob wants the product:** He made a counteroffer, showing interest.
* **I have leverage:** John is willing to pay $10,000, so I'm not in a desperate situation.

By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I can test the waters and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Compromises:**  It's a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Shows Flexibility:** It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlights Value:** It emphasizes the value of the product to justify the price.

I'm hopeful that Bob will find this counteroffer more appealing and we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm still very interested in purchasing the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While he is still interested, further negotiation is unlikely to get me closer to my desired price.  John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum, so it's the most sensible option at this point."
