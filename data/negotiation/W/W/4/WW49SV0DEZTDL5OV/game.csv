"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1600000? This would give you a good price and me a fair return on my investment.  Let's work towards a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1300000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1500000, but that's my final offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not sure $1500000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1200000. That's the best I can do.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
