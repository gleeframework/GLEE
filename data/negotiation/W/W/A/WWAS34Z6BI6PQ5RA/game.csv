"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1400000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting the product at a price that's within your budget and I'll be able to make a good profit. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be able to make a reasonable profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1200000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's still within your stated budget.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer $1150000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $1150000 is closer to what I'm looking for. However, I'm still not quite there.  To make this deal work for me, I need to be at $1175000. This is a fair compromise that allows me to cover my costs and also allows you to get a good deal. What do you say?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm worried that I'll be stretching my budget too thin. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer $1162500. Can you consider this revised offer?",1162500.0,Bob,6,
