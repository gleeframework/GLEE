"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than my target of $800,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a significant amount for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at $825,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000.  This is a good price, and I'm confident I can't get a much better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. I could still try to negotiate with Alice, but with only 5 rounds left, the risk of failing to reach a deal and having to buy from John at $800,000 is high. It's better to secure a deal at this price than risk losing the opportunity altogether."
