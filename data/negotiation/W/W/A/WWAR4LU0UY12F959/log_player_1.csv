Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105 is still a bit too high. Can you meet me at $105 or even $108? I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $108 is closer to my goal, I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I have several rounds left and want to see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $109? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $107? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We've been going back and forth for a while, and while I'd like to get even closer to my goal price,  $107 is still a good deal. I'm also running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer."
