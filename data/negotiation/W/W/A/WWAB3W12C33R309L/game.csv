"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a little too high for me.  How about $105?  That's a good compromise and we can both be happy.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $107. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",107.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",105.0,Bob,6,
