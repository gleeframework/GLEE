"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is better than $150, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $100, and you're willing to pay up to $150.  A counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable starting point, offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price while still leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but $125 is still too high. You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate and can likely push for a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but is still holding out for a higher price.  A counteroffer of $110 shows your commitment to reaching a deal, while still leaving room for compromise. It also splits the difference between your last offer of $105 and her current offer of $125."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still holding out for a price that's too high. You've demonstrated your willingness to negotiate and have already made concessions.  You're still better off rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate with Alice.  While you have a fallback option with John, you can potentially achieve a better deal with Alice if you continue to push."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is demonstrating a pattern of coming down by $5 with each offer. By offering $115, we continue this pattern and show a willingness to meet in the middle.  This also keeps us within the $150 limit we set for ourselves.  We are halfway through the negotiation, so it's important to show a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price that works for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still not budging much, and we're running out of rounds. However, $135 is closer to our desired price than John's offer. By rejecting and countering, we're signaling a willingness to close the deal but also putting pressure on Alice to make a more significant concession. There's still a chance she may come down further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and we've pushed Alice down to $135. We're willing to go up slightly to $120, hoping to meet Alice halfway and finalize the deal.  This counteroffer shows a strong desire to reach an agreement while still staying within our budget.  We're now only two rounds away from having to buy from John, so there's a strong incentive for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round, and Alice's offer of $140 is too high.  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price, and we're at risk of not getting the product at all.  Buying from John for $150 ensures we get the product, even if it's not the ideal price."
