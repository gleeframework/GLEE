Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum value ($12,000). This creates room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense of getting a deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting at $10,000, I leave room for Bob to counteroffer without making me feel like I need to immediately accept.
* **Alternative Option:** I've made it clear that I have another buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum price. This adds pressure for Bob to make a deal if he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9,500 for your product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum value:** While $9,500 is higher than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer. There's still room for negotiation, and I might be able to push Bob a bit higher.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. It's closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product without having to go with my other buyer."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Motivational language:** I've emphasized the benefits of this price for both of us, reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal and that I'm avoiding having to go with my other buyer. 
* **Maintain leverage:** While meeting halfway, I'm still aiming to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not willing to give in completely to Bob's offer yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses low. Would $9,500 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  We've reached a stalemate. Bob is firm on his $9,500 offer, and I'm unwilling to go below $9,750. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant price increase.
* **Guarantee:** John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.  
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially losing out on John's deal.

**Conclusion:** Selling to John is the most logical choice. It guarantees me a higher profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
