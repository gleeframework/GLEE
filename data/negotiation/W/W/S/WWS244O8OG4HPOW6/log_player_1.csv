Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
