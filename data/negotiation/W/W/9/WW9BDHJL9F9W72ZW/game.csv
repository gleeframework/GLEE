"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss the product. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,500? I'm confident we can make this deal work.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,250. This is my best and final offer.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  $10,250 is getting closer, but I'm still just a bit over budget.  Would you be willing to go to $9,750? This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering we're both trying to make a deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
