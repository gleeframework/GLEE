"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $95. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Get as close to your maximum budget as possible.
