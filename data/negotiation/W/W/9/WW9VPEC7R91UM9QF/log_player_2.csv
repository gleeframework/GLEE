"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount, and it's an opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a great price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. If I buy from her, I'll be paying $12,000, which is more than the $8,000 she values the product at, so I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I'll see what John has to offer.
