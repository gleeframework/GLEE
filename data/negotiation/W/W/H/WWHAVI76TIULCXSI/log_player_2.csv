"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think you'd be a perfect buyer. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly.  I'm willing to engage in a few rounds of counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting with a very low counteroffer ($80) gives us a lot of room to negotiate upwards.  This strategy aims to see how flexible Alice is and if she's really motivated to sell.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a low number first, we're trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to our desired price range.

It's a risky move, as Alice might find it too low and walk away. However, it's early in the negotiation, and we have time to adjust if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, but $140 is still too high. While it's closer to a potential compromise, we have room to negotiate further, especially since we know John offers the product at $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** We're moving up from $80 to $100, signaling to Alice that we are willing to negotiate but staying firm on getting a significant discount.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $100 is a strong psychological price point and a significant savings compared to her offer of $140. It keeps us in the game while aiming for a price closer to our target. 
* **Time Consideration:**  We are still in the early rounds, and this offer leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about $120 and we close the deal right now? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our maximum price.  There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further, as we can get the product for the same price from John. Accepting now ensures we get the product at our target price."
