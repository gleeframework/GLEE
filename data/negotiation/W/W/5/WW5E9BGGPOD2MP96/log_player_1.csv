"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:** I'm highlighting the value of the product for him, emphasizing that it's a good deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, as I want to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,500 is still below my minimum value of $12,000.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than that, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 
* **There are still 8 rounds left.**  I have time to negotiate further with Bob and try to reach a higher price. 
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800 to make this work.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both get a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to Bob's offer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still holding out for a higher price. 
* **Justifying the price:**  I'm explaining why my counteroffer is reasonable, referencing the value of the product.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the need to reach an agreement to make it work for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to pay $9,600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $9,600 is still below my minimum value of $12,000.
* **Time is on my side:** I've got 6 rounds left and John is a guaranteed buyer at $12,000.  There's no reason to settle for less just yet.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price in the next rounds. There's always a chance he'll come up to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,600 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,700.  This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession by moving up to $9,700, but I'm still holding out for a higher price than Bob's offer. 
* **Compromise language:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a compromise and highlighting its fairness to encourage Bob's acceptance.
* **Time pressure:** While I have time, it's good to show that I'm moving towards a final deal, as the rounds are starting to decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, Alice. I am willing to pay $9,650 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $9,650 is still below my minimum value of $12,000.
* **Limited time:** While time is still on my side, I'm running out of rounds. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I'm only 4 rounds away from having to sell to John.  There's still a chance that Bob might come up to a more acceptable price. 

**Next move:**  I'll make a final counteroffer, aiming to push Bob as close to $10,000 as possible. If he rejects, I might be forced to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close!  I'm willing to go down to $9,750.  This is a final price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement.  I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great investment.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm clearly stating this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Appealing to reason:** I'm using the same tactics as before, emphasizing value and a fair deal.
* **Time urgency:** I'm making it clear that the deal is close to falling apart, but I'm still leaving the door open for a quick agreement. 

I'm willing to come down to $9,750, as I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $12,000. However, I'm also holding firm, as I believe this is still a good price for me and gives Bob a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for coming down on price, Alice. I am willing to pay $9,700 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my target:** $9,700 is very close to my minimum target of $9,750. This is a good outcome given the limited rounds remaining.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I only have two rounds left. There's a high risk that Bob will either counteroffer lower or simply walk away, forcing me to sell to John at $12,000. 
* **Time pressure:** It's a good idea to take the offer now, as I'm likely to get a better deal than selling to John. 

**Conclusion:** While I could try to push for another $50, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
