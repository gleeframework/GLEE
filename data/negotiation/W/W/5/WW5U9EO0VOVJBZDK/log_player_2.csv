# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer ($1,100,000) is below your maximum price ($1,200,000), but still significantly higher than her own valuation ($800,000). 
* There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal.
* You have a backup option with John, ensuring you can still get the product if negotiations with Alice fail."
