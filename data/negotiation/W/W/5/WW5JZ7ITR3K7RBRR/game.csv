"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit high for me.  Considering the value you put on it at $12,000, I'm willing to offer $13,000. This would give you a good profit and leave room for me to enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value. While $18,000 might have been a bit ambitious, I'm aiming for something closer to $16,000.  This price reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. How about we meet halfway at $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,500 is still a bit high for me.  Given your valuation of the product at $12,000, I think $13,500 is a fair compromise. It's a good price for both of us, allowing you a decent profit and me the opportunity to get the product within my budget. What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective and how we're finding common ground.  To be completely transparent, $12,000 is the absolute lowest I can go for this product. However, because I value our interaction and believe you'll truly benefit from this, I'm willing to make a final offer of $13,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see you get this product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
