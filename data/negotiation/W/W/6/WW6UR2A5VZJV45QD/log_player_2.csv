"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice's offer of $95 is too high, but still within your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. It's a better strategy than immediately buying from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice values the product at $80, offering $85 gives her a reasonable profit margin while still being a significant discount for you compared to her initial offer of $95. This counteroffer also leaves room for potential negotiation if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $90 is still a good deal for you. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to your desired price range.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting your next counteroffer or you ending up paying $100 to John is too high. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price."
