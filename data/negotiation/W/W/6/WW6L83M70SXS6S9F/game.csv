"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your company.  I'm confident it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at $950,000.  This price reflects the significant value you'll derive from the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a significant discount and a fair starting point for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This price still reflects the significant value you'll gain from the product.  Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still too high. I believe $875,000 is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me and the need for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try to bridge the gap and finalize a deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $875,000 still falls below my minimum expectation. I am willing to come down to $890,000, reflecting a significant compromise on my end. I believe this price is fair given the value the product will bring to your company. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",890000.0,Alice,5,
