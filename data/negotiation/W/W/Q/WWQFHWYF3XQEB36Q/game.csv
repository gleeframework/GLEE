"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. I'll make you an offer of $1,600,000. It's higher than my previous proposal and closer to your initial offer, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
