"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leverage the potential for negotiation and maximize my earnings.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,500. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to close the deal without resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject it and continue negotiating. I'm hoping to push him a bit closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12200}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $12,200.  This is still above Bob's last offer, but it shows my willingness to negotiate and hopefully encourages him to meet me in the middle.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I don't want to risk losing him by being too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Negotiations have stalled, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum.  With limited rounds remaining, it's not worth risking a further decrease in price. I'll sell the product to John for $12,000, ensuring I meet my minimum goal."
