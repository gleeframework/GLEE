Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it's a great deal at $180."",
""product_price"": 180
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), you can afford to start negotiations higher.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $180 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down, while still ensuring you make a profit above your minimum. 
* **""Exclusive Offer"" Framing:** By mentioning you are offering it to Bob before a public listing, you create a sense of scarcity and value.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible approach. Gauging Bob's personality and your relationship with him could influence your offer. For example, if you know Bob is very price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective."
