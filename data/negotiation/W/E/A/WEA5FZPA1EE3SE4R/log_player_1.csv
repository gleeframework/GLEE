Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Above Bob's Value, Below Your Minimum:** The offered price of $145 is higher than what Bob values the product at ($120), but it's still a price you're willing to accept as it's above your minimum ($150).
* **Potential for Profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept the $145 price, netting you a profit. If he rejects it, you haven't lost anything because you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150."
