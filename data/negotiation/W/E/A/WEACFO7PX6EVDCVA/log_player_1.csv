Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115 for it."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:**  John provides a safety net at $100, but you aim higher.

By offering the product at $115, you're:

* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, but you're still above your minimum.
* **Maximizing potential profit:** If Bob accepts, you've made the best possible deal.
* **Staying above John's offer:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John."
