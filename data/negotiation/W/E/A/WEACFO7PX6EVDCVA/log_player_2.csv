"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $115 is close to your maximum budget, you can still try to get a lower price. You have the fallback option of buying from John for $120."
