"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $140? It's still a great deal considering its value and would make this transaction worthwhile for both of us. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
