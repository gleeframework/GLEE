It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

Let's see if Alice will accept $80.  It's a fair price considering the product is worth no more than $100 to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

$85 is a good price, and I'm not sure I can get it lower. It's better than paying $100 to John."
