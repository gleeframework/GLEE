{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's an interesting product, but I'm going to need to come in lower than that. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to come in lower, Bob. However, I have to consider my own bottom line. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $1,600,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,550,000, which is just $50,000 more than your last offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but I need to stick to my budget. I can't go higher than $1,500,000. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to look at other options. "", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept it yet. I'm willing to make one last push to meet you in the middle. How about $1,525,000? It's just $25,000 more than your final offer, and I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While Alice has come down to a price that is only $25,000 higher than what Bob wants to pay, it's still more than he's willing to pay. It's better to buy from John and get the product for the desired price."
