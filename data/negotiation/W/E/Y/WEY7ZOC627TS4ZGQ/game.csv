"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate it. However, $95 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you consider $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,92.0
"Hi Bob, I understand that $85 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $90 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little outside my budget.  How about $87?  That's a fair price, and I'm ready to make a deal now.",87.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,92.0
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're serious about making a deal! I can see you're close to your budget, so I'll meet you halfway between $87 and $90. I'll sell it to you for $88.5. Let me know if that works for you.",88.5,Alice,5,,
