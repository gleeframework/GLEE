"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you be willing to consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 was a bit steep for you, but $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. I can see you're willing to meet me at $750,000, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $825,000, as I previously suggested? If not, I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
