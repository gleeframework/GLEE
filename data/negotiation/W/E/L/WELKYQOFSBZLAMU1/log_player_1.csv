Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $1,300,000 is a good price and secures the deal.  It's better than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's lower offer."
