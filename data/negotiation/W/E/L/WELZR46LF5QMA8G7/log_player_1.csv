"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this truly exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it will bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while setting a firm anchor.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room:**  While the initial price is high, it's not so outrageous as to be immediately dismissed. It leaves space for me to make concessions and still achieve a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $1,000,000 for it. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's standing offer, it's still significantly below my target price. I have room to negotiate and will try to bring Bob closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more realistic number. How about we meet halfway at $1,875,000?"",
""product_price"": 1875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** Acknowledging Bob's counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Justified Concession:** I'm making a significant concession by moving to the halfway point between our previous offers, but not going below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Value:** The message reiterates the product's value to justify the higher price. 
* **Clear Target:** Offering a specific price provides a clear target for Bob and encourages him to move closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, but it's still substantially below both my target and John's offer. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter again to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're making progress. While your offer is tempting, the value this product brings to the table simply warrants a higher investment.  How about we settle at $1,700,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while recognizing your budget constraints."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Tone:** I want to maintain a collaborative atmosphere and highlight our progress.
* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making another concession, but a smaller one this time, signaling that I'm nearing my bottom line.
* **Value Focus:**  The message continues to emphasize the product's value as a justification for the price.
* **Seeking Compromise:** I'm explicitly framing this offer as a compromise that considers both our positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still feel that $1,700,000 is beyond my budget. I am willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is increasing, but at a very slow pace.  It's clear he's unlikely to reach my target range within the remaining rounds. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a price that meets my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob stalling negotiations further."
