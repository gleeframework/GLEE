"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal and worth every penny! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm very interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100? I think that's a fair price."",

}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to start the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but still leaving room for negotiation. It also conveys a strong interest in the product to encourage Alice to continue the bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our acceptable price, but we can still try to push a bit further down before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $125 is getting closer. I can do $110, and I promise that's the best I can offer."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counter-offer shows Alice we are willing to move, but also sets a firm limit. By stating it's our best offer, we hope Alice will accept or at least make a small concession to close the deal."
