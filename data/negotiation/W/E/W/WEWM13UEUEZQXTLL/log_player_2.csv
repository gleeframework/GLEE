Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we've been dancing around the price for a while now, Bob. I'm starting to think that $1,000,000 is a fair price, but I'm not ready to give it away just yet. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $1,005,000? It's a small concession, but I'm willing to meet you halfway

It's unlikely we'll get Alice much lower than this. Accepting at $1,005,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's price."
