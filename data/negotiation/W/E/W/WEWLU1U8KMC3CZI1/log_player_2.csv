Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $820,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $860,000?  It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal.
