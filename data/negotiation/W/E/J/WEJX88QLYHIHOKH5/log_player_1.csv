Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net.  Alice can afford to be more ambitious in her offer to Bob.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price."
