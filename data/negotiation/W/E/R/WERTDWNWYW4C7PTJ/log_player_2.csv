"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer.  There's a lot of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counter-offer gives you room to negotiate upwards. It also helps gauge Alice's willingness to lower the price significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $20,000 represents fair value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  I believe this price reflects a good balance. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice lowered her price but it's still above your ideal price and what John is offering. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for considering my previous offer, Alice.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work.  Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer moves closer to the midpoint between your initial offer and Alice's revised price.  It shows you're willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary below your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. How about we settle on $15,500? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down considerably, but her ""final offer"" is still above John's price. You've made good progress in the negotiation, but it's not worth going over budget when you have a guaranteed offer at $15,000 from John."
