"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than what you'd pay John, there's still room for negotiation to save money. 
* **Negotiation is worth it:** You have 10 rounds to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing your willingness to negotiate, but still reasonable given her value of $800,000.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes that the price is a ""good deal for both of us"", aiming to build a cooperative atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product holds for you, while also allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:**  While she came down from her initial offer, $950,000 is still more than you want to pay.
* **Potential for better deal:** You have more rounds to negotiate, and there's still a good chance you can get a price closer to your target. 
* **No need to rush:**  Buying from John is still an option, so you have time to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $925,000. I believe this price is fair and will allow us to reach a deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer, showing you're serious about reaching a compromise.
* **Emphasis on Speed:** The message highlights the ""quick deal"" aspect, suggesting a willingness to close the deal if the price is right. This could encourage Alice to accept.
* **Staying Within Your Budget:**  $925,000 is still within your budget and allows for some wiggle room in case Alice needs to come down a bit more."
