"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and it allows you to secure a valuable asset at a competitive price. I understand it's a significant investment, so please take your time to consider it. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. However, I would prefer to work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
