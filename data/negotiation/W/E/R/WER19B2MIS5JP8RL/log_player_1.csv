Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it holds great value for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to start with a higher offer to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $20,000 offer isn't ridiculously high, leaving room for Bob to negotiate if he finds it slightly expensive.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's worth and uniqueness, subtly justifying the higher price.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while acknowledging I have a fallback option with John."
