"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This leaves a good margin for me while still being attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $15,000. This is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me a good profit while also being more appealing to Bob than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, this offer is significantly better than selling to John for $12,000, and there's a good chance we'll continue to negotiate and reach a higher price in the remaining rounds."
