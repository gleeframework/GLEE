"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the enthusiasm behind the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8000? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $8000, as that's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the effort to reach a compromise. While $9000 is closer to my target, I still feel we can find a solution that works for both of us. Could you possibly lower the price to $8500? This would be a fair compromise between our positions.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $8500, as that's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. While $8750 is a reasonable step towards a compromise, I still aim to stay within my financial limits. Could you consider lowering the price to $8500? This would be a significant improvement from your previous offer and would help us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Bob,6,
