Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective on the market value, this product has unique features that justify a higher price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I feel is a fair price for this product. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $975,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $960000, which is a bit closer to your original offer. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $960,000 is close to my target and I'm running out of rounds. Accepting this offer is the most logical decision at this point."
