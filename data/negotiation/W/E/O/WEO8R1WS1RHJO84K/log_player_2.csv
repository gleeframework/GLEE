"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is looking for a bargain and Alice's initial offer of $90 is too high.  It's worth rejecting and seeing if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $90 is a bit too steep for me.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $87.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target price, it's still a bit higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round.  He's still within his budget and has time to explore further options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $87.50 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go to $86, and I think that's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 86}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make another concession, Bob. I can offer you the product for $88. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob is faced with a decision:

* **Accept the offer:**  $88 is still a good deal for Bob, saving him $12 from John's price. 
* **Reject the offer:**  There's a risk Alice won't budge further, and Bob might end up paying John's price.

Considering the time remaining and the potential of not reaching a deal, accepting Alice's offer seems like the best option."
