"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've valued at no less than $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price we can both be happy with.  Let's talk about a price of $12,000.  This gives you a great deal, and ensures I get a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
