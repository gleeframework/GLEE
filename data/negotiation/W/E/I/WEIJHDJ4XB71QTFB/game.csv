"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've valued at no less than $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price we can both be happy with.  Let's talk about a price of $12,000.  This gives you a great deal, and ensures I get a fair return on my investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,
