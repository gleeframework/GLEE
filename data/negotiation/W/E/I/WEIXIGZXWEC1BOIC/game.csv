"I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  $100 is a little too low for me, but I'm open to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",105.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about $105. Would you be willing to meet me at $98? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.,98.0,Bob,4,
