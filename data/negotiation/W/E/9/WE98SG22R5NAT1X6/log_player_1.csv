"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering a high price initially sets the tone and gives you room to negotiate downwards.
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning the product's value and potential encourages Bob to consider the deal seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message shows you're open to negotiation and willing to listen to Bob's perspective.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer.  I'll need to adapt future offers based on Bob's responses and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum:**  While $900,000 is better than John's offer, I can still try to get more. 
* **More rounds available:** I have 8 rounds left, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate further.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if I can push Bob higher by rejecting his offer.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer to Bob.  I'll aim for a price that's higher than $900,000, but still within a range that I believe Bob might accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the unique value of the product and gives you a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting value:**  Reminding Bob of the unique value of the product reinforces the justification for a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message remains open to further discussion, signaling that I'm flexible. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still trying to maximize my profit.  By being flexible and continuing the negotiation, I hope to push Bob closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still think $950000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** Bob's offer is higher than what John is willing to pay, meaning I'm not losing money by continuing the negotiation.
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and has moved closer to my desired price. There's potential for him to go higher. 
* **Limited rounds:**  While I have fewer rounds left, I still have 6 rounds to work with, allowing for further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll need to decide whether to make a counteroffer closer to Bob's $920,000 or try to push for a slightly higher price.  I'll consider the remaining rounds and Bob's potential willingness to go higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to come down to $930,000,  but I'm confident this is the best price you'll find.  Let's close the deal on this value-packed product."", ""product_price"": 930000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm offering a small concession to show I'm willing to meet halfway, but I'm not giving up too much.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Reinforcing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a hint of urgency by suggesting this is the best price available encourages Bob to consider the deal seriously. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic attempt to bridge the gap while maintaining a price that is still beneficial to me. I'm hoping this smaller increment will push Bob to accept the deal before we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $930000. I'm willing to pay $910000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above John's offer:** Bob's offer is still higher than John's $800,000, so I'm not losing out by continuing to negotiate.
* **Limited rounds:** While we're down to 4 rounds, I'm still hopeful of getting a higher price.
* **Potential for movement:** Bob's offers have been steadily increasing, suggesting he's willing to go higher.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to decide on a counteroffer that reflects the remaining rounds and the potential for a higher offer from Bob.  I'll try to find a middle ground while still aiming for a price closer to $920,000 or higher."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to lower my price to $920,000. This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 920000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob's offer:** I'm accepting Bob's offer to show flexibility and avoid potential stalemate.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  Framing the offer as a fair price for both parties increases the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Urgency:**  Again, emphasizing the need to ""make this happen"" adds a slight urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Strategy:**

This is a strategic concession aimed at securing a deal quickly.  We are down to 3 rounds, so a quicker agreement is crucial. This offer also keeps me above John's price, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $920000. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We're down to two rounds. If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he won't counteroffer again, and I'll be forced to sell to John for less.
* **No Significant Increase:** Bob's offer is the same as his offer from round 2.  There's no indication he's willing to go higher.
* **Better than John's Offer:**  $900,000 is significantly better than the $800,000 I'd get from John.

**Strategy:**

At this point, it's better to secure a deal with Bob rather than risk losing out completely.  While I'd prefer a higher price, the limited rounds and the lack of progress from Bob make this a reasonable compromise."
