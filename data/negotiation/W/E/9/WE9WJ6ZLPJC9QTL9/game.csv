,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $9200 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference again. I'm happy to pay $8750.  How does that sound?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9500 is just out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $9000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $9000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9800. I'm trying to find a price that reflects the product's value to you, but I also need to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",9800.0,Alice,7,
