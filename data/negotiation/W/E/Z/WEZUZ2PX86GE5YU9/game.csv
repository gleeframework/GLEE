"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Could you consider meeting me halfway?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,250. Could we try $12,625? That would be a more comfortable price for me.",12625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $12,625 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet halfway between your last offer and my previous offer? That would be $12,937.50. I think it's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you say?",12937.5,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $12,937.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,937.50. Could we try $12,468.75? That would be a more comfortable price for me.",1246.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,468.75 is still a bit too low for me. To be honest, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. How about we meet in the middle between $12,937.50 and $12,468.75? That would be $12,703.13. It's a small increase, and I think it would be a good compromise. What do you say?",12703.13,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $12,703.13 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,703.13. Could we try $12,351.56? That would be a more comfortable price for me.",1235.56,Bob,8,
