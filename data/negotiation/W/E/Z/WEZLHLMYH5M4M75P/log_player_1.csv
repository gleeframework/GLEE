"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is an aggressive opening offer, but it's based on the fact that the product is worth at least $800,000 to me. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a higher price in the next round. I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I believe this offer is fair and gives Bob room to negotiate further if he's still interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is above my minimum value of $800,000.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for a lower amount.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
