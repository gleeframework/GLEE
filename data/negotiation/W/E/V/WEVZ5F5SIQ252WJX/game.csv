"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $950000. This is a fair price that allows you to acquire this valuable asset while still providing me with a reasonable profit.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,3,
