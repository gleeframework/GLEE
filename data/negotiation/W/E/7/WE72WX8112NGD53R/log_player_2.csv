Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1400000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $1,550,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1575000. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to get a fair price for this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. While we're getting closer, it's unlikely that she'll drop her price enough to be within my budget.  I'm better off buying from John for $1,500,000 to avoid further negotiation."
