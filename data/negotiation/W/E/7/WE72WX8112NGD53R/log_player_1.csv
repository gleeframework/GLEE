Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
