Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 100}
