"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. I understand it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's fair for both of us. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal, as it's well below its value to you while still allowing me to achieve a healthy profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
