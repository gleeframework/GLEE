"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you'll be getting a valuable product at a good price, and I'll be able to move it quickly. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $850,000. This is my best offer, and it would still be a good deal for you since you're getting a quick sale. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that will allow both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen!",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. While I'm eager to make a deal, $900,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives you a great deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's finalize this and make it happen!",925000.0,Alice,5,
