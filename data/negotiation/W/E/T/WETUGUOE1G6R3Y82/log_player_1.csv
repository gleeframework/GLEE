Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 (your fallback offer from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. Any price within this range can be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA to maximize your profit. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value.""  
* **Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves you room to negotiate down slightly if needed while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher within the ZOPA.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive initial offer might be preferable."
