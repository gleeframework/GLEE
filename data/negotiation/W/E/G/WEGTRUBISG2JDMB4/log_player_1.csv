"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit.  I'll be keeping a close eye on Bob's reactions to see if I need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price.  I'm confident I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $175. This is still a decent profit for me, and hopefully, it's appealing enough for Bob to consider. I'm willing to be flexible, but I won't go any lower than $150, which is my absolute minimum.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $150.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price.  If not, I'm happy to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price a little bit to $160. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still firm about getting a fair price. I'm hoping this will make him more receptive to a deal. If he rejects this, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm not going to sell for less than $150. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a little more. If not, selling to John is my next step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still trying to squeeze out a little more. $155 is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, it's enough to convince Bob to close the deal.  If not, I'll be ready to sell to John."
