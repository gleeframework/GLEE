"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, while still being a reasonable price for Alice considering her minimum of $800,000. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and is within Bob's budget.  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting and pushing the price closer to John's is too high. Accepting the offer is the best course of action to ensure a good deal and secure the product."
