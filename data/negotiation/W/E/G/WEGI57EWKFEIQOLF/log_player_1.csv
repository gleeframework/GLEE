Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get as much value as possible.
* **Value for Bob:** This offer is still attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I create room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential middle ground that is still favorable for me.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Keeping John's offer in mind ($800,000), I'm willing to negotiate with Bob but won't accept a price lower than my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer of $950,000 is higher than John's offer, it is still below my desired price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there is still room for negotiation, as Bob is clearly willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that reflects a price closer to my desired value, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving Closer:** My counteroffer of $1,100,000 moves closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This offer still maintains a significant profit margin for me, as it's well above my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Dynamics:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation, potentially leading to a price that satisfies both of us."
