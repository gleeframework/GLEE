"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $13000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. ",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity.",11500.0,Alice,5,
