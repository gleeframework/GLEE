Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  There's a potential profit margin of $700,000 ($1,500,000 - $800,000). By offering the product at $1,300,000, you aim to secure a significant portion of that profit while still offering Bob a price lower than his perceived value. 

**Important:** This is a starting point for negotiation. Bob may counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or risk losing the sale to him."
