Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm interested in selling you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your absolute minimum. This gives you room to come down during the negotiation process. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Aiming closer to $1,500,000 (Bob's perceived value) increases the chances of him accepting, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While $1,300,000 is a strong opening, it's important to remember I have John as a backup. If Bob drastically counters, I can always walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is substantial, it's a significant drop from my initial ask and still leaves a large gap between his offer and his perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation. I'm not ready to settle for $800,000 (John's offer) just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, I believe my initial offer was justified given the product's unique value proposition.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer ($1,300,000) and Bob's offer ($1,000,000), but leans slightly more in my favor. 
* **Showing Flexibility:**  By moving off my initial price, I demonstrate willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counteroffer is still significantly higher than my safety net ($800,000 from John), allowing me to continue negotiating from a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to meet you in the middle, so I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could likely push for a slightly higher price in further rounds, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate value, whereas prolonging negotiations delays the realization of this profit."
