"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise. It's still a good deal for you considering your value of $10,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $10,000. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
