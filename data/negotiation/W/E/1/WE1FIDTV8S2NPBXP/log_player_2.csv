"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's too risky to accept at this point. I will reject the offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round.  I'm also considering buying from John at this point, as his price is significantly lower and I'm getting closer to the final round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise. It's still a good deal for you considering your value of $10,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $10,000. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating, with only 5 rounds left and her stating this is her final offer, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  It's more prudent to take the guaranteed deal with John for $8,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget."
