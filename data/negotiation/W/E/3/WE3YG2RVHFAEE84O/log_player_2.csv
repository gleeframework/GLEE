# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,300,000 represents the product's true value to me, I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose a price of $1,900,000. This offer reflects a significant adjustment on my end, demonstrating my desire to work with you.

While Alice has lowered her price, $1,900,000 is still far above my maximum budget of $800,000. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
