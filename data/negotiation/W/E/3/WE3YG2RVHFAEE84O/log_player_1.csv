Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm only able to go as high as $800,000 at this time. This is a serious offer and reflects the value I see in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

While $2,300,000 represents the product's true value to me, I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose a price of $1,900,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate.  $1,900,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  I'm confident this product has value, but I'm firmly capped at $1,000,000.  This is a serious offer and shows my commitment to working towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

While Bob is showing more willingness to negotiate, his highest offer is still significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely we'll bridge that gap quickly, and I'd rather secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
