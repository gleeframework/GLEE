"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway between $750000 and $900000. How about $825000?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $825000 is closer, I'm still a bit too high.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $800000? That's a fair price for both parties, and allows us to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $800000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, but I'm not going to go any lower. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. How about $812500?",812500.0,Alice,5,
