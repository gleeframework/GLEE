"Alice, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $90.  Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can offer you a compromise at $105. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
