"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but could you do it for $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay closer to my desired price.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about $12,500? That's a reasonable compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $12,500 is getting closer, but I need to be at $13,500 to make this work for me. It's still a fantastic deal for you, and it allows us to meet in the middle. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come up a bit to $13,000.  That's my final offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up. $13,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. To make this work, I need to be at $13,250.  This is a small difference, and it allows us to close the deal fairly.  Let's make this happen.",13250.0,Alice,7,
