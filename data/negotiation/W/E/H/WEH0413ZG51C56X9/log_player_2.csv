Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but could you do it for $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay closer to my desired price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $12,500 is getting closer, but I need to be at $13,500 to make this work for me. It's still a fantastic deal for you, and it allows us to meet in the middle. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up. $13,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. To make this work, I need to be at $13,250.  This is a small difference, and it allows us to close the deal fairly.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Reasoning:

Alice is very slowly lowering her price, and it's unlikely she'll go below $13,000.  While we could continue negotiating, buying from John guarantees the product at our target price of $10,000. It's not worth the risk of Alice not going low enough in the remaining rounds."
