"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I think it will be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can we meet in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet closer to the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to go up to $11,500. Can we meet there?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is close, but the product is truly worth more. Would you consider $13,000? It's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Alice. I can see the value in the product, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. That's the absolute max I can go.",12500.0,Bob,6,
