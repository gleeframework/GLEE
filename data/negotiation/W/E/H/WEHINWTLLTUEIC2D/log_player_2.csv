"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to you, and I believe it's also valuable to me at $75. Let's work together to find a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $75 is decent, there's room for negotiation. She's already indicated it's worth less to her ($75) than it is to you ($80). By rejecting her initial offer and making a counteroffer, you might be able to secure a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product. How about we meet in the middle at $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Aiming for a price of $65 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but is still within a reasonable range.
* **Respectful Communication:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer and proposes a compromise rather than being confrontational. This sets a positive tone for negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price.  If she completely rejects it, we know we'll likely need to move closer to her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. I'm willing to consider your offer, but let's aim for a bit more alignment. How about we set the product price at $70? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice meeting in the middle at $70 is a fair compromise. We've successfully negotiated a $10 discount from her original offer.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly lower price, but the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting now secures the product and avoids further back-and-forth. 
* **Alternative:** While John offers the product at $80, Alice's current offer is a better deal."
