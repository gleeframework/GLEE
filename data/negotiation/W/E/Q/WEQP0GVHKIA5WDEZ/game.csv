"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm thinking more along the lines of $160. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $160, which would be $140. Would you be willing to consider that price?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $150 for the product. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $145, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit worried that we're not going to meet in the middle, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $155, which is my absolute lowest price. If you're still interested, let me know!",155.0,Alice,7,
