Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point - it's more than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation if he counters.  I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum of $120 if needed, but I'm starting with a fair offer to see if we can agree quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
``` 

I'm offering $105, which is a compromise. It's still above Bob's offer, but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  This hopefully leads to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher, and $90 is still significantly below my minimum of $120. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, securing $120 is the best option at this point."
