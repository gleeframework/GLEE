"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $15,500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
