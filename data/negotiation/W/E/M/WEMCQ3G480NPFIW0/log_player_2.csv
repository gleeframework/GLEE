"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though you value the product at $150, Alice is offering it for $120, saving you $30. 
* **It's within your budget:** $120 is less than your $150 limit. 
* **You're getting a good deal:** The product is worth $80 to Alice, so you're getting it for a price that's higher than her valuation, but still a good deal for you."
