"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe you'll find it extremely valuable, but I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer is above your budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than your budget. You can try to counteroffer again, but it seems like you're approaching your limit with Alice."
