"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe you'll find it extremely valuable, but I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1500000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1100000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1100000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1150000. This is my final counteroffer, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
