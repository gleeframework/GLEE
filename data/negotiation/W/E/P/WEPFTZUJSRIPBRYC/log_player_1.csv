Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially higher profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $1,100,000 positions the product as high-value to Bob while leaving space to potentially meet in the middle if he counters.
* **Alternative Buyer Leverage:**  Mentioning the ""exclusive opportunity"" subtly implies I have other interested buyers (John), creating a sense of urgency without explicitly revealing my fallback."
