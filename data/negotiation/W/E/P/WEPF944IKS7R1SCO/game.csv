"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity with significant value. My starting price is $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's significantly lower than what I need to accept. I understand your budget constraints, but this product truly has exceptional value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price still reflects the product's value while acknowledging your concerns.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to get the best price, but $1,700,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise.  I'm eager to work with you to finalize a deal, but this is the highest price I can go.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  $1,000,000 is a step in the right direction, but we still have a bit of a gap to bridge.  To show my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's value while giving you a more favorable deal.  Let's work together to finalize this transaction.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $1,600,000 is closer to my goal, it's still not within my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This is a substantial compromise that reflects the product's value and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm hopeful we can finalize this transaction with this offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a good offer, it's still slightly below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a substantial compromise on my part, and it's a price that reflects the product's value while allowing us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal and make it a win-win for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
