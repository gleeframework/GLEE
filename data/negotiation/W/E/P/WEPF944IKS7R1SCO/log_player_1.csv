"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity with significant value. My starting price is $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Price:**  I'm starting high ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation and ensure I get the most profit possible.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Confidence:** I express confidence in finding a mutually beneficial price. This helps convey my conviction in the product's value. 

**Strategy:**

The first round is crucial for setting the tone.  I want to:

* **Maximize my initial advantage:** By starting high, I establish my desired price point from the outset.
* **Encourage Bob's engagement:** The positive tone and confidence help Bob feel like the negotiation is worth his time.
* **Reserve the option to sell to John:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still walk away with a good profit by selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's crucial for me to hold firm and not settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate and have other options (selling to John). This strengthens my negotiating position.
* **Counteroffer in Round 3:** I will use the next round to send a counteroffer closer to my desired price point.  This will allow for further negotiation without immediately walking away.
* **Balancing Profit and Deal Closing:** While I want to maximize profit, I also need to be realistic. Selling to John guarantees a good profit, but it also eliminates any potential for a better deal with Bob.  I'll keep this in mind throughout the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's significantly lower than what I need to accept. I understand your budget constraints, but this product truly has exceptional value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price still reflects the product's value while acknowledging your concerns."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price, but I'm still aiming for a substantial profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the product's exceptional value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Bridging the Gap:** The message focuses on finding a compromise that addresses both our needs.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, testing Bob's willingness to come closer to my desired price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By refusing Bob's initial offer and offering a significantly higher counteroffer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate for a sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I've left some room for further negotiation, as Bob may be willing to increase his offer slightly.
* **Preparing for Option 3:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to consider selling to John in the next round. However, I'm hoping this offer will entice him to keep negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to get the best price, but $1,700,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise.  I'm eager to work with you to finalize a deal, but this is the highest price I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant improvement, it still falls short of my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I need to continue negotiating to secure a price closer to my desired value.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product.  This pressure will encourage him to make a higher offer.
* **Counteroffer with a Smaller Reduction:** In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that is a smaller reduction from my previous offer, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate further but not at a drastic rate.
* **Remaining Open to John:**  While I'm still open to selling to John, I want to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob. However, I'm aware that time is running out, so I'll need to be decisive in the coming rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  $1,000,000 is a step in the right direction, but we still have a bit of a gap to bridge.  To show my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's value while giving you a more favorable deal.  Let's work together to finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Smaller Reduction:**  I've reduced my offer by only $100,000, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a rapid pace. This shows I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** I reiterate that my goal is to find a deal that benefits both of us. This helps keep the conversation positive and avoids appearing overly demanding.
* **Time Pressure:** I subtly imply that time is running out, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to reach a deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing Bob's Limit:** This counteroffer is a careful compromise that gauges how much further Bob is willing to go.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By refusing his previous offer and making a smaller reduction, I'm putting pressure on Bob to raise his bid.
* **Balancing Profit and Time:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, I'm getting closer to needing to consider selling to John. This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $1,600,000 is closer to my goal, it's still not within my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This is a substantial compromise that reflects the product's value and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm hopeful we can finalize this transaction with this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I need to push for a higher price, especially with only 4 rounds remaining.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer again demonstrates that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Counteroffer with a Small Reduction:** In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that is a small reduction from my previous offer, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate further but not at a drastic rate.  This shows I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Balancing Profit and Time:** With limited rounds left, I need to be decisive. Selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, but there's still a chance I can secure a better deal with Bob. I'll need to carefully assess the situation in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a good offer, it's still slightly below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a substantial compromise on my part, and it's a price that reflects the product's value while allowing us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal and make it a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Smaller Reduction:** I've reduced my offer by only $200,000, showing that I'm still committed to getting a good price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Focus on Win-Win:** I reiterate that my goal is to find a deal that benefits both of us. This helps keep the conversation positive and avoids appearing overly demanding.
* **Urgency:** I emphasize the need to finalize the deal, subtly increasing the pressure on Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is a significant compromise, but it's still within my acceptable range. I'm hoping this will be the final price point.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** Selling to John will guarantee $1,500,000, but there's still a chance to get a slightly better deal with Bob.  With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to assess the risk of continuing negotiations.
* **Readying for Decision:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully weigh the risk of walking away and selling to John, or making a final, lower counteroffer in the next round."
