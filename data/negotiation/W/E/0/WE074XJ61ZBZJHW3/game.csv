"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but  $900,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could we settle on something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $750,000? That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if we can agree on this.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
