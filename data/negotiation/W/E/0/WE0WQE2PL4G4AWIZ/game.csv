"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. This price reflects its potential and the value it can bring to your business.  Please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $1400000? I believe this might be closer to what we can agree upon.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1400000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1450000?  This would still allow you a good deal, while also giving me a fair return on my investment.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1450000 is a step in the right direction, I am still looking to keep my expenses within a certain limit. Could we possibly meet at $1425000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1425000.0,Bob,4,
