"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $9500 is a bit higher than I'd like to start.  I'd be willing to pay $7500 for the product.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $8000, which is a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land a price closer to my initial offer of $7500.  How about we split the difference and settle on $7750?  It's a fair price for both of us and we can move forward with the purchase.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8000. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to offer it to you for $7900. It's a great compromise and still a fantastic deal for you.",7900.0,Alice,5,
