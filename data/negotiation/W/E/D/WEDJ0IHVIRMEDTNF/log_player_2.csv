{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice's offer is $110.  This is a good deal but there's room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

*  Buying from John at $120 ensures you get the product and saves you the time and effort of further negotiations."
