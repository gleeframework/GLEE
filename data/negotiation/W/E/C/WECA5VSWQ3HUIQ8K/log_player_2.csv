"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

You can do better than $120.  You have room to negotiate, as you're willing to pay up to $150 and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $80.  It makes sense to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation if Alice isn't happy with it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is still within your budget and a better deal than buying from John for $150. Accepting this offer is the best option to save money."
