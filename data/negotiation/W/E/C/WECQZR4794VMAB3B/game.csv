"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob, but $100 is quite a drop from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115?",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $115 is still a bit high for me.  How about $110?  This is a reasonable price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
