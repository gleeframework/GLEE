"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think?

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is far above his maximum budget of $8,000. It's best to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $13,000 to make it worth my while. Can you consider $13,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob, but I still need to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.

```"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've gone as low as I can go, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $11,250, which is the lowest I can sell the product for and still make a profit.
