"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:**  The message is polite and highlights the value proposition for Bob.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** The price leaves enough room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling pressured. 
* **Balancing risk:** While I'm aiming high, I'm also aware of the potential of losing the deal.  The price is still attractive enough for Bob to consider.

**Next steps:**

*  I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction.
* If he rejects, I'll lower my price slightly, but not too much, in the next round. 
* If he counters, I'll consider his offer and respond accordingly. 
* I'll keep an eye on the number of rounds and the potential of selling to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It also doesn't leave enough room for further negotiations to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Opportunity to increase the price:**  I can still get a higher price from Bob, and I have rounds left to explore this option.
* **John's offer is a solid backup:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, which I can utilize if negotiations fall apart.

**Next steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my original offer, but still higher than his counteroffer. 
* I'll aim to bridge the gap gradually, keeping the potential deal with John in mind as a fallback."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This still represents a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  My counteroffer is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise and keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Highlighting value for Bob:** I'm emphasizing that even at $10,500, the product is a good deal for him. 
* **Maintaining my minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Keeping the pressure on:**  By rejecting Bob's initial offer, I've shown that I'm not desperate for a sale.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully observe Bob's reaction to my counteroffer.
*  If he accepts, the deal is closed. 
* If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate strategically, moving closer to his price with each round, while keeping the potential sale to John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9,500? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still not a financially viable option for me. 
* **""Final offer"" doesn't mean final:**  While Bob has stated this is his final offer, this is a common tactic in negotiation. There's still room to adjust the price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential of getting a better deal (closer to $15,000) outweighs the risk of losing the deal altogether.

**Next steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to his offer but still higher than my minimum acceptable price.  
* I'll emphasize the value of the product and try to find a compromise.
*  I'll keep John's offer as a safety net, but I'm still aiming to get the best possible deal from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I've lowered my price to $10,000, which is closer to Bob's offer of $9,500. 
* **Finding a middle ground:**  $10,000 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum price. 
* **Emphasizing a win-win:** I'm framing this as a fair price for both of us, to encourage a positive outcome.
* **Closing pressure:** I'm subtly emphasizing the need to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully observe Bob's reaction to my counteroffer. 
* If he accepts, the deal is closed.
* If he rejects, I'll need to assess whether to lower my price further or  consider John's offer. 
* I'm committed to negotiating further, but I'm also aware of the time constraint and the potential of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet at $9,800? That's my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my $15,000 minimum.  I'm not desperate enough to accept a price that significantly undercuts my value.
* **""Last offer"" tactic:** The ""last offer"" phrase is a common negotiation tactic. It's unlikely this is his final offer, and I can still try to push for a higher price.
* **Time is ticking:**  We're approaching the halfway point of negotiations, and selling to John is becoming more appealing. However, I want to exhaust all options with Bob first.

**Next steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his, trying to close the gap. 
* I'll be prepared to make a decision based on his response. If he rejects again, I might consider selling to John in the next round.
* I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and try to find common ground with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing your limits, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $10,200. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** I'm lowering my price from $10,500 to $10,200, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise. This is a small enough concession that it doesn't make me feel like I'm giving up too much.
* **Maintaining my minimum:** Even at $10,200, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I'm framing this as a fair compromise that will work for both of us, which is a positive and collaborative approach. 
* **Creating urgency:** I'm subtly reinforcing the importance of closing the deal with the phrase ""What do you say?"".

**Next Steps:**

* I'll assess Bob's response carefully. If he rejects, I might consider selling to John in the next round as the time constraint is becoming more of a factor.
*  If he accepts, the deal is closed, and I've secured a price that is significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.
* If he counteroffers, I'll evaluate the offer and make a decision based on how close it is to my minimum and how many rounds are left."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet at $9,900? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're in round 8, and there are only 2 rounds left.  I'm running out of time to negotiate with Bob.
* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,900 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Even with only two rounds left, it's unlikely I can get Bob to budge much further.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed win:**  John is offering me $15,000, which is my minimum.  Accepting his offer guarantees me the best possible outcome. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll decline Bob's offer and immediately sell the product to John for $15,000. This maximizes my profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
