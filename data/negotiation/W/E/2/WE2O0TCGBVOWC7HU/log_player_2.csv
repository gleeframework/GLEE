# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more. By rejecting, he can try to get Alice to come down in price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far apart from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he can get from John. There's room for further negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.
