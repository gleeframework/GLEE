{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. 

**Reasoning:**

This offer strikes a balance between maximizing my profit and maintaining the possibility of a successful negotiation. While I want to get as close to my $1,500,000 value as possible, I'm also aware that Bob might not accept a price that's too far above his own valuation. This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially move closer to my target price through counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and my minimum acceptable value.  Accepting this offer would mean leaving a substantial amount of money on the table.

**Reasoning:**

I'm not willing to settle for $1,100,000. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. There's still room for compromise, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $1,500,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a better deal, while also keeping the negotiation open. I'm willing to consider a counteroffer, but I'm not going to accept a price that's far below my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows us both to find some common ground. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,175,000:** This price is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's a significant step closer to Bob's desired price while still allowing me to make a profit that's more in line with my valuation.
* **Message:** The message is positive and reassuring, emphasizing that this offer is a good deal for both parties. It also expresses a willingness to work with Bob to find a solution that works for everyone.

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm flexible and open to finding a solution that satisfies both our needs. By offering a price that's closer to his desired value, I increase the chances that he'll accept the offer. However, this price is still above my minimum acceptable value, ensuring that I don't sell the product for too low a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price that I'm comfortable with, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on a much better offer from John.

**Reasoning:**

* **John's offer guarantees a much higher profit:** By selling to John, I secure a profit of $500,000, which is significantly more than what I would make by accepting Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation risk:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him rejecting further counteroffers or of the negotiation dragging on for an extended period, potentially losing me both time and money.
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John eliminates these risks and guarantees a profitable outcome.

While I would prefer to sell the product for closer to my desired price, the potential upside of selling to John outweighs the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
