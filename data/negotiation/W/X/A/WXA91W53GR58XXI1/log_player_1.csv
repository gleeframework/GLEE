Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, but it's also important to remain within a realistic range that Bob might consider."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $850,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still going to reject this offer. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle yet.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is now offering my minimum price, but I've already spent several rounds negotiating. I'm running out of time and there's no guarantee Bob will budge further. It's time to cut my losses and accept the offer from John, which guarantees me $800,000."
