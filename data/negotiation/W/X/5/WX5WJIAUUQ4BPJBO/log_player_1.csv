"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm open to offers, but I know it's worth at least $150 to me.  What do you think is a fair price?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $200, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this right away. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and open tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I mention the product's value to me, subtly hinting at its potential worth to Bob.
* **Open to Offers:**  I'm stating that I'm open to offers, further encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $200 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $160 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $160 is closer to my minimum price of $150, but there's still room to improve.
* **Seeking a Better Deal:** I believe I can get a higher price, especially since I have 8 more rounds to negotiate.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting his offer will allow me to counter with a higher price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also my understanding of the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $175 is the lowest I can go right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm counteroffering with a price of $175, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm justifying the price by stating that it's the ""lowest I can go right now,"" which implies that I'm still holding out for a better deal.
* **Encouraging Negotiation:**  I'm using an encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward and open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $175 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $165 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $165 is only $5 below my minimum price of $160.  
* **Limited Rounds:** We are already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing a sale with only 6 rounds left. 
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:** Even if I reject this offer, there's no guarantee Bob will come up to my desired price. 

While I'd like to get closer to $175, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, with less risk of losing the deal."
