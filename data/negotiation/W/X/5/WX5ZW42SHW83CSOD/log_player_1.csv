Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a price that works for both of us."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Bob's offer of $950,000 is still too low for me, and I'm not sure we'll be able to reach a price that works for both of us.  John is a guaranteed buyer at a price that I'm comfortable with, so I'm going to take that deal."
