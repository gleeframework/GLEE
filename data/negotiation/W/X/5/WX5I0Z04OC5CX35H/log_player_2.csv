"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking for a price that's a bit higher than what you're probably expecting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget, and even above its worth to her. It makes the most sense to buy from John for $80."
