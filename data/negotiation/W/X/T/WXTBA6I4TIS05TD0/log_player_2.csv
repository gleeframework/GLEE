"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but there's potential to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a move in the right direction, but it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can justify.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to be closer to the value of the product. I'll counteroffer at $1,025,000. This should be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been consistently aiming for a price closer to $900,000, but Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is starting to get close to his maximum acceptable range.  Since they only have 5 rounds left, continuing to reject and counteroffer might lead to a stalemate.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's still significantly lower than what John would charge."
