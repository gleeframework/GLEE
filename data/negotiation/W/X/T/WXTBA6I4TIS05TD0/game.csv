"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can justify.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to be closer to the value of the product. I'll counteroffer at $1,025,000. This should be a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
