You have three options:

You are trying to save as much money as possible. $115 is too high for you. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110,  what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

You are trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is still more than you would like to pay, it is a good deal compared to buying from John for $120."
