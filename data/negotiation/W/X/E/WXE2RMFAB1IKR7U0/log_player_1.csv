Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I believe I can find something similar elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

Since Bob's offer is your minimum price and you have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to John makes the most sense. There's no upside to further negotiation as Bob is unlikely to offer more."
