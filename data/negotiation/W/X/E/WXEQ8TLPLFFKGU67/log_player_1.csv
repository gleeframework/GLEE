Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above the product's value to me. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my offer, emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm making it clear I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

This strategy aims to get the best price while remaining open to a fair deal. If Bob rejects my offer, I can then consider his counteroffer or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me ($1,000,000).  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range, or to move on to John if Bob isn't willing to negotiate fairly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  This product is unique and its value is well-established.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which is still a fair price considering its market value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reason:**  I'm not just arbitrarily rejecting Bob's offer. I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the product's uniqueness and value. 
* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my bottom line. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive and open to a deal.

This counteroffer strikes a balance between firmness and flexibility, aiming to steer the negotiation towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $925,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum threshold.  Considering that:

* I'm already in a negotiation with Bob, and further negotiation might not lead to a higher offer.
* Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, but it involves ending the negotiation with Bob.
* Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and get closer to my target price.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer at $925,000 seems like the most sensible option at this point.  It allows me to close the deal without jeopardizing the opportunity for a higher price in the future."
