Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I do have another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 gives Alice leverage. Starting high (significantly above Bob's value) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for maximum profit. 
* **Scarcity tactic:**  Mentioning another buyer (""John"") creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to accept a higher price.
* **Guaranteed alternative:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she'll get her minimum desired price ($1,000,000).

**Important:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. If multiple rounds were possible, a different approach involving more back-and-forth might be more suitable."
