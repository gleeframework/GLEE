"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still reflects the value of the product for you, and it allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,5,
