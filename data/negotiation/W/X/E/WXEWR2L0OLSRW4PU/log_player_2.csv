"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice is trying to convince Bob that it's a good deal,  $900,000 is still more than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Since Bob can get the same product from John for $800,000, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer."
