"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true value and the significant returns you'll see.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I acknowledge the product's potential, $2,000,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues this product and its future potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, but that's my absolute floor. Frankly, I have another interested buyer who sees the full value, but I believe in giving you the first opportunity.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair reflection of the value I see in the product.  This represents a compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate the increased offer, and it's clear you recognize the value here. To be transparent, the other interested party is ready to move forward at my asking price. However, I'd prefer to do business with you.  Let's settle this: $1,600,000, and we have a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,600,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  I believe this is a final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
