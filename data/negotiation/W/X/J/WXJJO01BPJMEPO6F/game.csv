"I think the product is worth a good price, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for it. Can you consider that?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product is worth a lot to me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would you consider $100?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $70 for the product. Can you consider that?",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $80 for it to be worthwhile. That's my final offer.",80.0,Alice,5,
