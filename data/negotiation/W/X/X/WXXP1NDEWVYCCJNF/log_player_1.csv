Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 (our minimum acceptable price) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Beat John's Offer:**  Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it for $14,000 is still a better deal than John's offer of $15,000 (which we'll take if Bob refuses).

This strategy aims to secure a sale with Bob while maximizing our potential profit."
