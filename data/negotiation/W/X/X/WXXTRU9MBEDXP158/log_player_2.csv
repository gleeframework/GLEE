"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than John's price of $1,200,000, there's room for negotiation. Alice values the product at $800,000, meaning there's a potential to get a better deal. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt Alice to propose a lower price closer to her valuation."
