"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset for you. I've assessed its potential worth to you and am confident it would generate significant returns. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,000,000. This represents a considerable savings for you and allows me to receive a fair return on my investment. Please consider this offer carefully, as it's a chance to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. If you decline, I will be selling it to another buyer for $800,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
