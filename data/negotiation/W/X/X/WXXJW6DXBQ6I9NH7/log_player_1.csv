"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a decent profit for me.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging, mentioning the product's value to Bob. This helps build rapport and increases the chance of Bob accepting the offer.

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to maximize my profit while also considering the time constraint.  Starting with a slightly higher price allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a better price in subsequent rounds.  However, if negotiations stall or Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable, I have the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.  

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I'm still prepared to sell to John if necessary, but I want to see if I can secure a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This still allows me a fair profit, and it's a price I believe is reasonable considering the value this product offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still ensuring a decent profit.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and stating my rationale for the counteroffer.  I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground and move the negotiation closer to my desired price.  By offering $110, I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong bargaining position. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I'm still keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John if necessary, but I believe there's still room for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $105. This is a fair price considering the value this product offers, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, further demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to meet in the middle. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire to find a compromise and emphasizing the value of the product to justify my counteroffer. I'm aiming for a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

By offering $105, I'm hoping to reach a compromise with Bob while still securing a decent profit for myself.  I'm also keeping in mind the time constraint, as we're now halfway through the negotiation rounds. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully evaluate his next counteroffer and consider selling to John if the price remains too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit short on budget, so I'd be willing to pay $98 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous ones, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to accept such a low price, especially with the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $150.

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'm still keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John if necessary, but I believe there's still room for a better deal with Bob.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, so I'll need to be more decisive in my next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still trying to find a price that works for you.  Given our limited time, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll offer the product for $100. This is my best price, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Counter Offer:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's latest offer but still allows me a decent profit.  I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints and offering a compromise. I'm also highlighting the time pressure to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to reach a compromise with Bob while also ensuring a decent profit.  I'm acknowledging the time constraint and emphasizing the value of the product to persuade Bob to accept the offer.  However, if Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John, as we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $95 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price.  

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to sell to John for $150. This guarantees me my desired profit and avoids the risk of ending up with a much lower price if I continue negotiating with Bob.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I can't risk losing out on a much better deal with John."
