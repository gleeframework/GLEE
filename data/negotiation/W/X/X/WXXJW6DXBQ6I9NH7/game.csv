"I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This still allows me a fair profit, and it's a price I believe is reasonable considering the value this product offers. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me in the middle?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $105. This is a fair price considering the value this product offers, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're still trying to find a price that works for you.  Given our limited time, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll offer the product for $100. This is my best price, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal.",100.0,Alice,7,
