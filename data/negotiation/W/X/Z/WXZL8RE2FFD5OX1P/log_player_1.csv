This is my initial offer to Bob. It's a high price, reflecting the value of the product to me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in it, but I'm also prepared to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and then decide whether to accept or counter. I'm confident I can get a price higher than $1,200,000, but I'm ready to sell to John if necessary."
