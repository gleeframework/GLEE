"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your position, but $9,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident you'll find that a fair price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000. I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
