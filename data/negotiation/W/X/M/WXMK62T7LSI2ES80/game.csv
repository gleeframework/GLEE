"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't justify paying $20,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? ",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite high for me. How about we settle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $16,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,
