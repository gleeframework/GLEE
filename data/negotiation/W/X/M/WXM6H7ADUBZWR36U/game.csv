"Alice, your offer is above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective. While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product extends significantly beyond $1,200,000.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
