Round 2

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I think I made a mistake earlier. Since Alice's offer is $100, which is the same price I can get from John, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that, but not by much.
