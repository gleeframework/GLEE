"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $9,500 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price ($10,000) as possible. 
* Starting with a high offer allows me to have room to negotiate down if needed.
* By being friendly and emphasizing the value to Bob, I hope to build a positive rapport and increase the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept such a low price yet.  

**Strategy:**

* I'm going to counter-offer with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle.
* I'm confident I can get a better deal than $8,500.
*  Selling to John right now guarantees me my minimum price, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to $10,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a price in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my minimum.
* **Message:**  I'm staying positive and reiterating the value of the product for Bob. The ""great deal"" phrasing encourages him to see the offer as a good opportunity.

**Strategy:**

* I'm confident that Bob will accept this counteroffer, as it's a reasonable compromise.
*  It gives me a good chance of getting a price closer to my minimum without going through too many more rounds.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely offer him my minimum ($10,000) in the next round and then move to sell to John if he rejects that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. How about we try $8,200? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low for me to accept. I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can get a better deal.

**Strategy:**

* I'm going to counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to get closer to my desired price. 
* I'm aware that I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, so I need to be strategic in my counteroffer. 
* If Bob rejects my next offer, I'll be prepared to sell to John and ensure my minimum profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,200 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,700. That's a significant compromise on my end, and it's the best I can do.  Think about it â€“ you're getting a great product for a price that's still well below its actual value.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8700}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still below my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility while remaining firm on my price.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the ""great deal"" Bob is getting at this price. I'm also creating a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is my best offer.

**Strategy:**

* This is a risky move.  If Bob rejects, I'm only one round away from having to sell to John. 
* However, I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this offer and accept. 
* If he doesn't, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $10,000, securing my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $8,400? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is only $300 less than my counteroffer, it's still not enough for me to accept. We're getting close to a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

* I'm going to make one final counteroffer to Bob, trying to get him to agree to a price closer to $9,000.
* I know that if he rejects my next offer, I will be forced to sell to John, but I want to see if I can get a better price first. 
* I'm hoping that Bob will realize he's close to a deal and will be willing to compromise."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting really close here.  How about we compromise at $8,600? That's only $200 more than your offer, and it's still a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal and get this product to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8600}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that's only $200 higher than Bob's offer, making it a very small difference. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and shows that I'm trying to reach an agreement.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the closeness of the deal and highlighting that it's still a good price for Bob. I'm also using a friendly tone to encourage him to accept. 

**Strategy:**

* This is my last chance to get a better price before I have to sell to John. 
* By making a small counteroffer, I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that we're close to a deal and be willing to accept.
* If he rejects, I'll sell to John and ensure my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away from this deal, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $8,400, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from someone else. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer is still lower than what I'm comfortable with, and I'm running out of time.  It's not worth risking another round of negotiation, especially with Bob's threat to walk away.  I'm confident I can get my minimum price of $10,000 from John.

**Strategy:**

*  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit.
* While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, the risk of him walking away and the pressure of the limited rounds make selling to John the safer choice."
