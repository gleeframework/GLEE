"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. How about we try $8,200? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,200 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,700. That's a significant compromise on my end, and it's the best I can do.  Think about it â€“ you're getting a great product for a price that's still well below its actual value.  Let's close this deal.",8700.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $8,400? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",8400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting really close here.  How about we compromise at $8,600? That's only $200 more than your offer, and it's still a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal and get this product to you.  What do you say?",8600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away from this deal, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $8,400, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",8400.0,Bob,8,
