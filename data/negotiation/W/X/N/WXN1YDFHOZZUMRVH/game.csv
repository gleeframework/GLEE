"I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11000. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's worth it to me. How about we meet at $9500? I'm willing to compromise and make a serious offer, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10500. It's a fair price that should meet your budget and still allow me to get a good return on my investment.",10500.0,Alice,5,
