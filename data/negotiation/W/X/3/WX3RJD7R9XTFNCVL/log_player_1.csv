Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting.  

Here's why:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $9,500 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, meaning you'll still earn a decent profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** $9,500 is lower than the $10,000 value Bob places on the product, giving him a potential benefit if he buys.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters with a lower offer, you have room to negotiate while still making more than you would from John."
