"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired maximum of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still represents a decent profit for Alice.  It's also a reasonable price for Bob, giving him some wiggle room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $10,500 is still above Bob's desired maximum of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice may be willing to come down further, especially as the rounds progress and the possibility of Bob buying from John becomes more real."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $9,500.  I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to compromise while still holding firm to his budget. It's a small increase from Bob's previous offer, suggesting he's willing to pay more if Alice is willing to negotiate further. It also places pressure on Alice, knowing she could lose the deal to John if she doesn't meet Bob's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good offer and closer to Bob's target, it still exceeds his maximum budget of $8,000.  There's a good chance Alice will continue to negotiate, especially as the rounds progress and the threat of Bob buying from John becomes more substantial.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to continue trying for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but I need to stick to my budget.  $9,750 is the absolute highest I can go right now.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his limit, but there's still room for negotiation.  This counteroffer is a small increase from his previous offer, showing willingness to compromise. It also brings the price closer to Alice's last offer, suggesting that a deal is possible.  Alice might be swayed by the fact that Bob is nearing his budget and may not go higher."
