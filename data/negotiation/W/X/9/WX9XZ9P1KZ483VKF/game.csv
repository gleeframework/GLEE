"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $6,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $8,200?",8200.0,Alice,5,
