"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $15,000 by you. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects its true value while ensuring you receive a great deal. Would you be open to discussing a price that lies between $14,000 and $15,000? I'm eager to find a solution that works well for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still quite close to your maximum budget. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a significantly lower price. There's a chance she'll come back with a better offer closer to her own valuation of $12,000. Even if she doesn't budge much, you still have the option to buy from John for $15,000."
