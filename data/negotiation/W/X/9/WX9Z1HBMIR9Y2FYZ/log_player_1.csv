Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's more than what Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's $15,000 offer, but I'm also willing to walk away if Bob is unwilling to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping to get for the product. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, but I'm also demonstrating a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my bottom line, but it's still not enough.  I'm confident that I can get a better price by selling to John.  John is guaranteed to pay $15,000, which is significantly more than Bob's final offer. It's time to move on and secure the best deal."
