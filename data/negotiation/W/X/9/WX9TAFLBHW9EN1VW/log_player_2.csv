"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a valuable product that could be a game changer for your business. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm asking for $1,000,000, which is still below its true value to you.  This is a win-win opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than John's price, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of $800,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, Bob signals that he's looking for a better deal, which could lead Alice to propose a lower price closer to her valuation."
