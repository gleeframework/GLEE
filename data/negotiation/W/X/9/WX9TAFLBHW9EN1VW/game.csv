"Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a valuable product that could be a game changer for your business. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm asking for $1,000,000, which is still below its true value to you.  This is a win-win opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
