Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I can see you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for. What do you think?
