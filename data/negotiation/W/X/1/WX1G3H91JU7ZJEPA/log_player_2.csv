"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's initial offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This aggressive approach puts pressure on Alice to negotiate seriously.  While this price might be too low for Alice to accept immediately, it establishes Bob's willingness to bargain and sets a lower price anchor for subsequent negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his preferred target.  Continuing to negotiate allows Bob to potentially secure an even lower price.  There are still several rounds remaining, and rejecting the offer maintains the pressure on Alice to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is $12,000. This continues to put pressure on Alice while still being a reasonable offer given the previous rounds. Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, but he is also holding firm on his desire to get a good deal. The counteroffer is strategically placed to incentivize Alice to accept."
