Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, I can likely get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."

Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

While $1,375,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident that I can secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm happy to accept $1,462,500. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1462500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still within striking distance of my goal. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal at a more favorable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price.  $1,400,000 is still a bit short of where I need to be.  I'm prepared to make one final concession, but I need to be at $1,450,000 to make this deal work. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can move forward with this sale.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my goal, but I'm only two rounds away from having to sell to John for $1,500,000.  Given the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob and the certainty of a sale to John, I'm going to sell to John now."
