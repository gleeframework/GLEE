"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. I would be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair price considering my financial limitations.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  I could consider a price of $975,000. This offer takes into account the value it offers but still provides a substantial discount.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $975,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This would be my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
