Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","While Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, it's still significantly more than my minimum. I'll counter to see if we can meet closer to the middle.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000 and get this done.

Bob is clearly very interested and meeting in the middle at $1,100,000 is a substantial profit above my minimum. It's better to take this sure thing than risk him walking away in the next round."
