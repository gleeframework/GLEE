"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $1,150,000 reflects its worth fairly. This offer stands for 24 hours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is under your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of her coming back with a lower price, especially since she's given a 24-hour deadline. If she doesn't budge, you still have John as a backup option."
