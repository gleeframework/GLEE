Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information you provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $1,150,000 reflects its worth fairly. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly lower than Bob's maximum allows for some back-and-forth if Bob wants to negotiate.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a time limit creates a sense of urgency and may encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net (John) willing to pay your minimum, so you're not desperate. This lets you confidently aim high with Bob."
