"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it can bring you a significant return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. How about we try $875,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
