Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is strategically placed:
    * It's significantly above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving you room to negotiate if needed.
    * It's still attractive enough that Bob might be willing to pay a premium to secure the product, especially if you emphasize its scarcity and value.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning other buyers and framing it as a limited-time offer, you create a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to act quickly."
