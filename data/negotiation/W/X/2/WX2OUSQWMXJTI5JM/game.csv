"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $15000 right now. Would you be willing to consider that?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $15000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. After reviewing the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $17500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this under $16000. Would you be open to coming down just a bit more?",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $18000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can sell the product to you for $17250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",17250.0,Alice,5,
