Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it!  I'm offering it to you for $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me ($80) and to Bob ($80). This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage a good negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80, so I will reject his offer. I believe I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I can't go as low as $70, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $75?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was really hoping to get it for a bit lower. How about $72? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  Bob's offer of $72 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  It's a good compromise and allows me to close the deal without risking losing the sale to John."
