"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find very appealing. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no need to pay $11,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or stick with John's offer as your backup."
