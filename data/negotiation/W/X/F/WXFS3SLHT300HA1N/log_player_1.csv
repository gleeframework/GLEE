``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate if necessary.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic, hoping to encourage a positive response.  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, but I'm also prepared to move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,500? I believe this would still provide a good return for you while allowing me to purchase the item at a price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a better price. Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, so I will reject it and counter with a new offer.  I believe I can still get a price closer to my desired $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $9,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $9,000.  This is still above his initial offer, but it demonstrates a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose an offer of $8,800 for the product. This allows us both to reach a fair compromise without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still below my minimum of $10,000, it's a better deal than selling to John for $10,000.  It's also close enough to my last counteroffer that it seems likely that further negotiation will only be drawn out and could risk losing the deal altogether.  Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $8,800."
