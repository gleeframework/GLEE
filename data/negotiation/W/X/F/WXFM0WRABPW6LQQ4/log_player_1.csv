Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He'll accept any offer below this price and potentially even slightly above if he sees it as a good deal. 
* **The Sweet Spot:** Your goal is to find a price that maximizes your profit while still being attractive to Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll be impressed with what it can do. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Rationale**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message starts by emphasizing the product's value to Bob, framing it positively.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,350,000 is:
    * Significantly below Bob's perceived value, making it appealing.
    * Well above your minimum acceptable price, ensuring a healthy profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is collaborative rather than demanding, inviting Bob to counter-offer if he wishes.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. You may need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he immediately rejects this offer, it might suggest he's hoping for a price closer to his own valuation. You'll have to decide how much you're willing to negotiate before accepting John's guaranteed offer."
