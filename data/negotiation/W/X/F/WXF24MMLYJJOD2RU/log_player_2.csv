It's always worth exploring options and seeing if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive counteroffer.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down in price, but I'm still not convinced that $700,000 is a good deal. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 675000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $675,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a better price than her last offer.  This counteroffer is closer to her last offer, but I believe there's still room for us to meet in the middle."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice is still above my ideal price, and I have time to negotiate further. I'm going to try to get her to meet me in the middle."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm going to meet Alice halfway on her last offer, proposing $700,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  It also puts the ball back in her court to see if she's willing to close the deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has gone back up to her original price, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal. There are still rounds left, and I don't want to rush into a deal that's not advantageous to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

I'm going to meet Alice halfway again, offering $725,000. It's a compromise from both of our previous offers, and I hope it will be enough to convince her to sell. We are running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk having to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still above my ideal price, and we are down to the last round. It's better to buy from John at $800,000 than to risk Alice rejecting my final counteroffer.  It's not my preferred outcome, but I don't want to risk not getting the product at all."
