"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  You have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $8,000.  This is a bold move, but it establishes my absolute limit and forces Alice to decide if she's willing to accept a significant discount. If she rejects, we can see how far she's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still outside my budget.  I have a few rounds left, and I can still negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $8,000 to $9,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but still within my budget.  This is a middle ground that might entice her to accept, especially since we are nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now halfway through the negotiation rounds, and Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. While there is potential for further negotiation, it's becoming riskier to continue with Alice.  If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and I may end up with no deal at all.  

By purchasing from John, I guarantee myself the product at a price within my budget, ensuring a successful outcome."
