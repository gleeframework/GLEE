"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down a bit on the price?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go down to $8,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $10,000.  Would you consider $9,200?",9200.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your target price, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,200. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,
