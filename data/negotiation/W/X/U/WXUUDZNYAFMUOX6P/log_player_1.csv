Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $950,000, which is closer to my ideal price of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm framing the offer by emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him see it as a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching Bob's response closely. If he rejects my offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'll also be prepared to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm offering you $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential gain. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation of $800,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target.  
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product. I have a guaranteed alternative with John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $950,000. I'll emphasize the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. I'll also keep in mind the option of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob continue to be unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $900,000? This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $900,000 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above his initial valuation.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value and suggesting that $900,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Compromise Language:** I use phrases like ""come down a bit further"" and ""fair compromise"" to show I'm willing to negotiate but still stand my ground.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be closely monitoring Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, I'll need to carefully evaluate my options. I can offer a final counteroffer or explore selling to John, depending on the situation and Bob's negotiating stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:**  Bob's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still significantly below my ideal price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a stalemate.  His last offer shows he's unwilling to budge significantly. 
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000. This offers a much better return than accepting Bob's current offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll politely decline Bob's offer and inform him that I've found another buyer who is willing to pay my asking price. I'll thank him for his time and wish him well."
