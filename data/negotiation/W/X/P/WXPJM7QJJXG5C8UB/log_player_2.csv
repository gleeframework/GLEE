"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. Here's my initial offer: I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

You're aiming to save as much as possible, so it's best to reject Alice's first offer and try to get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can get the product for $80 from John.  It's a better deal and saves you $5."
