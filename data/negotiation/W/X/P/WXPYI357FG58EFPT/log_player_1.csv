Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly less than your minimum acceptable price:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers.
* **It's a reasonable price for Bob:** While still leaving some profit for you, it's also enticing for Bob as it's below his perceived value of the product.
* **It signals your willingness to negotiate:** By making a first offer, you show that you're open to finding a mutually beneficial price. 

Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price than his initial rejection, it's still significantly less than your ideal outcome. You have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a better deal, so rejecting his offer is the most strategic move at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between your and Bob's desired price points:

* **It's a significant concession:** It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's a reasonable compromise:**  It offers Bob a discount compared to your initial offer while still providing you with a decent profit.
* **It invites further discussion:** By posing a question, you encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering my budget and the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's not ideal, it's a good deal considering your other option is to sell to John for $1,500,000.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a significant profit."
