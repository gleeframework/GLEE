Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value *to you*, the message hints at it by mentioning ""given its value."" This subtly implies there's a reason behind the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open and invites Bob to share his thoughts, indicating a willingness to negotiate.

By setting the initial offer at $15,000, Alice aims to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can always negotiate down, knowing she has John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $12,000."
