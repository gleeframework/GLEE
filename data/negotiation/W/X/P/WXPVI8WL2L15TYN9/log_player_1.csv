"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $7,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $7,000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not ready to sell for $7,750 yet.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $8,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $7,750 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $8,250?

Round 6
