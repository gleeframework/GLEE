Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My Minimum:** I need at least $800,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Space:** This gives us a negotiation space of $700,000 ($1,500,000 - $800,000).
* **Compromise:**  Offering $1,200,000 allows me to earn significantly more than my minimum while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.

By offering a price in the middle of the negotiation space, I increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer, while still ensuring a profitable sale for myself."
