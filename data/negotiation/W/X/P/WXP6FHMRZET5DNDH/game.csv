"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $120 to $105, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $95 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference - how about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and it saves us both from going back and forth anymore.",100.0,Alice,5,
