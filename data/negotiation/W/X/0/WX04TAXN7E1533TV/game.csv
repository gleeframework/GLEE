"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, $1000000 is still above my initial budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its worth to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to sell the product for $950000. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product to you and my desired profit margin.",950000.0,Alice,3,
