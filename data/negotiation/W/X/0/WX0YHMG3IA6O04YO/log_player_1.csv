Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest and encourage a counter-offer.  
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's no risk of losing money by aiming higher with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's worth to Bob, he might not be willing to pay his maximum. Consider factors like his budget and urgency.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your offer. You might need to compromise to reach a deal."
