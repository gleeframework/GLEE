Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It also signals to Bob that the product is valuable and I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm countering with $9,750. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility but still leaving room for further negotiation. I believe this price is fair and likely to be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although $9,400 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still achieve a better price. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9550}
```

I'm countering with $9,550. This is a further compromise, but it still allows me to get a price that is higher than John's offer of $8,000. I believe this is a fair price that Bob might be willing to accept, as it's only $50 more than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $8,000.  Bob's offers have been consistently below my minimum, and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate will only result in further reductions.  At this point, it's best to accept John's offer and guarantee a sale."
