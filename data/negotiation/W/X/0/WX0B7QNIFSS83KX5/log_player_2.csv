"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than her perceived value of the product ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000). As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer makes sense. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to negotiate down, and even if she doesn't, I still have 9 rounds left to reach a mutually acceptable price or explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a fair starting point, considering the product's value to Alice is $800,000. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a substantial savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price from her initial offer, $1,100,000 is still a significant amount above her perceived value. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring if we can reach a lower price.  We have multiple rounds left to reach a mutually acceptable price, so continuing to negotiate with Alice is the best option.  Rejecting her offer now keeps the option of a better deal on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by reducing her price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000.  My counteroffer of $950,000 is a compromise, meeting her halfway from my previous offer of $900,000. This strategy demonstrates a commitment to negotiation while still aiming for a price closer to her perceived value. It increases the likelihood of Alice accepting the offer and reaching a deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and her current offer of $1,050,000 is within a reasonable range of my desired price. While I'd prefer to pay closer to $950,000, accepting her offer ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further rounds of negotiation.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further or potentially even increasing her price.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and allows me to move on."
