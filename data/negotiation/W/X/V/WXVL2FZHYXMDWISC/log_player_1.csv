Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he would theoretically be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to earn at least $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases the chances of him accepting while securing a substantial profit for you. 
* **The Offer:** $1,350,000 leaves a good margin for Bob ($150,000) and earns you $350,000 more than selling to John. 

This strategy balances risk and reward by offering Bob a good deal while still pushing for a higher profit margin."
