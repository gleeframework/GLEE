Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer allows me to make a profit of $2,000, which is better than selling to John immediately. It also gives Bob some room to negotiate, which might lead to a faster and smoother deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, I can still do better. I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $9,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I don't want to go too far above my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price,  $9,250 is a decent compromise and I'm still making a profit.  It's better to secure the deal than to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale to Bob or have to sell to John for a lower profit."
