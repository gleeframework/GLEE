"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. This encourages him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the initial price as ""fair"" to create a sense of goodwill. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The price of $1,800,000 allows for potential counteroffers without going below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is better than my minimum of $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a higher price, and with 8 rounds left, I have time to see if I can get closer to my initial ask."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Position:** I recognize Bob's desire for a good deal to build rapport and show I'm willing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied.  With six rounds left, I have enough time to try and get a better offer. While $1,500,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can push for $1,600,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $1,500,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to reflect the value of the product.

```

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1520000 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only four rounds left, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer is increasing. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,520,000 is very close to my desired range. It's better to accept this offer than risk getting a lower price from Bob or having to sell to John for the minimum $1,200,000."
