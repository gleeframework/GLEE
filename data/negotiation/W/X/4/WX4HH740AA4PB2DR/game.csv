"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm open to negotiation, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to sell the product without losing too much.",100.0,Alice,5,
