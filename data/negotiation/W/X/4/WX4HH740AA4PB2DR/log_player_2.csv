"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be perfect for you! My initial price is $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much wiggle room Alice might have.  This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below my $100 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price that beats John's offer. Let's keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

We're getting closer!  This offer splits the difference between her last offer and my previous one. It keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price below my alternative with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm open to negotiation, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to sell the product without losing too much. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our bottom line. There's no point in rejecting and risking her raising the price again, or in going with John since they offer the same price now."
