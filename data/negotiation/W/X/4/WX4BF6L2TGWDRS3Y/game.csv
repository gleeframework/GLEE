"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is tempting, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the potential returns.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's close this gap - how about $780,000?  That's a significant concession on my end, showing how eager I am to work with you.",780000.0,Alice,7,
