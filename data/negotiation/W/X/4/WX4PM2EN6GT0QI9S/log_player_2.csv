"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better deal than $15,000, Bob can potentially get the product for even cheaper.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to negotiate a price closer to his maximum budget of $10,000. By offering $10,500, he's demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still being within the range where Alice might find it worthwhile to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $10,500 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has two options:

* **Accept Alice's offer:** This means paying $11,500, which is still above his ideal price of $10,000. 
* **Reject Alice's offer and counteroffer again:** This risks further negotiation and potentially a higher final price.

Given that Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, it's the most financially sound decision to go with John.  He saves $1,500 compared to accepting Alice's offer, and eliminates the risk of the price going up further during negotiations."
