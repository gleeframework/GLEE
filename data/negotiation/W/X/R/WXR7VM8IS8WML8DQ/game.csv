"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1500000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its true value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to pay $1050000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a decent profit. What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
