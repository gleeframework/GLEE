Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm still not ready to give up on getting a better deal.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is only willing to drop to $1,080,000, which is pretty close to your last offer of $1,050,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance that Alice will stick to her offer.  Accepting Alice's offer at $1,080,000 is the best option to save money compared to buying from John for $1,500,000."
