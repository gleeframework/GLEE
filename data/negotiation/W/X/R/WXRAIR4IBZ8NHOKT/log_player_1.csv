""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that makes sense for both of us.  How does $1,300,000 sound?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 sets a strong initial point. This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, Alice gives herself the flexibility to negotiate downwards if needed. This allows her to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a price closer to his upper limit. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) for $1,500,000,  so she's not desperate. This allows her to be more assertive in her pricing strategy with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has some time to negotiate with Bob. If she needs to sell the product immediately, she may need to offer a lower price to ensure a quick sale."
