"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $9,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I believe this price still represents a good value for you, and it gives me a chance to close the deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for your product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,000. It's getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of what I need. To make this work for me, I'd need to be at $11,000. This would be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence. I am willing to consider $10,750 for your product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  $10,750 is definitely getting closer to where I need to be.  To make this work, I need just a bit more.  How about we settle on $11,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to finalize this sale.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11250.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, we're so close!  I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to make one last concession.  Let's split the difference at $11,500.  This is a fair deal for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. It's now or never, Bob.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,9,
