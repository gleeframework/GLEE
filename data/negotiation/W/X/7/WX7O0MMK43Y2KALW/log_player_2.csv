Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $16,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm not able to go higher than $10,000.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to finalize the purchase. "", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $12,500 is still above my budget. I can offer you $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $11000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a discount of $500 off the original price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but I'm running out of time. If I continue to negotiate, I risk losing the product altogether. It's more prudent to secure the product from John at $8,000 and avoid any further risk."
