# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We're excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $900,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a profit. "", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This price still reflects the value we believe the product brings to your business, and we're confident you'll see the benefits of investing in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum limit.  There's still time to negotiate a lower price, and it's worth trying to get closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to finalize the deal at $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. We're willing to make one more concession to reach an agreement. We're willing to sell the product to you for $815,000. This is as low as we can go, and we believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've negotiated as much as you can with Alice.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $800,000.  While Alice's offer is close, it's still above your budget limit, and there are no guarantees she'll come down further in the remaining rounds.  It's safer to lock in the $800,000 price with John."
