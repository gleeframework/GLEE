"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'll see if he bites. If not, I can adjust my strategy in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy with $8,000, I think I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it might be enough to convince Bob to close the deal.  If not, I'll have to reassess my strategy and potentially lower the price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Even though it's close to my minimum, I still have 6 more rounds. I believe I can either get Bob to come up a bit more, or I can sell to John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway at $8,500. This is still above my minimum, and I believe it's a fair offer. If Bob rejects again, I'll have to start seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob seems unwilling to budge much further. While I could continue negotiating,  I'm only 4 rounds away from the deal expiring, and John is a guaranteed sale at $8,000.  I'll take the sure thing."
