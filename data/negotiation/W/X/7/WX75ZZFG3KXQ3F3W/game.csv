"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $120 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $170? That's a pretty significant discount from my original asking price.",170.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $170 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $170, so how about $145?",145.0,Bob,4,
