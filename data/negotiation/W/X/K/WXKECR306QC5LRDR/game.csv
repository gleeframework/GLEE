"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly useful for you and I'm confident it's worth a significant amount.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $16,000.  What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $16,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to its true worth would be fairer. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $12,000?  It's a fair price considering the value you've outlined, and it fits within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
