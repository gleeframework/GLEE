"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,750 is still a little bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could you do $7,500?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we both see the value in this product.  I'm willing to come down to $8,250, my final offer.  This is a great deal for something that will benefit you so much."", ""product_price"": 8250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we've both invested time in this negotiation.  While $8,250 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,750. Do you think that's feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting Bob's current offer would mean losing out on potential profit, and continuing the negotiation has a risk of ending up with an even lower final offer.  It's more profitable to take John's guaranteed offer of $8,000 at this point."
