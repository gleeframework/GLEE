Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree the product is valuable, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. To meet you closer to the middle, I could consider $1,075,000."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point we can both agree on.  While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept anything below $1 million yet. I'll use the next counteroffer to signal I'm getting closer to my limit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000, but I need to be firm on that. This offer reflects the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this negotiation has been productive, and I see we are close to a deal. To show you I'm serious, I can offer $980,000. I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close, but I'm aiming to get as close to $1 million as possible.  There's still room to negotiate before accepting his offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen â€“ my final offer is $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a strong tactic for a few reasons:

* **Firm Stance:** It signals to Bob that this is the absolute bottom line.
* **Justification:** By saying it's the final offer, it creates a sense of urgency and importance. 
* **Meeting Bob's Needs:** It still allows Bob to acquire the product for less than its value to him. 

This approach gives Bob a chance to accept a price very favorable to him while maximizing your potential profit. If he rejects this offer, it's time to move on to John."
