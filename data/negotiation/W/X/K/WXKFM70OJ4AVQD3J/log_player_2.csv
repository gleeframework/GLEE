"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than John's $100, Bob can aim for a better price.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his personal value of $80 as possible without risking losing the deal.  Offering $85 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's desired price, there is still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get the price lower by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still looking for a better deal. How about $88?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to close the gap between his desired price and Alice's offer. Offering $88 shows he's willing to compromise while still trying to secure a better deal. This also positions him to potentially split the difference with Alice in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about $89?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $89, which is very close to Bob's desired price of $80.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of reaching an impasse or having to buy from John for $100 is high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price and avoids further negotiations."
