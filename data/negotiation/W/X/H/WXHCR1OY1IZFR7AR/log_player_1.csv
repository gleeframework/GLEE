"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  If he rejects, I can adjust the price down in subsequent rounds.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I need to be strategic, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer this early in the negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price that's closer to my initial offer. I'm confident that I can find a middle ground with Bob and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to undervalue the product. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more enticing to Bob, as it's a reasonable midpoint between our two previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject it again and continue negotiating. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but I'm trying to meet Bob halfway. He's clearly not willing to go much higher, and I want to keep the negotiation moving forward. I'm still hopeful that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally getting close to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm still not satisfied with it. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price that's only slightly lower than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm countering with $1,450,000. This is just a small step down from my minimum acceptable price, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he doesn't."
