,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the information about the product. However, $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be interested in purchasing it for $10000, which is my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at 11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $10500?  I'm very interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 10500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at 10800? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm really keen on acquiring this product, but $10800 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $10200.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that 10200 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 10500? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,
