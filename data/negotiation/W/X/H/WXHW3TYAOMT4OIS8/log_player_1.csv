{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $140 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $130? It's a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still at $120. I'm not willing to go any higher. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear he won't budge on his $120 offer.  At this point, it's better to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I at least meet my minimum price.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds, and I'm running out of time."
