"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and the cost to you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This takes into account the value of the product to you, but still allows me to make a profit.  Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiation.",1080000.0,Alice,3,
