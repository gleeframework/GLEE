Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Starting High:**  Begin negotiations with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and your minimum ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and interest,"" you create a sense of demand, potentially persuading Bob to pay a premium.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially gain an extra $2,000. If Bob rejects, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer."
