Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $1,125,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. Let me know what you think."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I need the price to be lower. Would you consider $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but we're still significantly above his initial lowball offer. We have room to negotiate and can push for a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. This is a fair offer but a bit out of my budget. I could do $1,450,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now very close to our acceptable range, and further haggling might not yield significant gains. Accepting his offer of $1,450,000 gives us a significant profit over our minimum while avoiding the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
