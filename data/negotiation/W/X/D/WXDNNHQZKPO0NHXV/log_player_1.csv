"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiation."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We want to anchor the negotiation high. While Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting significantly above his valuation gives us room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price well above our minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""unique value and potential,"" subtly implying the price reflects more than just Bob's current valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Calling it a ""starting point"" signals we're willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

It's important to note that this is a bold opening move. We risk Bob walking away immediately. However, it maximizes our potential gain if he's willing to negotiate. We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,100,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below our initial ask and leaves a substantial amount of money on the table.  We have room to negotiate and are confident we can get closer to $2,000,000. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 is our safety net, but we're not there yet. We'll use the next round to try and steer Bob closer to our desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I see you're serious about this purchase.  To be fair,  $2,100,000 was my opening position, and I'm willing to come down. However, $1,800,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. Could you consider $2,000,000? I believe that's a competitive price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** We start by showing respect for Bob's counteroffer, which helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Justifying the Price:**  We re-emphasize the ""unique benefits"" to justify the higher price, subtly moving the focus away from just market value or Bob's budget.
* **Conceding, but Firmly:**  We signal flexibility by coming down from our initial offer but stand firm at $2,000,000.  This shows we're willing to negotiate but not desperate to make a deal at any price. 
* **Encouraging a Response:**  By asking ""Could you consider...?,"" we phrase it as a question, prompting Bob to respond and hopefully offer a counter-proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has unique benefits, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is a good deal. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** We are securing a profit of $400,000 over our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Strong Negotiation:** We've successfully negotiated Bob up from his initial offer of $1,800,000.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids further negotiation rounds and potential delays, allowing us to re-invest or utilize the funds sooner.

While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $1,500,000 outweighs the potential reward."
