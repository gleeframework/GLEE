Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, aiming higher with Bob is key to maximizing profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying significantly above our minimum. This price point also ensures we capture a large portion of the value difference ($500,000) between what Bob values the product at and our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes exclusivity and value, making Bob feel like he's getting a special opportunity. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is just the opening offer. We need to be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters, but always keeping our $1,000,000 minimum in mind."
