"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'd be willing to offer $700000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for $700000. Considering its true value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750000, which is a good middle ground and allows us both to make a deal.  Let's see if we can close this out.  What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750000. Considering its value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
