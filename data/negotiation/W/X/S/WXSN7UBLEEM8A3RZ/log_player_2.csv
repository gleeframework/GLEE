"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still quite high, leaving significant room for negotiation. Since you have a backup option with John, it's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'd be willing to offer $700,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for $700000. Considering its true value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my ideal target. Since I have a backup option with John, I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750000. Considering its value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to a price of $800,000. While I would prefer to pay less, this price is still significantly less than my backup option of $1,500,000 with John.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the product by trying to negotiate further."
