"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make the purchase. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant discount from my original asking price. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it would still allow you to make a profit on your investment.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a significant step from my previous offer.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $875,000, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.  How about we split the difference and meet at $925,000?  This is a good price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.  What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
