"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  Given its unique capabilities and potential, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet halfway at $1050000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still providing you with a great deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than this.",950000.0,Bob,4,
