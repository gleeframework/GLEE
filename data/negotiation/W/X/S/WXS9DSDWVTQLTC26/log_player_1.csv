"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000.  It's a valuable piece and I think you'd find it quite useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the value of the product to pique Bob's interest.

**Note:** This is just a starting point. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum of $10,000.  
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  I have 10 rounds to close the deal, so there's still time to try and get a better price from Bob. 
* **Sell to John is an option:**  I'm keeping the option of selling to John open, but I'm not ready to do that yet.  

**Next Step:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of this item.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer of $12,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer, showing flexibility. It's also a considerable step up from Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm open to negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message polite and encouraging to maintain a positive negotiation environment. 

**Next Step:**

I'll assess Bob's response to my counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If Bob's counteroffer is still significantly lower, I might consider selling to John to avoid wasting time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still giving you a good price.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I'm confident that I can reach a better price through continued negotiation.  I still have 6 rounds to close the deal. 
* **Selling to John is a tempting option:** However, I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Step:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to close the gap further and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  I'm open to continuing the conversation, but if we can't reach an agreement soon, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  My counteroffer of $10,500 is a small step down from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility, while still being above my minimum. 
* **Time pressure:**  I'm subtly adding some time pressure by mentioning other options if we can't reach an agreement soon. This could incentivize Bob to agree to a price closer to my minimum.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message polite and open to continuing the conversation, avoiding any aggressive or confrontational language. 

**Next Step:**

I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response to my counteroffer. If it's still too low, I might need to seriously consider selling to John. However, if Bob shows a willingness to move closer to my desired price, I'll continue to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to pay $9000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $10,000.
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, I'm starting to run out of time to negotiate a better price.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:** Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me my minimum price.  It's a risk to continue negotiating with Bob, as he might not be willing to budge further.

**Conclusion:**

I've decided to sell the product to John to ensure I get my minimum value and avoid any further risk."
