"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Reason: Alice's offer is way above your maximum price and what it's worth to you. It's time to negotiate down or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than Alice's asking price ($15,000) and my maximum budget ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauging Flexibility:** This low offer will help me understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have John's offer of $10,000 in my back pocket, which gives me leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $12,000? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Reason: Alice is coming down, but $12,000 is still more than I want to pay, especially when I know John will sell it for $10,000.  I'll make one more counter-offer to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000? That's the absolute most I can offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm presenting this as my best and final offer to signal seriousness.
* **John's Price:** I'm matching John's offer, showing Alice I have an alternative and won't go higher. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance Alice will reject this, and I'll have to buy from John. However, there's also a chance she'll accept, saving me the hassle of going elsewhere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but $10,000 is still $2,000 below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $13,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Reason: Alice is unwilling to budge below $13,000. It's clear we've reached an impasse. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's guaranteed offer of $10,000, even if it means not getting the product from Alice."
