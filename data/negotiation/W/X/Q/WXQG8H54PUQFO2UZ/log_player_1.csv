"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time. This is my maximum offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if I can get a better offer from Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough. The product's value is significantly higher, and I'm confident you'll realize that upon closer examination. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1500000 is still a bit higher than I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1200000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and our current negotiation. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get more, his offer of $1,200,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether."
