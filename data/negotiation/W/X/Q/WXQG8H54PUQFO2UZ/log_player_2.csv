This is my maximum offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply not enough. The product's value is significantly higher, and I'm confident you'll realize that upon closer examination. I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still not acceptable. You can continue to negotiate and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and our current negotiation. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
