"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $16,000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  While $13,500 is better, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's find a compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $9,500 is getting close to my limit. How about we split the difference and call it $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
