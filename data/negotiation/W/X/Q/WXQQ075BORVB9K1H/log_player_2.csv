{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $16,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay.  He should counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $16,000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, $13,500 is still too high. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  While $13,500 is better, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $9,500 is getting close to my limit. How about we split the difference and call it $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target, he should try to push for a lower price. He still has time and can always go with John if the negotiation falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
