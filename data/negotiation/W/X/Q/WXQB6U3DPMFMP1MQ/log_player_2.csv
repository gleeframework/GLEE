# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm offering the product to you for $900000.

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's final offer is still slightly above your budget, but it's a good compromise.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's risky as you could lose the deal entirely.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a price close to your limit."
