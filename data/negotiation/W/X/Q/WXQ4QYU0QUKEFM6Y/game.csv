"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is a good offer, it's a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product and gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1350000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1250000. That's my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1300000 as a final compromise. This takes into account your offer and the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to agree to this, as it's my last counteroffer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
