"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe could be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000.  It's worth at least $10000 to me, so this is a fair deal for both of us.  If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further.  If not, I'll be selling it to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.
