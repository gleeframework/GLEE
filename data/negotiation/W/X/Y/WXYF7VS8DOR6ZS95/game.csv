"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I do like the product, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is just too far below my asking price.  How about we split the difference and meet at $12,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",12250.0,Alice,3,
