"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I do like the product, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Not Insulting:** While low, $10,500 is still a reasonable amount and shows I'm serious about buying. 
* **Leaving Room:**  This leaves space for Alice to counter, and for me to potentially meet in the middle somewhere closer to my $12,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is just too far below my asking price.  How about we split the difference and meet at $12,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Within Budget:**  $12,250 is slightly above my ideal price, but still under my $12,000 limit. 
* **Good Compromise:** Alice met me halfway from our previous offers, indicating she's willing to negotiate.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price."
