"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement on a lower price.",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8200 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm asking for $9000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $8500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,
