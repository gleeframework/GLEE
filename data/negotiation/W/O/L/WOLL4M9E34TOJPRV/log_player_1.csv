Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $775,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm firm on $800,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet that price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
