"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it holds significant value for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $900,000, but I'm open to discussion. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle on $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This price still reflects the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable margin for you.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we split the difference again and land at $775,000? ",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $775,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm firm on $800,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet that price, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
