"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which reflects its value to me.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000.
