Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, as I know John is willing to pay that much. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I could accept it and make a small profit, I'm willing to risk a bit more to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering a slight compromise at $115. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  It's also a good middle ground between my minimum acceptable price and his offer."
