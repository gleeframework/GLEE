{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $175. This is way more than I'm willing to pay. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $80.  This is fair, as the product is worth that much to me and less than half of what it's worth to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Alice's offer is still too high. I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm willing to go up a bit to $90.  This is a fair compromise, as it's still lower than Alice's offer and closer to my maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $110 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to go with John's offer of $80.  It's the best deal for me."
