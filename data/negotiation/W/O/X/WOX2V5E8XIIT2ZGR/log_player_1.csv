"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's below what the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum. This should hopefully encourage him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $130?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
