Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room for potential bargaining.  It also highlights the value Bob would get from the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate it.  However, I'm looking to get the product for a bit less.  How about $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I'm not ready to settle yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $9,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  It's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - how about $9,875? I'm confident we can find common ground at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,875 is a very good deal and is only slightly less than my last counteroffer. It's also a significant improvement over selling to John for $8,000.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and conclude the negotiation."
