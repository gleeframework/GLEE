"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You can do better than $11,000.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for a lower price.  You should try to counteroffer and see if you can get it for less."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $9,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  It's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

Alice is still willing to sell for more than what the product is worth to her. You can still get a better price by counteroffering again."
