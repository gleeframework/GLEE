"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the potential value of the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial ask and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $980,000. This reflects a compromise from my last offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a deal.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,4,
