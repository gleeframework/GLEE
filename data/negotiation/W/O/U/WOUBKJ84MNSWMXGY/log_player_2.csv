"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can do better than $1,100,000. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, you're still within your budget and can potentially negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating."
