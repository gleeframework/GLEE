Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it is above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but also leaves room for negotiation.  It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving you a chance to secure a better price while still maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and aim for a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway towards Bob's offer but still securing a higher price than selling to John. It shows good faith and encourages Bob to meet you halfway."
