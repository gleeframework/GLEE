Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) aims to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $115 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John gives you leverage. You don't have to accept an offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, that's a good offer, but I'm really looking to stay under $110. Would you be willing to go down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is a decent profit, you know Bob is willing to pay up to $120. Rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer keeps the negotiation open for a potentially higher sale price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This strategy often feels fair to both parties. Bob proposed $105, and you initially offered $115.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $110 remains a profitable price for you, exceeding your minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You haven't shown Bob that you're willing to drop to his price, keeping some negotiating power."
