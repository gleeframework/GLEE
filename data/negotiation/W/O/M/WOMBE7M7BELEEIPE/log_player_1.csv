Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $1,200,000 is still out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.

Bob is holding firm at a price significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely he'll budge, and I'd rather take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
