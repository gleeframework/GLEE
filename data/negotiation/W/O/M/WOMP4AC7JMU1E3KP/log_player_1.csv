"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested in this product and what his budget might be."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try and counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."

I'm countering with $1,850,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating my desire for a higher price but still showing flexibility. With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to find a compromise that will work for both of us."
