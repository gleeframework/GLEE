Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, considering its potential value to me.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I've done extensive research and analysis, and similar products have commanded significantly higher prices in the market.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob is determined to get the best deal possible and isn't willing to pay more than $1,200,000 at this point. He'll continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the market value, but $1,950,000 remains too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000 for the product.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best we can both achieve."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
