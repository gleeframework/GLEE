"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can offer at this point. Let's close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10,750 still doesn't quite work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,875?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm really keen on closing this deal with you.",10875.0,Alice,5,
