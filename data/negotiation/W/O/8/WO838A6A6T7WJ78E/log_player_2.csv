"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This gives you a significant discount compared to what it's truly worth. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $925,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or move on to John. 
* John's offer of $1,000,000 acts as your absolute maximum price, but there's room to potentially get a better deal."
