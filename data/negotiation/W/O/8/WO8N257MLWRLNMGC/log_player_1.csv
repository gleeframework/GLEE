Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm looking to invest around $1,000,000 in something like this.  Would you be open to a price closer to that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
