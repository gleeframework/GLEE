"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation to get a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm looking to invest around $1,000,000 in something like this.  Would you be open to a price closer to that range?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer establishes a strong initial position. While it's significantly lower than Alice's starting price, it's still within the realm of possibility, especially since it's substantially higher than her product valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer gives us space to negotiate upwards while still likely staying well below our $1,500,000 walk-away point.
* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintaining a positive tone throughout the negotiation encourages continued discussion and a potentially amicable agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  To be frank, $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,175,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit from her initial offer, but she's still aiming for a price well above her valuation. We've successfully established that we're willing to walk away, giving us some leverage to push for a more favorable outcome.  There's no rush to accept her current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer, but $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle on $1,075,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're showing Alice that we're willing to negotiate and move towards her price, but we're doing it in measured steps.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:**  By countering with $1,075,000, we're aiming for a price roughly halfway between our last offer and her counteroffer. This can signal that we're looking for a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We're still significantly below her current offer and even further below her initial asking price. This keeps the pressure on Alice to either accept a lower price or continue moving closer to our range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we are getting close.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000.  Would you be willing to do $1,125,000?  That's a significant price reduction from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably in price, and we're now at a point where the deal is quite favorable. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** We're at $1,125,000, which is $375,000 less than John's offer and a $175,000 reduction from Alice's initial price.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly lower price, but the potential savings are likely to be small.  It's often better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it by pushing too hard.
* **Time and Effort:** Negotiation takes time and energy.  Accepting now allows us to move forward with the purchase.

While we could aim for a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for a marginal improvement."
