"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this price is fair, reflecting both the product's value and my ability to purchase it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective on the product's value. While I understand your position, the product offers significant long-term potential that justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects my desire to reach a deal while ensuring a fair return on this unique asset.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,100,000. It's a fair price, considering the value I see in the product and my budget constraints. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm keen on finding a solution that works for both of us. To that end, could you elaborate on the factors limiting the price you're willing to pay? Perhaps there are alternative deal structures we can explore. For instance, would a payment plan with installments be more manageable while still reflecting the product's true value? Let's get creative and see if we can bridge this gap.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to explore options, but I'm still focused on finding a price that works within my budget. While a payment plan is interesting, I'm currently unable to commit to any extended payment plans.  To move forward, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This reflects my commitment to the product while staying within my financial limits.  Let's see if we can bridge the remaining gap.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready at $1,500,000. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value the potential I see in this partnership with you.  Therefore, I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,600,000. This reflects my commitment to making this deal work while ensuring a fair value for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your position and your other buyer's offer, but I'm still struggling to reach your asking price. However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. Given the value I see in this product and my current financial constraints, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
