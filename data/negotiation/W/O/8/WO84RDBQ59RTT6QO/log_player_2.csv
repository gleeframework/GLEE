"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal compared to John's price, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $87.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $87.50 is a good compromise, and it's still below your maximum price of $120. Accepting the offer saves you money compared to buying from John and ensures you get the product.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
