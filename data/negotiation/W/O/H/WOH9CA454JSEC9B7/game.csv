"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere.",10000.0,Bob,4,
