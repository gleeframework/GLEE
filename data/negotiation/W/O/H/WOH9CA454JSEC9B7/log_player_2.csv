"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Bob starts with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, knowing Alice is motivated to sell. 
* **Justification:**  He provides a reason for the lower price (his budget), making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $9,500 leaves some room for Alice to counter without feeling pressured to accept immediately."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his desired price.  Rejecting the offer gives him a chance to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob is now making his final offer, emphasizing that it's his absolute maximum. This creates pressure on Alice.
* **Direct & Concise:**  The message is direct, stating his final price and the consequences of rejection.
* **Appeal to Logic:**  He appeals to logic by highlighting the fact that he's already offered his maximum."
