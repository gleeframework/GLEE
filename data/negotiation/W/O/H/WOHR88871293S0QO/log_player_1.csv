This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for potential compromise. This allows me to maximize my profit while also leaving space for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I can only go up to $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, so let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than what John is offering and only slightly lower than my last counteroffer. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to settle for John's lower price."
