"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, and given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a good price that reflects its value without being too high.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $12,000 is certainly a fair price, I believe the true value of this product is higher.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $13,500 is a good price. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but I'm hoping we can do better than that. Can we meet somewhere in the middle of that, around $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,4,
