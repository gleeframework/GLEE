Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 starts the negotiation in my favor. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The price is still below the product's value to Bob ($120), giving him incentive to negotiate but also allowing me to make a profit.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and positive tone can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  That way we both get a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  $90 is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also allows me to make a decent profit. 
* **Reiterate value:**  By mentioning a ""fair deal"", I subtly remind Bob of the value of the product to him.
* **Keep it friendly:** A positive tone can help maintain a good relationship and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I would prefer to get closer to $90, accepting his offer ensures I secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
