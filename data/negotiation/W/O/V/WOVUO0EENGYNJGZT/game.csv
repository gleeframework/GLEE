"Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $115?  It's closer to what I'm willing to pay, and I think it's a fair compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and sell the product to you for $125. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
