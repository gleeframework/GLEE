"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We're aiming to spend less than $130, so we should make a counteroffer.  There's no need to buy from John yet since we have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer might encourage her to move down more significantly as well.
* **Polite and Interested:** Maintaining a positive tone is important for a smooth negotiation. We express our interest while firmly stating our price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:**  While $125 is closer to our goal, we have time and rounds on our side. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation moving and might incentivize Alice to drop her price further.
* **John is the Backup:**  We always have the option to go with John at $150, so there's no immediate pressure to accept an offer we're not completely happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $115? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($125) and our previous one ($100). This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Framing as Win-Win:**  By stating it's a fair deal for both, we emphasize mutual benefit and encourage agreement. 
* **Leaving Room:** We still have some wiggle room to go up slightly if needed, while staying below our $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a fair deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $127.50. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice is moving very slowly in her price reductions. This suggests she might be willing to hold out closer to her original price.
* **Time for a Stronger Stance:**  We need to signal that we're serious about a lower price.  Simply countering with a small increase might not be effective.
* **John is Still an Option:**  We're getting closer to our limit, but we still have John as a backup if negotiations stall completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $127.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  If that works for you, I'm ready to make the deal."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're sticking close to our previous offer to signal a firm stance.  A $10 jump from $100 to $110 is significant and shows we're serious about our budget.
* **Deadline Approaching:** With fewer rounds remaining, we need to increase the pace of negotiation and make our position clear.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating ""I'm ready to make the deal,"" we add a bit of pressure and encourage Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $123. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $123. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $123
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $123 is a reasonable price and fairly close to our target. We've negotiated well.
* **Limited Rounds:** We only have a few rounds left, and further haggling might not yield much improvement.
* **Risk of Losing Out:** Alice might not budge much more, and we risk ending up with a worse deal if we push too hard."
