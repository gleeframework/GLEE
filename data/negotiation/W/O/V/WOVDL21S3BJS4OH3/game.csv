"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,900,000.  What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $1,200,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $1,200,000 is below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done. How about we meet halfway at $1,550,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,550,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you've clearly recognized the value in this product. Let's close this gap - I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair and reflects the immense potential this product holds for you.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and is the highest I'm able to go right now. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
