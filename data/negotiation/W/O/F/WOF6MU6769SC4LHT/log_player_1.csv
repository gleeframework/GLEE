Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway?

I'm aiming for a higher price than $9,000, and I have more rounds to try and get closer to what I want.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about $9,500? That's a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal on this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 9500}

While $8,800 is close to what John is offering, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if I can get closer to my goal of $10,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,800 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,100? This gives you a fantastic deal on a product you value at $12,000."", ""product_price"": 9100}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

While I'd like to keep negotiating with Bob, his offers are getting too low.  It's clear he's not willing to come up much higher. At this point, I'd rather take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk getting stuck with an even lower price from Bob."
