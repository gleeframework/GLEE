Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.
* **Backup Plan:**  The offer is still significantly higher than John's $800,000 offer, ensuring a good profit even if Bob declines."
