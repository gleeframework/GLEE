Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $90, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what Bob values it at. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters.  It's important to be polite and frame the offer as fair to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $80.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $75 is a bit too low for me, considering what the product is worth.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $82.50?  That would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 82.5} 
```

I'm splitting the difference between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price.  I'm also framing it as a ""fair compromise"" to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $78 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below it. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price.  It's best to take the guaranteed $80 from John at this point."
