"Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $10,000. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're not ready to go down to $10,000, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a good middle ground.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
