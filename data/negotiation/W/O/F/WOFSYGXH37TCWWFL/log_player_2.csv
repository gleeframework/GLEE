"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth much more to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to lower the price further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is fair to both parties.  He is offering $10,000, which is still a profit for Alice, but a significant discount from her initial offer. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $10,000. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob wants to pay. He wants to explore if he can get closer to his target price of $10,000 by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're not ready to go down to $10,000, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a good middle ground.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small compromise, but still trying to get a better price. He is offering a price that is closer to his target of $10,000. This shows he is serious about buying the product, but is also trying to negotiate a fair deal."
