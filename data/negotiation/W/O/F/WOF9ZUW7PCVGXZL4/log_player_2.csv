"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $20,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($20,000) but still higher than your maximum budget ($10,000) gives room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message conveys your interest in the product while establishing your budget constraint. 
* **Price:** $12,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving space for Alice to counter while still keeping the negotiation within your budget range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $12,000. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:**  I'm sticking with my initial counteroffer of $12,000. This demonstrates my seriousness and that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Reiterating Interest:**  The message emphasizes my continued interest in the product, encouraging Alice to consider a compromise. 
* **No Further Concessions:**  It's important to maintain a firm stance to avoid being pressured into a price I'm not comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value meeting in the middle, I need to get a bit closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $15,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  Alice's offer of $15,500 is still outside my budget of $10,000.  
* **Risk of Going Over:** Accepting this offer would mean spending significantly more than I'm comfortable with.
* **Possibility of Better Deal:**  It's worth trying to negotiate further or consider buying from John as a safer option."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a better price, but $15,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm presenting this as my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to consider a compromise.
* **Incremental Increase:** I've increased my offer slightly from $12,000 to $13,000, showing a willingness to negotiate but not giving in completely.
* **Emphasis on Limits:** The message highlights that I'm approaching my maximum budget,  putting pressure on Alice to make a decision."
