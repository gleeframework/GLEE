"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal at this price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the ""steal"" aspect to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Direct Approach:** I'm directly asking Bob for his thoughts to start the conversation.

**Strategy:**  I want to establish a high starting point to maximize my potential earnings. I'm also aware that if Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiations to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:**  I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially given Bob's initial response suggesting he's interested.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer knowing I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob don't yield a better result."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the value you'll get from the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating, hoping to close the gap further. 

**Strategy:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm seeing progress in the negotiations, and I believe there's still room to get a better price.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer knowing I have a fallback option with John's $1,000,000 offer. However, I'm still aiming for a better outcome if possible."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm continuing to show flexibility by reducing my price again, but I'm only moving slightly from my previous offer.

* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we're ""almost there"" to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm trying to bridge the gap between our desired prices, making a final push to get closer to my desired outcome.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I need to stay firm on my price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $937,500. It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.  Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 937500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $937,500 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $920,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for both of us. We're very close to an agreement, let's make this happen!  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, and while Bob's offer of $920,000 is close to my minimum, it's still not quite there.  I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or further concessions that might leave me with a lower price than John's offer.  Given the time pressure and the possibility of a less favorable outcome with Bob, I'm going to choose to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  This guarantees a secure and acceptable outcome for me. 

**Strategy:**

* **Risk Assessment:** I'm weighing the potential risks of further negotiation with Bob against the guaranteed outcome of selling to John.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only a few rounds remaining, I'm prioritizing a quick and certain sale.
* **Prioritizing Profit:**  While $1,000,000 isn't my ideal price, it's a solid profit and ensures I don't lose out on the opportunity to sell at a higher price."
