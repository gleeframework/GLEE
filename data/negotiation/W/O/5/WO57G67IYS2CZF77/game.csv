"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $725,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I hope you'll consider this offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
