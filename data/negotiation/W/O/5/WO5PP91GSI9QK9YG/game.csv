"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. I hope this suggestion is within your acceptable range.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This price still allows for a good margin for you, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand that $875,000 is still above my preferred price point, but I am willing to negotiate further.
