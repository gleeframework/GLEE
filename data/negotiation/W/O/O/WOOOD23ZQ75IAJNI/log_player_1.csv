Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Confidence:** Presenting a confident offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for higher profit."
