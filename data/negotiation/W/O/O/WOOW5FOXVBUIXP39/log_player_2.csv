"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $12,000.** This is your maximum budget, so there's no immediate advantage to accepting.
* **You can buy from John for the same price.** This means there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate with Alice or explore other options.** You might be able to get a better price from Alice later.

Therefore, rejecting the offer is the best strategy in this situation."
