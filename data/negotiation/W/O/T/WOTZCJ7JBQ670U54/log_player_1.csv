Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($80) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds."

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe the product is worth more than $80. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $90 for a quick deal. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I was thinking more like $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $90. I'll try to negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have preferred $87.50, it's a good deal, and I'm worried that if I continue to negotiate, I might not be able to close the deal and end up selling to John for $80. It's better to secure a slightly lower price than risk getting nothing at all."
