"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1300000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth the price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  While the product may be valuable, it's important to stick to your financial constraints.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's closer to your desired price, it's still not within your range.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
