Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70.

``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85?  This price still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $77.5 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $77.50 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $82.50. This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about making this deal happen. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. 

Although Bob's offer of $78 is tempting, we've reached a point where our negotiations seem to be stagnating. I'm confident that John will buy the product at my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out on any potential profits."
