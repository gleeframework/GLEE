Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $950,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.** This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers.
* **It's lower than the product's worth to Bob of $1,000,000.**  This makes the offer appealing to him, giving him potential to save money.

By starting with this offer, I aim to secure a price closer to the product's true value while still leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I could sell to John for $800,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  

By rejecting his offer, I can make a counter-offer closer to my desired price point and try to reach a more mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering Bob at $850,000. This is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer of $700,000:**  This shows I'm willing to compromise but not cave completely.
* **Lower than my initial offer of $950,000:** This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000:** This ensures I get a good deal while keeping the negotiation going.

This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground and hopefully lead to a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $650,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of further concessions leading to an even lower price is high.  

Given that John is willing to buy the product for $800,000, which is a better deal than Bob's current offer, I'm choosing to sell the product to John. This ensures I get a fair price and avoid the uncertainty of continued negotiation with Bob."
