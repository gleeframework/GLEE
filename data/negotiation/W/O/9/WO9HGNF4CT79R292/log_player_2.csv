"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget, so it's worth exploring if I can get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows me to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A price of $250,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise and gives me a strong starting point for bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still significantly higher than my initial counteroffer. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows me to continue exploring a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $300,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's last offer.  I'm hoping that this shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate and come to a reasonable price, but I still want to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $350,000 is getting closer to my target price and represents a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.  While I'd like to continue negotiating, I'm concerned about running out of rounds and having to accept John's much higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product for a good price and allows me to move on."
