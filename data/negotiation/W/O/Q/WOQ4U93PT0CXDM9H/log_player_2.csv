"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial value, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price, potentially saving more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money.  While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still potentially negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and see if he can reach a price closer to $10,000."
