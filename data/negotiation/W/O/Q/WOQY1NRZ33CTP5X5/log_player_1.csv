Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my earnings. It's important to be clear about the value of the product for me, and I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100, and I can always get that from John. I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $65 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above my minimum threshold. I want to give Bob a chance to come closer to my desired price while still having a safety net with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $80 is closer to my minimum, it's still not profitable enough. I'm confident that I can get $100 from John, so I'm going to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John."
