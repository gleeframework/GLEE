This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $150.  This allows for some room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers, while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $145. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $145 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me at that price?
