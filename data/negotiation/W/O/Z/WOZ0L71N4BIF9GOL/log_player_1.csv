Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from its base value to you. This aims to maximize potential profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests you're open to discussing the price further, giving Bob the impression that a deal can be reached.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale, aiming for the highest possible profit while managing the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
