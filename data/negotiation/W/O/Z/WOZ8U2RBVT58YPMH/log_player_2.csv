Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  I believe this price point makes it a very attractive offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. Let's meet halfway at $14,500. This is my final offer.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $14,500.  While she might come down a little more, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to this price.  Buying from John at $8,000 guarantees the best possible price and avoids further negotiation."
