"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to demonstrate my commitment to getting this deal done. This offer takes into account the immense value it can bring to your specific needs.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  I can go up to $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're making progress, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I can stretch my budget to $800,000.  This is my final offer.  I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. If you can't accept it, I'll need to pursue other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,

Let me know if you're willing to move forward at this price.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
