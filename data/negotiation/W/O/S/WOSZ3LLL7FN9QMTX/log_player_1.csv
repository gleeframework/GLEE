I'm starting with a price of $200.  This gives Bob a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation if he's interested but thinks the price is too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $175. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
