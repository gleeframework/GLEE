"Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $11,000. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us. ",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about we try $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
