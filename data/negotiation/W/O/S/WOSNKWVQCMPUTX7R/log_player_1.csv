Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something that could be very valuable to you, so I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no reason to sell to Bob for less. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price anchors the negotiation and leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:** Framing the offer as ""exclusive"" might make Bob feel like it's a limited-time chance, potentially pushing him to accept.

**Important Note:**  While this strategy aims for the highest possible profit, be prepared for Bob to potentially reject the offer. You always have John as a backup buyer."
