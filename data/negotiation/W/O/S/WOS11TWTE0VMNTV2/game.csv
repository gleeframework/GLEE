"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go down to $8800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8800 is still too far below my desired price.  Would you be willing to go up to $8900?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8800. Would you be willing to meet me at $8750? I'm really close to walking away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,6,
