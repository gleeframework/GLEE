Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum of $10,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my goal before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go down to $8800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a bit more.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, so I'll see if I can get closer to $9,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is still too far below my desired price.  Would you be willing to go up to $8,900?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8800. Would you be willing to meet me at $8750? I'm really close to walking away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, we're running out of rounds, and I'm getting nervous that I won't be able to get a better deal. It's better to take the sure thing and sell to John for $10,000."
