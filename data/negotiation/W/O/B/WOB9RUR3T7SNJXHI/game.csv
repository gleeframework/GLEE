"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me right now. How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's still a great deal for you and allows me to get closer to my target price.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm willing to pay that price",125.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle at $128.  This price gives you a great value and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?",128.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $128 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $122 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",122.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $122 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finally close this deal.  Let's make this happen!",125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure if we can meet in the middle at $125, but I'm willing to pay $123 for the product. That's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",123.0,Bob,8,
