"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still gives you a great deal and allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This feels like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
