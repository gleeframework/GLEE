Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know has significant value to you.  Given its potential for your business, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. My starting offer is $950,000. I'm open to discussing a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, $700,000 is too low.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still gives you a great deal and allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum threshold and it's the best deal I've received so far. Accepting this offer will allow me to move on without risking further negotiation with Bob or losing out to John."
