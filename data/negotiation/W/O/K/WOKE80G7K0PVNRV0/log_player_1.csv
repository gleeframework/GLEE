Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a bit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" I subtly imply that the product is worth the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My tone is not demanding. Instead, I ask ""What do you think?"" to encourage Bob to engage in a discussion and potentially negotiate.

I'm aiming to secure a price higher than my minimum, but I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 if Bob declines."
