"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a compromise that I hope we can both agree on.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $875,000. This is a fair price that I believe is reasonable for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $875,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $890,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  If not, I'll have to consider other options.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you've made a final offer, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $890,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $895,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",895000.0,Alice,7,
