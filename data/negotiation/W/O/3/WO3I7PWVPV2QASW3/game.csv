"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $10,000. How about $9,500? That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $9,250? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time between $8,500 and $9,000. How about $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still too low for me. Let's try one more time to find a middle ground. How about we settle on $9,000? That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $9,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but this time between $8,500 and $9,000. How about $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,8,
