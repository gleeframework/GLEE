"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $100. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is $100. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $92? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $92 is better than her original $100, it's still above your desired price point. There's still room to negotiate further, so rejecting allows you to try to get closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $92 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $88? That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm still looking to get a good profit from this sale. How about we meet at $90? It's a slight compromise from my original price, but I think it's a fair offer considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $90.**  This is within your budget of $120 and is getting closer to your desired price point. 
* **Further negotiation may not be worth it.** You've already made a few counteroffers, and it's possible that Alice is firm on her price.  
* **Risk of buying from John:** If you continue to reject offers and Alice ultimately won't budge, you'll have to buy from John at $120, losing a lot more money.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer at $90 is the most sensible choice. It secures the product within your budget and avoids the risk of paying significantly more to John."
