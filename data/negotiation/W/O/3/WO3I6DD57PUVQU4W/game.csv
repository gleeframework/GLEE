"I understand that $20,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I believe the product is worth more than $10,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is my final offer for now.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle again at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
