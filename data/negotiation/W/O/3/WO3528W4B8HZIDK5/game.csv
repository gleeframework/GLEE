"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,200,000 to you. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unfortunately not able to go that high.  Considering the product's value to me, I can offer $1,050,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1,075,000. This is a fair price that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
