Round 2
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping I can get closer to my initial asking price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to make a bit more on this product.  How about $125? That's still a great price for something you'll really enjoy."", ""product_price"": 125}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I've been thinking about it and I'm still only able to offer $120 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob has been persistent with his $120 offer, and it's clear he won't budge.  Since $120 is my minimum, it's time to accept his offer and close the deal."
