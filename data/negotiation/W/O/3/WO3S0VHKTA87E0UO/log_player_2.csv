"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that being said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my target price as possible.

Round 2

This price is a fair compromise and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to come down in price. While $1,050,000 is a step closer, it's still a bit too high for me.

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm again making a counteroffer, this time moving up from my previous offer of $900,000.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm to my budget.

While Alice's price is getting closer to my target, we're running out of rounds. I've already made several concessions, and it seems unlikely that Alice will go below $1,000,000. To avoid further negotiation and potentially missing out on a better deal, I'll buy the product from John for $800,000."
