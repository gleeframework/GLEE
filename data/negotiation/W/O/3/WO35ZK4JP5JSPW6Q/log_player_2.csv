"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $11,500. He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. While John is selling for $12,000, Bob can use that as leverage to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price slightly above that, hoping Alice will accept to avoid losing the deal entirely.  This counteroffer is a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is still within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or raise the price again.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
