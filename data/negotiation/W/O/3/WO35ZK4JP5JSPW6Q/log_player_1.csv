Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.  I believe Bob will find this price attractive, given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, but it's closer. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my ideal. There's a chance he might accept it, or we can continue negotiating.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I can potentially make more with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate while still ensuring a good profit for myself. I believe this price is fair and attractive for Bob, considering the value of the product to him."
