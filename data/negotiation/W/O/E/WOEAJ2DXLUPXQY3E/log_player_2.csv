"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the market value of the product is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $900,000 is a decent price, you know you have another option with John for $1,200,000.  There's room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a price closer to her $800,000 valuation."
