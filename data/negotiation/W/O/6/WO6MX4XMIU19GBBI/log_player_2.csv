Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $12,000. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $13,200.
