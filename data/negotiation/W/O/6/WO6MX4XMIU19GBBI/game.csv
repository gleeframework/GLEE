"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $12,000. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to budge a bit to avoid dragging this out. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $13,200. It's a bit above your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,7,
