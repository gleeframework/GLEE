"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $105? That's a fair compromise.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $105, which would be $92.50. Can you consider that?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference between our last two offers? I'd be willing to sell it for $98.75.",98.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,6,
