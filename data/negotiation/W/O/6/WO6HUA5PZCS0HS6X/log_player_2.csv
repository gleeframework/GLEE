"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice's offer is below that, it makes sense to try and negotiate further. I can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm offering $80 for the product. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than my previous counteroffer. However, I'm still willing to negotiate further. It's possible I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $85. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest one, and hopefully shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, but I'm concerned about how much higher it might go if I continue to reject her offers.  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of not getting the product is too high. I'll go with John's offer and ensure I get the product within my budget."
