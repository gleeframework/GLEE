"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's significantly more than your $800,000 limit and even above her own valuation.  You should reject this offer and try to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit on what I can spend.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** Starting with a much lower offer ($700,000) leaves room for negotiation while signaling your price range. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning your spending limit, you provide a reason for the low offer without completely revealing your hand.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""closer to $700,000"" implies flexibility and invites Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,300,000 represents the high end of its value,  $700,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects my desire to find a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has reduced her price, it's still significantly higher than your budget and what you're willing to pay. It's clear you need to continue negotiating to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still significantly more than I had budgeted for this purchase.  To be honest, I'm working with a hard limit around $800,000.  If you're able to get closer to that number, I'm very interested in making this deal work. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reveal Your Limit (Strategically):** It's time to introduce your actual budget limit.  By stating it's a ""hard limit,"" you increase the pressure on Alice.
* **Show Seriousness:**  Expressing your genuine interest and mentioning ""other options"" (John's offer) signals that you're willing to walk away if needed.
* **Clear Target:** Offering $800,000 gives Alice a clear target and encourages her to make a more significant move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the gap between our positions is substantial.  I've already made significant concessions. I'm open to a final offer, but it needs to be closer to my valuation. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000.  However, I want to be transparent that I have other opportunities available if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice's offer is still double your budget. While her tone suggests urgency, it's essential to remain firm with your limit.
* **Posturing:** Both sides are now employing tactics to create a sense of urgency. Don't let her ""other opportunities"" statement pressure you into a bad deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a significant gap between her offer and your last counteroffer.  You have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too far from what I can agree to.  I understand this product has value, but I need to be realistic about my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This offer stands as a sign of my serious interest, but I do have other options if we can't find a compromise."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While still a significant jump from your $800,000 limit, offering $1,200,000 shows willingness to compromise while staying within a reasonable range.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This classic negotiation tactic can be persuasive, even if the ""middle ground"" is more favorable to you. 
* **Reiteration:**  Reiterating your budget concerns and the existence of ""other options"" continues to apply pressure without being overly aggressive."
