Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? I'm really serious about getting this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
