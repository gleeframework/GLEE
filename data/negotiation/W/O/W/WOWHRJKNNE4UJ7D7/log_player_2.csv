You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his maximum budget, and there's no reason to accept it right away."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?

You have three options:

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
