"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take advantage of it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can get the product for a lower price than $100, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still aiming to save as much as possible, and $95 is closer to Alice's value than yours. A counteroffer is the best way to try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $92? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 92}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $92. I'm willing to compromise and offer you $93. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $93, which is only slightly higher than your counteroffer of $92.  At this point, it's likely Alice won't go any lower, and you're close to your maximum value for the product. Accepting the offer is the best way to ensure you get the product at a good price."
