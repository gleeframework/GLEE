"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer again in hopes of reaching a deal that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm dropping the price again, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to $160. We're getting closer to a deal and I want to make sure I don't lose out on too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is very close to my minimum,  I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. With only four rounds remaining, I'm willing to risk a counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm dropping my price one last time, but I'm still hoping to get a little more than my minimum.  With only three rounds left, it's getting risky, but I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $125 is only slightly above my minimum, it's the best offer I've received from Bob, and we're running out of time. It's better to secure a sale now than risk a counteroffer and potentially end up selling to John for less."
