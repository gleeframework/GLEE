"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy it for $105. Let me know what you think!",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go any lower than $112.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a decent profit.  Let me know what you think!",112.5,Alice,5,
