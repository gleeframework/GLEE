{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $115.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target price:** My goal is to maximize profit, so I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Negotiation room:** Offering $115 gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing I have a backup buyer at $120 allows me to be more firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy it for $105. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $105 is below my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Negotiation leverage:** I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay $120, giving me the leverage to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Potential for compromise:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows for continued negotiation and the possibility of finding a price that is mutually agreeable."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Mid-ground compromise:** This offer is closer to Bob's offer, showing my willingness to negotiate, but still above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Appealing to value:**  I emphasize the deal being a ""great deal"" for Bob, appealing to his perception of the product's worth.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I still have John as a backup buyer, ensuring that I don't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **John's offer is more attractive:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit, making this option more appealing than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows for another round of negotiation, potentially leading to a price closer to my target. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go any lower than $112.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a decent profit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:**  I'm making a smaller concession this time, showing my willingness to negotiate but still maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Fairness appeal:** I'm framing this price as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity in the transaction.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm still keeping my minimum acceptable value in mind, and John's offer is still a safety net if negotiations fall apart."
