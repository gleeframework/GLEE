"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.

Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
