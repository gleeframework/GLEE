"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $16500. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can you consider my offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest counteroffer of $14000. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,5,
