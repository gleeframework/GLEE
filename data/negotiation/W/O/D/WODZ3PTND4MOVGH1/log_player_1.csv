Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into how badly he wants the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable given the product's value to him."
