"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,250,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,800,000.
