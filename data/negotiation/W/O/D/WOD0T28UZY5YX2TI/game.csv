,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is way out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about meeting halfway at $140? This offer stands as a compromise to get us closer to a deal.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  That's a fair price considering my budget and your asking price.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's split the difference again - how about $120? This gets us closer to a fair deal for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $120 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110. This is the most I can offer, let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,6,
