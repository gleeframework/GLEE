Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping he'll be willing to negotiate. This strategy allows for potential profit while still being open to a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum threshold of $80. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $75? "", ""product_price"": 75}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer.  This shows good faith while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $75. Would you be willing to meet me at $72? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $72 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum threshold. It's also clear that Bob is unlikely to budge further. Accepting his offer is the best way to secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing him entirely."
