"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I can only go as high as $13,500 at the moment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value is quite high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is still a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $15,000. 
* While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.  
* Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a lower price than John's while minimizing the risk of the deal falling through."
