{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to say whether $850,000 is a good deal.  Let's see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  If she's serious about selling, she should be willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but $750,000 is still too high. Let's see if we can get closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but still keep it below Alice's last offer.  I'm aiming for a compromise and hoping we can reach an agreement this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit more, and while $735,000 is still a significant amount, it's getting close to my initial counteroffer. I'm confident that I can get a better deal from John, but I don't want to risk him selling the product to someone else. I'm going to accept Alice's offer and close the deal."
