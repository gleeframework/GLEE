Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $875000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still above your budget. While you're close to a deal, the negotiation isn't progressing quickly enough. You've already rejected several counteroffers and there's a risk of going back and forth indefinitely.  It's more efficient to buy from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
