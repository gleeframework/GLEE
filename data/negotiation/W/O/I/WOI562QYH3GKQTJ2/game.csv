"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $25000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is $15000. Would you be willing to work with me on that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $20000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $20000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement. How about $17500? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and a fair compromise, I think.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $19000, which is a bit above your latest offer, but still a good compromise. I'm hoping we can shake on it and finalize the deal.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $19000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $18000. If we can't come to an agreement on that, I'll have to move forward with John's offer.",18000.0,Bob,6,
