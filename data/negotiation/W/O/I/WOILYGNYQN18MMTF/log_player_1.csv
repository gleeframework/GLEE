Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's valuation is lower than yours, but a high initial offer helps you understand how motivated he is to buy the product.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's less risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob."
