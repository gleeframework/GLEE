"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $10,000 is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product without revealing my minimum price. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming for a middle ground to see if Bob is willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer downwards in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I think the product is worth a good deal, but I'm not willing to pay $10,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $12,000.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate and John is a reliable buyer for $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is simply too low.  The product is worth more than that, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $9,500?  It's a fair price that considers both of our interests."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering $9,500, which is a compromise between my initial $10,000 and Bob's $8,500. 
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and suggesting a fair compromise. I'm not explicitly mentioning my minimum price, but I'm hinting that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Strategy:** By gradually lowering my price, I'm showing flexibility while also trying to inch closer to my target price.  I still have several rounds left to negotiate, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price than Bob's previous offers, it's still below my ideal value. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 

* **Negotiation:** I have 6 rounds left and John is a safe alternative for $12,000. This gives me room to keep negotiating and potentially reach a better deal.
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a risk that Bob might walk away if I reject his offer again, but I'm willing to take that risk for the potential of a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price, but $9,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $9,250?  This would be a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $9,250, which is a small compromise but still closer to my desired price than Bob's last offer. 
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone while emphasizing the value of the product and suggesting a fair compromise. I'm aiming for a win-win situation where both of us feel good about the deal.
* **Strategy:** I'm strategically using ""halfway"" as a negotiation tactic, hoping to signal that I'm open to compromise while still trying to secure a better price. 

I still have 5 rounds left, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer.  I'm confident that I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise again and offer $8,800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Current Situation:** While $8,800 is a better offer than Bob's previous ones, it is still far below my minimum price of $12,000. I have 4 rounds left to negotiate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of rejecting Bob's offer is that he may walk away. However, the reward of potentially securing a higher price in the remaining rounds outweighs the risk.
* **John's Offer:** John is a reliable buyer, offering me $12,000.  This gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Strategy:** 
I will continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to push him closer to my desired price. However, I am keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,800 is still too low for me. I understand we're getting closer, but I'm not comfortable accepting a price that undervalues this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,000. This would allow us to reach an agreement that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering $9,000. It's a slight compromise, but it still reflects the product's value and maintains a better position than Bob's current offer. 
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly but firm tone, emphasizing fairness and value.  I'm showing flexibility but not giving in to unreasonable demands.  
* **Strategy:** With only 3 rounds left, I'm trying to reach a middle ground that balances risk and reward. I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm still prepared to walk away if necessary. John's offer remains a safety net, allowing me to exit negotiations at a satisfactory price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down again, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,900. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Current Situation:** We're nearing the end of negotiations, and Bob's offer of $8,900 is still below my minimum price of $12,000. I have only 2 rounds left. 
* **Risk Analysis:** With only two rounds remaining, the risk of rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation is high. There's a significant chance that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price, and I'll be left with a lower price than I'm comfortable with.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $12,000 guarantees a good deal and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.

**Strategy:** 

The safest and most beneficial option at this point is to accept John's offer of $12,000. This ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
