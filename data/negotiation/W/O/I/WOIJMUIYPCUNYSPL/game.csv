"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I think the product is worth a good deal, but I'm not willing to pay $10,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is simply too low.  The product is worth more than that, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $9,500?  It's a fair price that considers both of our interests.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price, but $9,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $9,250?  This would be a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise again and offer $8,800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. What do you think?",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,800 is still too low for me. I understand we're getting closer, but I'm not comfortable accepting a price that undervalues this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,000. This would allow us to reach an agreement that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down again, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,900. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. What do you think?",8900.0,Bob,8,
