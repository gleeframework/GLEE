Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $12,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's significantly below my minimum value and doesn't reflect the product's true worth. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $10,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but still holding firm to a value that is more in line with my minimum. I believe this price is reasonable and offers a good potential outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $8,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise, but I'm confident it's a reasonable price for both of us. I believe it's fair, and it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer.  Hopefully, this will be enough to seal the deal."
