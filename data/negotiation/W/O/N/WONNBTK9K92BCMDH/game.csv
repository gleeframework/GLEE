"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about $110? That's a fair compromise, I think.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $130. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
