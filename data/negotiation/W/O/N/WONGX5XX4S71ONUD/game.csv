"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be extremely beneficial to your operations.  I'm confident this price reflects its worth while also leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price is still a great value for you considering the product's worth to your business, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's keep the negotiations moving forward.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer on the price. To be honest, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $1,175,000 doesn't quite get us there. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I think it reflects the value of the product to your business. Let's work towards a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $1,150,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it represents a fair and reasonable price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement.  However, $1,150,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  How about we settle on $1,180,000? It's a reasonable compromise, and it allows us to both move forward.  Let's make this happen.",1180000.0,Alice,7,
