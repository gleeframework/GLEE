{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** $13,000 is closer to my desired value of $15,000 than John's offer of $10,000. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  It's not an unreasonable starting point, giving Bob some space to negotiate without feeling pressured.

I'll be prepared to counter-offer if Bob rejects this initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $12,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is more than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and yours. I'm happy to sell the product for $12,750.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12750} 
```

This counteroffer tries to:

* **Maintain a reasonable profit:** $12,750 is still significantly higher than John's offer, and closer to my desired price.
* **Show flexibility:** By meeting Bob halfway, I demonstrate that I'm open to negotiation while still protecting my interests. 
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  This counteroffer puts the ball back in Bob's court, encouraging him to accept or provide a new counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500, but I'd like to add a small concession to sweeten the deal. Would you be willing to throw in a one-year warranty for the product, and we can meet at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price,  Bob's offer of $12,500 with a one-year warranty is a good deal. The warranty adds value to the product for Bob and secures a sale at a price that's significantly higher than John's offer.  This seems like a win-win."
