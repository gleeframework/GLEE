"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000.  I believe this is still a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a good middle ground for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer of $9,500. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.

"Alice, I understand your position. While $10,250 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference and go with $9,875.  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",9875.0,Bob,6,
