"Hello Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15000 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10000 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $12500?  I'm confident you'll find the product worth that investment.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $11500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not sure if $12000 is the best deal for me. I'd be willing to go up to $11800, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",11800.0,Bob,6,
