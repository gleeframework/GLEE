Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Going for the full $12,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright."
