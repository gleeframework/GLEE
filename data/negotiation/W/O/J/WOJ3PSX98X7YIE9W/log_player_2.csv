"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$6,000 is a great price, but we can likely do better.  We have 10 rounds and no information about Alice's minimum price. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's about 2/3 of Alice's initial offer. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating while still leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,500 is a good deal, we can still try to get a lower price. It's worth another round of negotiation. We have 7 rounds left, and a little more haggling could save us a significant amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, so I'm increasing my bid slightly. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get the best possible price.  We have 6 rounds left, so there's time to see if we can meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied. We have 5 rounds left, and I believe there's more room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get the price down further without risking running out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing that I'm willing to move towards Alice's price.  However, it's still a significant amount lower than her last offer, and I believe there's still room for compromise. With 4 rounds remaining, I'm aiming for a deal that's fair for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now at $5,000, which is within my budget.  While I'd like to get it down a bit more, with only 3 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product, rather than risk ending up paying $15,000 to John."
