Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. My initial price is $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the product's worth and the potential it offers. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and selling to John guarantees my minimum price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but I'm still a bit too far away from my target price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This offer takes into account the value of the product and your budget. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still significantly lower than the $1,500,000 I can get from John. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll maintain my stance and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we're still a bit apart. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop the price to $1,150,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. My counteroffer is $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not high enough to justify the risk of continuing to negotiate.  We are already halfway through the rounds, and selling to John guarantees a much higher price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'm also keeping the option to sell to John at the back of my mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but I need to be closer to my target price to make this work.  My final counteroffer is $1,200,000. I've come down significantly from my initial price, and I believe this is a fair reflection of the product's value and your budget. Let's reach a deal in this round."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```
**Reasoning:**

I've lowered my price significantly, but I'm still above the $1,075,000 Bob is offering. This is my final counteroffer, and it's a compromise. If Bob rejects, I will sell to John. We are running out of time, and I need to secure a sale soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to reach your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've been willing to compromise throughout the negotiation, and I think we're getting close. However, I'm still $100,000 above my budget. My final counteroffer is $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer is still significantly lower than what I can get from John.  We've reached the final rounds of the negotiation, and it's becoming increasingly risky to continue with Bob. The potential gain from another round of negotiation is outweighed by the guaranteed profit of selling to John. I will sell to John to secure a higher price and avoid further uncertainty."
