Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a compromise that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to me and the potential deal with John. I'm hoping Bob will finally see reason and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low. I've made multiple concessions, and he's not showing much willingness to negotiate. At this point, I'm better off selling to John for $1,200,000. It's a guaranteed deal, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on a good profit for a potentially uncertain outcome with Bob."
