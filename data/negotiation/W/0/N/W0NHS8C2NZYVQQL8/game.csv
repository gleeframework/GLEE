"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for the value this product provides.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $9800 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is my final compromise, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10200 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've given it a lot of thought, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,7,
