Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** Starting with a price of $15,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob doesn't accept $15,000, the initial offer opens the door for negotiation. You can always lower the price slightly if needed, moving closer to your minimum of $10,000."
