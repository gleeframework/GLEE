"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $18,000, and I'd like to make a fair deal. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is significantly below its value.  I could consider a price of $15,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $15,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $12,500 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",12500.0,Bob,4,
