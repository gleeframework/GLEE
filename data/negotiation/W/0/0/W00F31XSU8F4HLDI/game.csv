"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you think the initial offer was a bit high, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle again at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $1,200,000, which is actually the same price I initially offered. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're going in circles a bit. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $1,200,000 is simply too high for me.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? It's a fair price that gives you a good profit.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,250,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you say that's your final offer, but I'm finding it hard to meet you there. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's really the absolute best I can do.  If we can't agree here, I might have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I can offer you the product for $1,150,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1150000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is it. I'm willing to offer you $1,100,000 for the product. This is my absolute final offer. If you don't accept this, I'm going to have to walk away and buy from John, even though it's more expensive. I believe this price is fair and allows you to make a good profit. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,10,
