"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This price reflects the significant value you'll be getting, while also allowing me to make a decent return on my investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
