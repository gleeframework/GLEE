"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Showing willingness to negotiate:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation, making it less likely Bob will immediately reject the offer.
* **Asking for his opinion:** I'm engaging Bob and getting him thinking about the value of the product, which could lead to a more productive conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my desired value.  
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $8,000. This provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's still a great price for the value this product offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justifying the price:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to convince Bob to pay a higher price.
* **Open to further discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiations by asking Bob for his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $7,750 is still below my minimum of $8,000. 
* **Negotiations are still possible:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm hopeful I can get a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can still sell to John for $8,000, but I want to maximize my earnings if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $7,750 is still a little below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $8,250, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's find common ground here. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price slightly lower than my minimum, indicating a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and reason.
* **Direct appeal:** I'm asking Bob directly for his opinion to encourage a positive response and keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further gain:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price. It's more likely that Bob will walk away.
* **Time pressure:** With only 4 rounds remaining, it's risky to continue negotiating. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a price that meets my minimum requirements.
* **Equal value for both parties:**  This agreement is a fair compromise, ensuring both Bob and I are satisfied with the outcome."
