Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value than mine.  However, it's still a significant profit above my minimum. I'll counter, but I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't budge enough.
