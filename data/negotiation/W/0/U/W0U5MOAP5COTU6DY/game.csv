"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,700,000 is too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is still a fair price given the value this product will bring to your business.  Let's make this deal happen!",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be honest,  $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could meet you halfway at $1,375,000.  That's a fair compromise. What do you say?",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,375,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $1,400,000 is still just a bit too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
