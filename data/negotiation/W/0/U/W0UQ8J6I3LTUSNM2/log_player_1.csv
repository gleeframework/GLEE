{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** Leaving you room to make concessions if necessary.
* **It's a strong starting point:**  Shows you're serious about selling to him.

If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to go lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'll keep John as a backup option in case Bob doesn't budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $9,000?  That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 9000}
