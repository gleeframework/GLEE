"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than Alice's initial value, Bob can still get the product for cheaper from John.  The next step is to make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $9,000?  That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice when a better deal is already available."
