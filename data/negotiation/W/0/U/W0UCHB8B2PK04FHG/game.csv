"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $920,000 is a fair reflection of that. I'm confident you'll see a considerable return on your investment at this price point. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,
