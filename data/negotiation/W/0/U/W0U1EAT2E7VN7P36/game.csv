"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,800,000? I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. While $2,300,000 represents a fair assessment given its potential, I'm willing to meet you closer to your price point.

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet my budget constraints. However, I would like to propose a price of $1,900,000. This still allows me to recognize the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
