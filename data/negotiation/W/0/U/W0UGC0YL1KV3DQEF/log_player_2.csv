"Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

You can definitely do better than $750,000. You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $700,000.  This gives Alice a decent discount while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  While I'd like to keep negotiating, $720,000 is a good deal and within my budget. It's also closer to what the product is worth to Alice.  I'll accept the offer and avoid risking a longer negotiation that could lead to a higher price or even buying from John."
