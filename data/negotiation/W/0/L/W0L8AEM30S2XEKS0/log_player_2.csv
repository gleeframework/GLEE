"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better price. There are still 9 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $750,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above Alice's minimum value of $800,000. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's price, there is still room for negotiation. Bob has already shown he's willing to negotiate and Alice is clearly interested in making a deal. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation process moving and increases the chances of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $780,000?  It's a significant step closer to your previous offer and  demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal. "", ""product_price"": 780000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a smaller step down than the previous one, showing he's willing to be flexible but not give up too much. $780,000 is still a decent profit for Alice, making this a reasonable counteroffer that could lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to give up on the value of this product. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $815,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $815,000, which is very close to Bob's desired price point. While there's still room for negotiation, it's unlikely Bob will get a better offer from Alice. It's better to secure the product at this price than risk losing the deal entirely and having to buy from John at a higher price."
