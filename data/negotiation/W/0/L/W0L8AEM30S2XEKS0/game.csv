"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $780,000?  It's a significant step closer to your previous offer and  demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal. ",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to give up on the value of this product. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $815,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally find a mutually beneficial agreement.
