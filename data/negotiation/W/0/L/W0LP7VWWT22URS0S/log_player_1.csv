{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price but leaves room for negotiation, as I'm aware that the product is worth $100 to Bob.  It's a good starting point to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $87 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87 is very close to my minimum price of $80, and it's likely that he won't budge further.  It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale than risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower price."
