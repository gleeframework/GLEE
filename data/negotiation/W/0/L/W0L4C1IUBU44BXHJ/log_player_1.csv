"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm still not comfortable going above $130. Would you be willing to meet me at $135?

You have three options:

It's clear that Bob is very unlikely to go above $135.  Since you have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John, it makes the most financial sense to cut off negotiations with Bob and sell to John."
