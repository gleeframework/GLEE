Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below John's offer ($1,150,000) leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" and a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
