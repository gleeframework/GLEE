Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet at $17,000. Would it be possible to consider $15,000 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

This is the best possible outcome for you, Alice. You are getting the maximum value Bob is willing to pay, which matches what John is offering.
