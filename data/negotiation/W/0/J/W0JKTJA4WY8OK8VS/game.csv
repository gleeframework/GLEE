"Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase a product that I believe will be invaluable to your business. My asking price is $900,000, which I know is a fair value considering the product's potential. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay full price. I trust you'll give this serious consideration.",900000.0,Alice,1,
