Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a fallback option with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your $150 minimum.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the price is above Bob's perceived value ($80), it's presented as a ""deal"" since you believe he'll find it valuable. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between enticing Bob while ensuring you don't lose out on a significant profit."
