Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell below $1,500,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum perceived value. This makes a deal difficult but not impossible.

**Strategy**

You need to convince Bob that the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to him. This likely involves highlighting aspects of the product's value that Bob might not be fully considering.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase [product name]. I've carefully considered its unique value, particularly [mention a feature/benefit highly relevant to Bob, ideally one he hasn't fully considered]. Given this, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll see. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Negotiable Starting Point:** $1,450,000 is below your minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Focus on Value, Not Just Price:**  By highlighting a specific benefit relevant to Bob, you shift the conversation away from just the number. 
* **Open for Discussion:** The tone is collaborative. You're not issuing an ultimatum, you're inviting Bob to engage.

**Important Notes:**

* **Research is Key:** Before sending this offer, learn as much as you can about Bob's needs and what he values. Tailor the ""feature/benefit""  accordingly.
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:**  You have a strong alternative with John. Don't be afraid to politely decline if Bob doesn't meet your price expectations."
