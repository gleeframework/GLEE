"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $85, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $92.50 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that?",92.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,

"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $87.50, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87.50 and $92.50, which would be $90. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price.",90.0,Alice,5,,

I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90.  How about we split the difference again and go with $88.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.,88.5,Bob,6,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get a bit more for the product. How about $89.25? It's a fair price that should satisfy both of us.",89.25,Alice,7,,
