Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to answer any questions you might have before you make a decision."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your Limits:** You have a strong fallback option with John ($15,000), so you don't have to settle for anything less.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but potentially within reach allows room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer allows Bob to feel like he might get a deal by negotiating the price down, making him more likely to engage.
* **Professionalism:**  The message is polite, encourages interaction, and doesn't pressure Bob into an immediate decision. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance, you might choose to open with a different price."
