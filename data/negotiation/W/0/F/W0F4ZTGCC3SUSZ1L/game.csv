"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about we meet at $10,750? I think this is a reasonable compromise and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $11,000? This is my absolute bottom line. Let me know if you're able to come up to this price, otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
