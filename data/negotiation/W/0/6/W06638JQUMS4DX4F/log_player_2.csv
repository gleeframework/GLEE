"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $9,500 is below his maximum, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. It's advantageous to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
