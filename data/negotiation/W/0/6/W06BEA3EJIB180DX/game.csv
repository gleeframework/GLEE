"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about $125? That's still a great price for a product worth $120 to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $125 is a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's try to make this work.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $115 still isn't quite enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",120.0,Alice,5,
