Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it will be extremely valuable to you. My initial price is $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think the initial price is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit far off from your price point.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the unique value of this product and its potential benefit for your business.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better. I'll make a counteroffer of $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below the $800,000 I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm not yet at the point where I'd consider selling to John, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob.  There's still a good chance we can come to an agreement within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make a final concession to reach a deal. I'm offering the product for $825,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes both the value of the product and your budget constraints. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept this price, I'll finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  I've already stated that I'm willing to sell to John for that amount.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation further.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum desired price."
