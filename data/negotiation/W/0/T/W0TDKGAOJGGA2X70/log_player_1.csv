""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We're still significantly above our minimum acceptable price. Let's counter-offer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $1,125,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting close, but Bob's offer is still undercutting the potential profit. We have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we finalize the deal at $1,100,000? This price reflects my desire to reach an agreement while ensuring a fair value for the product."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

We are now at a point where we are still making a good profit but showing a willingness to close the deal. This price might be appealing to Bob and end the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could likely push for a bit more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher and we risk losing him as a buyer entirely. Accepting $1,050,000 ensures a significant profit above our $1,000,000 minimum."
