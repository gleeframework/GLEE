Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'll be very interested in. I'm asking $1,500,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,500,000, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I highlight the ""value and potential"" of the product to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message ends with ""Let me know your thoughts,"" indicating I'm open to a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

*  I'll analyze Bob's response.  
* If he accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer. 
* If negotiations stall, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting would be a huge loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he has shown interest in the product. This means there's room for negotiation. 
* **Sell to John as a safety net:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, which provides a backup plan if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  
* I'll carefully consider Bob's potential willingness to pay based on his initial offer and the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  I'm prepared to lower the price to $1,300,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for some flexibility.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within my range:**  $1,300,000 is above my minimum but still leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Emphasize compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a compromise to show good faith and encourage Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Maintain value:** I continue to remind Bob of the product's ""unique value"" to justify the price. 
* **Open to discussion:** I keep the door open for further negotiation with ""Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.""

**Next Steps:**

*  Analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer.
*  If he accepts, I've achieved a good deal.
*  If he rejects, I'll decide whether to accept his next counteroffer, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, I'm not confident that further negotiation will yield a significantly better result. 
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, guaranteeing me a sale that meets my financial goals.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll contact John and finalize the sale of the product for $1,200,000.
* I've secured a good deal while minimizing the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might result in a lower price."
