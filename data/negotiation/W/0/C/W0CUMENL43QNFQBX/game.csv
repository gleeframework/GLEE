"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $120 to me. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is my absolute minimum. Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. I can offer $105 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?,105.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. How about $107? It's a fair compromise, and it's the closest I can go without losing too much.",107.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short. I can offer $106 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",106.0,Bob,6,
