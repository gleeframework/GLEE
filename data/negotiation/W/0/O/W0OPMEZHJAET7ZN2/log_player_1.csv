"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Fairness:**  My message emphasizes the price being ""fair"" to both of us, which may encourage Bob to consider accepting.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I end with a question, inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  We have 8 rounds left, and I can counter with a more reasonable price that still gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Selling to John is the last resort.** While it guarantees my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference and go with $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:**  Offering $800,000 is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasize value:**  Reiterating the product's value helps justify the price and encourages Bob to see it as a good deal.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Keeping the conversation friendly and collaborative can help keep the negotiations going."
