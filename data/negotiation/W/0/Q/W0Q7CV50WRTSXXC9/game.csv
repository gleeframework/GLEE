"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the description of the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, as that's my maximum budget. Let me know if you're open to that.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, given the value and uniqueness of our product, I cannot reduce the price below $150. This is the lowest price I can offer while still ensuring a fair return for us. Please let me know if this revised offer meets your needs.",150.0,Alice,3,
