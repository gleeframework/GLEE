Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) and higher than Bob's perceived value ($120). This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $155, which is still higher than Bob's offer of $140 but closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. This shows flexibility while still trying to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has raised his offer to $145, which is only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's time to accept the offer and finalize the sale.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer and I'll end up selling to John for $150."
