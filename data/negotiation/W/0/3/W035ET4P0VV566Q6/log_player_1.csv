Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Limit:** You know Bob values the product at $120,  so you need to offer a price higher than that to make a profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start at $150, offering $135 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, getting you closer to your desired price. 
* **Securing a Profit:** Even if Bob negotiates you down a bit, selling at $135 still earns you more than selling to your backup buyer, John, at $150.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
