Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $700,000 is within Bob's budget and is a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  While Bob might still prefer a lower price, accepting the offer ensures he gets the product and saves a significant amount of money.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and being forced to buy from John at a much higher price."
