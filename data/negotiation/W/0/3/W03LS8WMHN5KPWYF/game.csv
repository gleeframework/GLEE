"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $180. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a lot of value from the product.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $165?",165.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $165. I'm willing to give you a slight discount and offer it to you for $170. It's a great deal, and I think you'll still get a lot of value from the product.",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to give me a discount, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $160 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $165 is not possible, but $162.50 is?",162.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $162.50 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $167.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a lot of value from the product.",167.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $160 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",160.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still hesitant about the price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $165, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll still get a lot of value from the product.",165.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $160. I'm willing to pay $160 for the product. This is my final offer.",160.0,Bob,10,
