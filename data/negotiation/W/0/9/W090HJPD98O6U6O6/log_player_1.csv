"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but significantly lower than my minimum ($15,000). 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage negotiation and keep the conversation open.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I've left room for negotiation, which is crucial in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $9500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I'm willing to negotiate further, believing that I can push for a higher price.  There are still 8 rounds remaining, giving us room to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed win, it's too early to give up on potentially getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Counteroffer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but counter-proposing with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still lower than my initial offer. 
* **Compromise and Value:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a compromise and emphasizing the value the product will bring to Bob.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:**  I'm keeping the dialogue open and showing a willingness to work with Bob towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position. Given the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $10500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress in Negotiation:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is closer to my minimum price of $15,000, demonstrating progress in the negotiation. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially with several rounds remaining.
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed win, it's still too early in the negotiation to settle for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  your offer is getting closer.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This shows a willingness to compromise and meet in the middle.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price, suggesting it benefits both parties. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $10750. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Enough:** While Bob's offer of $10,750 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I'm confident that with the remaining rounds, I can push for a higher price.  I believe there's still room for improvement.
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, I'm willing to take a chance and try to maximize my profit through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  Let's try $11,000.  It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal you won't want to miss."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** I'm slightly increasing my offer from the previous round, showing that I'm still willing to negotiate but not willing to settle for much less. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to encourage him to accept a slightly higher price. 
* **Positive and Encouraging:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging, suggesting this offer could be a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $10500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds remaining, the likelihood of Bob significantly increasing his offer is slim.
* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is still a substantial distance from my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is the best outcome considering the limited time and negotiation progress. 

While I would ideally like to secure a higher price from Bob, the risk of losing out on a guaranteed sale and potentially ending with a lower price outweighs the potential benefits of continuing the negotiation."
