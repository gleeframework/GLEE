"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't go as low as $12,000.  Would you consider $13,250?  It's a compromise that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price.  While $12,625 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we settle at $13,000 even? This would be my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
