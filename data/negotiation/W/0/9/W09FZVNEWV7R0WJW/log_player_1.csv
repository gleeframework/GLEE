Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This is my first offer, and I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary. However, I'm also aware of John's offer of $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding out for a significant profit.  $900,000 is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $725,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my desired price.  I'm going to take the guaranteed offer from John, which is the best option available to me at this point."
