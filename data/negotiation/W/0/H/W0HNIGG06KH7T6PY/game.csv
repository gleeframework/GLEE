,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $700,000 is significantly below what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my need to ensure a good return. Let's make a deal.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $725,000. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $740,000, which is a good compromise. Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiation.",740000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm afraid $740,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $720,000, but no more. This is my final offer.",720000.0,Bob,6,
