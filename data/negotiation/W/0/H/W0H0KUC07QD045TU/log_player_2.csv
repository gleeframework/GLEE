"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $13,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum budget:** $13,500 is less than Bob's $15,000 limit.
* **Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer:** She's come down from $14,000 to $13,500, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price:**  It's likely that any further counteroffers would be minor, and the risk of Alice rejecting and Bob ultimately having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential for a small additional discount."
