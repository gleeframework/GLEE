"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a discounted price of $12,000. This represents a significant savings for you and allows me to move it quickly. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'm interested, but I would only be able to go as high as $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $9,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to sell to John for $15,000, Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable threshold. It's better to secure a sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer or even no offer at all."
