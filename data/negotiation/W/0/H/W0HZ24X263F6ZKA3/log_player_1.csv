Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $145. I think it would be very valuable to you, but I'm happy to consider a reasonable counter-offer if you have one."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John acts as a safety net, offering the product below $150 to Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and a deal struck anywhere above $150 would be more profitable than selling directly to John.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** The message doesn't reveal the absolute bottom price. The mention of ""reasonable counter-offer"" encourages Bob to engage without completely revealing Alice's position.

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while still guaranteeing a sale at a minimum acceptable price."
