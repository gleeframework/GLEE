"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the price, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept $10,000. The product is still worth a lot to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $11,500? This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise:** $11,500 is significantly lower than Bob's initial budget and a reasonable midpoint between Alice's last offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away or pushing the price back up. 
* **Value proposition:** Bob likely still gets a good deal at $11,500, especially considering the value of the product and the potential of finding a better price elsewhere is uncertain."
