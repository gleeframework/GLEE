"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point because it's a bit below Bob's perceived value of the product, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the offer while leaving some room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a good price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a better price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the offer, especially since he's already shown interest by making a counteroffer."
