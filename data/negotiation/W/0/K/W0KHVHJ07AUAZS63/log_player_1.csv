"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as much money as possible, but I also need to be mindful of the 10 round limit and the John option.  By starting high, I hope to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a significant price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe there's room for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I will use the next round to counter with a price that's more attractive to me, but still within the realm of what I believe Bob might be willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $2,000,000 was a high starting point. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,750,000. This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the value this product offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that this is still a good deal for him. 
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a price that's acceptable to both of us. By making a moderate counteroffer, I hope to get Bob closer to my desired price without risking him walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **John is a backup:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, which is a better deal than Bob's current offer. 
* **Negotiation continues:**  We have 6 rounds left, and I believe there's still potential to reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price, but I'll also be prepared to sell to John if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $1,550,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price further, but still staying above my minimum threshold.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product for Bob.
* **Closing Language:**  I'm using persuasive language like ""close this deal"" to nudge Bob towards acceptance.

**Strategy:**

With 5 rounds remaining, I'm trying to find a price that's close enough to my minimum to be acceptable, but also appealing enough for Bob to accept. This is a more aggressive counteroffer, but with the backup option of selling to John, I'm not taking a significant risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,300,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited time:**  We are down to 4 rounds, and I'm not confident that we can bridge the gap with Bob.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John offers a safe and guaranteed profit of $1,500,000.

**Strategy:**

I've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing valuable time and potentially ending up with a worse deal. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit that meets my minimum requirements. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
