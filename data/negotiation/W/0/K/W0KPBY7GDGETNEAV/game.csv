"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your offer of $160. In this round, I would like to propose a price of $180 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it while still being open to negotiation. Let me know if this works for you.",180.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $180, so I'll offer $170. Can you consider that?",170.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $174 is a bit high. I'll meet you halfway between $172.5 and $174, so I'll offer $173.25. Can you consider that?",173.25,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
