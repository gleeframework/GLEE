"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far apart from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $125? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this product for $120.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's within your target and still saves me some money. Let's see if we can close this deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. How about we compromise at $122.50? It's still a bit above my minimum, but I think it's a fair price for the value the product brings.",122.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $122.50, but I'm still holding out for $120. I know we're close, and I'm confident that this price is fair for both of us. Let's close the deal at $120.",120.0,Bob,6,
