"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000.

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe my initial offer is closer to the true value of the product. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet halfway at $1,000,000? This allows both of us to benefit.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
