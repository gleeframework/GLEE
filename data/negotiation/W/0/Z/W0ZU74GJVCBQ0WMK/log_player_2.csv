"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher than the product's value to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to find a price point that's closer to the product's value to Alice while still leaving room for negotiation.  A counteroffer of $900,000 represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and is likely to encourage her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial proposal, it's still a bit too high. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to the product's value to Alice ($800,000).  There are still 7 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample opportunity to find a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a slightly more aggressive approach this round. He's increasing his counteroffer from $900,000 to $950,000. This shows Alice that he's serious about getting a deal, but also that he's willing to compromise. This strategy aims to find a middle ground between Bob's desired price and Alice's likely minimum."
