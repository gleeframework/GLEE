"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's definitely worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer.  Alice might reject it, but it sets the stage for further negotiation. I'm aiming for a significant discount, but I'm still within a range that's likely appealing to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down a bit, but I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about making a deal, but still aiming for a price lower than Alice's offer.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, and we're halfway through the negotiation. I'm comfortable accepting this offer, as it saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might yield a better price, but the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer or running out of rounds is too high."
