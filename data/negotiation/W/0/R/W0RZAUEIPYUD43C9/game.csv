,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  While $6,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm getting closer to your price range, but $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,250 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,000. This price reflects the value of the product and would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
