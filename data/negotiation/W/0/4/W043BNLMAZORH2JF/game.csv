"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can go from there.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That initial price is a bit high for me, but I do see the value. How about we bring it down closer to the $1,000,000 mark?  I'd be willing to start at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and recognizing the product's value. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,900,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,900,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  I'm willing to move up to $1,300,000. Let me know if that works for you.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer.  To be honest, taking anything less than $1,650,000 would mean selling at a significant loss. This is my best and final offer, as I know this product will greatly benefit your business. ",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your best offer, but that price point just doesn't make sense for me right now.  If you're willing to reconsider and come down to $1,400,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
