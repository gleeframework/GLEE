Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That initial price is a bit high for me, but I do see the value. How about we bring it down closer to the $1,000,000 mark?  I'd be willing to start at $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
