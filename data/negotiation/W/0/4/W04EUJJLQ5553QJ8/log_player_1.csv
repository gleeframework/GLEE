{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $10,000 to you and I'm confident you'll get good value out of it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, keeping John's $10,000 offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll aim for a price that's still a good value for Bob, but closer to the $12,000 I'd like to get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $9,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. Accepting this offer is the best option to ensure a sale and a decent profit."
