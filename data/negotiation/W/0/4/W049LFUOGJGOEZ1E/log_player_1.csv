"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $15000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While I could try to negotiate further with Bob, it's unlikely I'll get a higher price. He's already offered my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John would net me the same amount. Accepting Bob's offer ensures the deal is closed quickly, minimizing the risk of losing out to another potential buyer."
