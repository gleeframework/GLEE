"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I believe it's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $6,000 is significantly lower than the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still represents a great deal for you considering the product's potential.  Let's meet in the middle. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle on $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $7,500 is still below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the limited time we have left.  Let's finalize this deal and make it happen.",8000.0,Alice,5,
