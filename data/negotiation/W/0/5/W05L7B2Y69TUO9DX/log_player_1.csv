"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and go with $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $105 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not there yet. I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $105 is still a little too low. How about $108? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  "", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $108. I'm willing to go up to $106, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $106 isn't my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me, and I'm running out of rounds. There's always a risk of getting stuck with a lower price from John if I keep rejecting Bob."
