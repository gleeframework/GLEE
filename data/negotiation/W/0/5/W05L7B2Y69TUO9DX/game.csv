"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and go with $105. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $105 is still a little too low. How about $108? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  ",108.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $108. I'm willing to go up to $106, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",106.0,Bob,6,
