Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value,  $950000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $800000, which is the maximum I can offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the product's value. Let's work together to reach an agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
