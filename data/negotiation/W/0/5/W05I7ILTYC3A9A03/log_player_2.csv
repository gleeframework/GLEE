Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Let's try to find a sweet spot. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is my best and final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above what John is offering. You can get the product for $50,000 less by going with John. There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and you risk her sticking to her ""final offer"".  It makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
