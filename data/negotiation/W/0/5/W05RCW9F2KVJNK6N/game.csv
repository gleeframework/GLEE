"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go all the way up to $200. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $200 is already a very competitive price for this product. How about we meet halfway at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",140.0,Bob,4,
