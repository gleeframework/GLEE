"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you would make it a worthwhile investment.  I'm asking for $1,150,000.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  I believe this price still offers significant value for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is closer but still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference at $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I want to go up to $1,075,000. How about we meet at $1,025,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget.  $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I want to be fair.  Let's meet at $1,050,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from this product while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,037,500? I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1037500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your compromise.  $1,037,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $1,045,000.  This price reflects the value this product brings to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1045000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $1,045,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,030,000. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1,200,000.",1030000.0,Bob,10,
