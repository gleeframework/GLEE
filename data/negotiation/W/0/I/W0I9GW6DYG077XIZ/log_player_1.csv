Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more and I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $11,000. I'm willing to compromise, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference and meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I still need to save some money. Can we meet somewhere in the middle, like $10,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my target price, $10,200 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000."
