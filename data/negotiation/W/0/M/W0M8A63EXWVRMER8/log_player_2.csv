"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You can get the product for $1,100,000 from Alice, which is less than the $1,200,000 you'd pay John.
* **You're still saving money.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and you're getting it for $1,100,000."
