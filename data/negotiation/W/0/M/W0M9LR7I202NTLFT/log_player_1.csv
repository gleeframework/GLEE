"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is closer to my minimum than his initial offer, I can still potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $13000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $13,000 is a good compromise and a decent profit for me.  It's better than risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
