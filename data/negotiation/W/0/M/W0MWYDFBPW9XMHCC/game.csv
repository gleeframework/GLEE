,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value it offers, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to make a profit. I can meet you halfway, but I need to charge at least $160 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $140 as a compromise?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $145. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",145.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession. I'll meet you at $142.50, but that's as low as I can go.",142.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose $140 as the final offer.",140.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll sell the product to you for $142, but that's as low as I can go. After this, I'll have to consider other offers.",142.0,Alice,9,
