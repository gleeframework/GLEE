Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $150.  I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you come down in price later. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""limited time"" and ""special price,"" we create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept or counter quickly.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows us to gauge Bob's interest level and his potential counter-offer range. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly less than our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.  We have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. 

Let's see if we can get Bob closer to $120 without losing him entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  By suggesting $130, we're signaling a willingness to negotiate while still staying above our minimum price and closer to our initial offer. This approach often feels fair to both parties and can facilitate a quicker agreement.
* **Highlighting Value:**  We're subtly reiterating the product's value to encourage Bob to stretch his budget.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** We're leaving some room for further negotiation if Bob counters again, potentially reaching a price point between $120 and $130."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $110 is still below our minimum acceptable price of $120. While we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Bob will reach our desired price. John's standing offer provides a guaranteed $120, making it the most logical choice in this scenario. 

It's important to recognize when to walk away from a negotiation and capitalize on a guaranteed offer that meets our minimum requirements."
