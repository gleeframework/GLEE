Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $120 is above your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit. 
* **Reasonable for Bob:** $120 is significantly less than the value Bob places on the product ($150). It gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.

By starting with this offer, you create the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement and avoid immediately going to your fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can only pay $100 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is more than your minimum of $80, it's still lower than the $120 you initially offered. You believe there's room to negotiate closer to your initial price, so rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a little more. How about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
This counteroffer:

* **Is still higher than your minimum:** $110 is above your minimum selling price of $80, so you're still making a profit.
* **Shows flexibility:** It's a compromise from your initial $120 offer.
* **Highlights the value for Bob:** It emphasizes that $110 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $105 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While you initially wanted more, Bob's offer of $105 is still a significant profit for you and is above your minimum of $80.  It's important to recognize that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, and you could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures you get a good price while also closing the deal."
