"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fantastic value.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
