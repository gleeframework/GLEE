{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and positive tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price further. 

This strategy balances maximizing my potential profit with keeping the negotiation open and engaging. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response and my willingness to close the deal rather than sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $9000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than his initial rejection, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation.  I can likely secure a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding the ""Sure Loss"":**  Selling to John for $15,000 is my guaranteed outcome.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the possibility of a better deal alive.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my ideal point, but still below my minimum,  showing flexibility while maintaining my negotiation position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit more.  How about $10,500?  This price still reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm countering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiation position.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and encouraging tone can help keep the negotiation going.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, justifying my price point.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm signaling that I'm open to further discussion and compromise.

This counteroffer balances maintaining my desired profit margin with the potential for a successful negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price that is both acceptable to Bob and profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to offer $9800 for the product. Can you meet me halfway and consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** While Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and has been willing to increase his offer.  It's likely that he's willing to go a bit higher if I push back.
* **Avoiding a ""Good Enough"" Deal:**  While $9,800 is a decent amount of money, I'm aiming for a much better deal. Selling to John for $15,000 is my safety net, but I don't want to settle for less if I can get more.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a final counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $11,000.  I'll be firm but also emphasize the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll finally accept his offer to avoid further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal. I'm willing to go down to $11,000 for this product, but that's my final offer. This price reflects the value of the product and is fair for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:**  I'm setting this as my final counteroffer. This shows determination while still being open to negotiation.
* **Compromise but Firm:**  The price of $11,000 is a compromise, but it's closer to my desired profit margin. 
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's make this happen!"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.

**Outcome:**

If Bob rejects this final offer, I will accept his previous offer of $9,800. While this is still below my minimum, it's the best I can do at this point without risking losing the sale entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $9500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has made his final offer, and while it's still below my ideal price, it's very close to his previous offer and the negotiation seems to have stalled. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  There's a real risk that Bob will walk away if I reject his offer.  Furthermore, continuing to counteroffer might alienate him and damage the potential for future business.
* **Secure a Sale:**  $9,500 is still a significant amount of money and a decent return considering the value of the product to me. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's final offer is the most practical decision. It guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
