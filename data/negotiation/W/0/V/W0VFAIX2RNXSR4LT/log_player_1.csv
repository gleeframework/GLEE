Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant amount above your minimum, giving Bob room to negotiate, but still leaves a substantial profit margin for you. 

It's important to consider the following:

* **Bob's perceived value:** You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so you can likely get closer to that number. 
* **Your risk tolerance:** Are you willing to risk losing the sale to John for a higher price?  
* **Negotiation strategy:**  This offer positions you to potentially get a higher price, but it could lead to a protracted negotiation.  

Let me know if you'd like to explore other options or strategies!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to him and what you're aiming for. You've already established a higher starting point, and rejecting his offer shows you're not willing to settle for a low price. This sets the stage for a counteroffer, which you can use to try and close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise: it's higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate, but still significantly lower than your initial offer, showing you're not ready to accept his price just yet.  This approach aims to reach a middle ground and potentially close the deal without risking losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant profit for you, and you're close to your desired price.  There's a risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or even a breakdown in negotiations, potentially forcing you to sell to John for less. Accepting this offer secures a solid profit and minimizes the risk of losing the sale."
