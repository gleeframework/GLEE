"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to pay $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. I can do $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I still need to make a decent profit on this deal. I can do $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close.  $10,250 is still a little too high for me.  How about we settle on $9,875?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",9875.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,875. I can do $10,000, but I'm starting to think we might be getting too close to the end of the negotiation. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're both trying to be reasonable.  How about we split the difference one last time and settle on $9,900?  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd really like to avoid buying from John.",9900.0,Bob,10,
