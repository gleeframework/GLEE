"I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of a price of $13500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great value for the product's benefits. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $13000, but I'm not going any higher than that. Can you consider this price?",13000.0,Bob,6,
