"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly below the midpoint between my minimum and Bob's estimated value ($10,000 and $12,000 respectively). This leaves room for negotiation and suggests that I am serious about a good price.
* **Positive tone:** I want to create a positive rapport with Bob to make him more likely to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A $11,500 offer gives me room to lower the price in future rounds, while still ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By not starting at a price close to my minimum, I am inviting counteroffers and giving Bob a feeling of control in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for better deal:** While I can sell to John for $10,000, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a better price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation.

In the next round, I will counter with a price that is still above my minimum, but lower than my initial offer. This strategy aims to meet Bob halfway while ensuring I still make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm offering a price that's significantly closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining value:** $10,500 is still a good profit for me and closer to my ideal price.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to increase his desire to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Time is running out:** We are already in round 4, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. 
* **Opportunity cost:** Accepting Bob's offer means securing a profit of $250, which is better than selling to John for $10,000. 

Although I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's important to be pragmatic. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
