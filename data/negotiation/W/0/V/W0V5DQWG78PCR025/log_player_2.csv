Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $900,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice seems unlikely to budge below $900,000, and while we *might* be able to negotiate her down a bit more, it's not worth the risk.  We can get the product for $800,000 from John with no further hassle."
