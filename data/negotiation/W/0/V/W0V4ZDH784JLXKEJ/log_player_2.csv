"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's important to start negotiating and see if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer will allow you to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $2,300,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is a significant amount considering my maximum budget. I'm open to discussing further but need to stay within this range."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're opening with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price, but still higher than our maximum willingness to pay. This shows we're serious about buying but also need a good deal.
* **Justification:**  We provide a reason for the offer, focusing on our budget constraint. 
* **Openness:**  We express willingness to negotiate, but emphasize the need to stay within the proposed range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,950,000. This offer reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest. I'm eager to move forward and believe this price point can benefit us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.  The goal is to get closer to Bob's budget without jeopardizing the deal completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,950,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're showing a willingness to compromise by raising our offer significantly from the previous round. 
* **Focus on Bridging the Gap:** We frame our counteroffer as an attempt to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Confidence:** We express confidence that a deal can be reached,  keeping the negotiation positive."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of this product while remaining within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

* **Progress:** We acknowledge Alice's compromise and highlight that we're making progress.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate how much effort you've put into this negotiation, and I want to see us reach an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, but this is my final offer.  It's a fantastic price for a product of this caliber.  What do you say, shall we make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Final Offer:** Alice has declared this as her final offer, leaving little room for further negotiation.
* **Above Budget:** $1,450,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate risks wasting valuable time and potentially missing out on the guaranteed deal with John.

At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. While he might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price from Alice, the risk of a failed negotiation outweighs the potential savings."
