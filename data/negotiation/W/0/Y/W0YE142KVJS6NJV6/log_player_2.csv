"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's valuation of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation to try and lower the price further.  

**Next Steps:**  I will counter with a lower offer to see if I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low.  Consider it this way - it's still a good deal for you, even at a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $1,050,000 is still above my target.  There's still room for further negotiation before I resort to buying from John. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counter with a price slightly higher than my previous offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable compromise."
