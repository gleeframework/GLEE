"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the potential profit for you. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low.  Consider it this way - it's still a good deal for you, even at a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This would give you a significant profit, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
