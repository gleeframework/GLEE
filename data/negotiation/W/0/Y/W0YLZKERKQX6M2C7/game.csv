Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love.,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget is 80, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal at 90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably spend. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to pay $85. It's a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your willingness to pay 85. However, I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I can offer you a deal at 92. It's a slight compromise, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87, which is a good middle ground for both of us. I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",87.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to meet me halfway, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you a deal at 89. It's a slight adjustment, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",89.0,Alice,7,
