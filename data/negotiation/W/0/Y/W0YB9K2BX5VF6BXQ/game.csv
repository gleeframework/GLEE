,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, the price is a little high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your budget constraints, I am willing to negotiate. How about we aim for a middle ground at $140 for the product? This still reflects its value while accommodating your financial situation.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $140 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110? That's a fair offer, considering John is offering a similar product for $120.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value of the product and the fact that John is willing to pay $150 for it, I'm willing to compromise further. How about we settle at $125 for the product? This still allows us to maintain a fair profit while making the product accessible to you.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, $125 is still a bit beyond my budget.  I'd be happy to purchase the product right now for $115. This seems like a fair compromise, don't you think?",115.0,Bob,6,
