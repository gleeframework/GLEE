"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm going to need to come in lower than $1200000.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $1000000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value and my initial offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. I believe this is a fair price that still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still too high for me at this point. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1050000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
