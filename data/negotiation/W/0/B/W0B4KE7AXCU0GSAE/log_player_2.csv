Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential return on investment.

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000 vs. $1,500,000). This suggests she has room to negotiate. It's always better to try and get a better price, especially in the early rounds."

We're nearing the end of the negotiations and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. While her offer is still higher than my last counteroffer, it's only $10,000 more.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer, and it avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially falling apart.  It's a good deal for both of us."
