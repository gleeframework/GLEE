"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $680000. I've done some research and I believe this product is worth less than what you're asking. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you say?",680000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $680000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $725000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my minimum threshold.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your offer of $725000. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $690000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you say?",690000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $720000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $715000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",715000.0,Alice,5,
