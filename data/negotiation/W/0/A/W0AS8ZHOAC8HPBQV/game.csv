"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'll counteroffer at $825000. This is my final offer for now.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $825000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $775000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $810000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement.",810000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $810000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think $795000 is the most I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",795000.0,Bob,6,
