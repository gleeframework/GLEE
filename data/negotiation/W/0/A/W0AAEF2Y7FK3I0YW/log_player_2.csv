"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you! My asking price is $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. $9,500 is too high for Bob's budget, and there's potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  Let's make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $8,750.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue negotiating.  While $8,750 is closer to his ideal price, there's still room to lower it a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $8,750, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget. How about $8,600? I think that's a fair compromise and allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,600 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'd need to come down a little further to $8,650 to make it work.  This is a fair price, and it allows us to both get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At this point, Alice has come down to $8,650, which is only $650 more than what Bob could buy it for from John. It's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate further, and it's worth locking in the deal before he risks losing it completely."
