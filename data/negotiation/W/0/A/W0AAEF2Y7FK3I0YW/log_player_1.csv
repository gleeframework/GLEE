"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you! My asking price is $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $10,000 to Alice, and Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly lower than that. It's best to reject the offer and see if Bob is willing to increase his bid in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still holding out for a better price. Even though John offers $10,000, Alice is likely hoping Bob will increase his offer closer to her desired price point.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open for a potential win-win."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $8,750.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $8,750, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget. How about $8,600? I think that's a fair compromise and allows both of us to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still aiming for a higher price and is willing to keep negotiating.  She's hoping Bob will increase his offer just a bit more.  While John offers $10,000, Alice sees the potential for a slightly better deal with Bob if she continues negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,600 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'd need to come down a little further to $8,650 to make it work.  This is a fair price, and it allows us to both get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8650}
