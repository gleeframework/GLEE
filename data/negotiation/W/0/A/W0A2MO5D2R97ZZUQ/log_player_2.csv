# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique and valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a steal of a deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Since you are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering it for $120, it makes sense to accept the offer. You're not saving any money, but you're getting the product at your maximum price point."
