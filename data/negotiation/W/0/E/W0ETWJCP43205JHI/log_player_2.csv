"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  I'm willing to sell it for $1,250,000. This is a significant value proposition, as I could easily sell it to another buyer for $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice's offer is a good deal. While her messaging about its worth to you is irrelevant, the fact that she's willing to sell it for less than your maximum price and less than John's price means you save money by accepting."
