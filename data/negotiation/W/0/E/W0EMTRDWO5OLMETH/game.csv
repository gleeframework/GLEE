"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $9500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $9500 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $7000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $7000. How about we meet in the middle at $8200? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8200 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $7000. How about we settle at $7500? That seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going below $8000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8100? It's a small step back from my original price, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
