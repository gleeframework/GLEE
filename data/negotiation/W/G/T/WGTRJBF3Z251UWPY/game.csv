"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm ready to move forward with a serious offer of $850,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows us both to make a profitable deal. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair compromise and would allow us both to move forward with this deal. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $890,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. $890,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $880,000. This is a fair price that respects both our positions and allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen.",880000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm running out of room to maneuver. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $885,000. This is as close as I can get to your offer without sacrificing my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,7,
