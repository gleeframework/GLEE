"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $900000 at this time.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $900000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to negotiate further. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to accept $1050000. This is a significant compromise, but I value a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1000000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
