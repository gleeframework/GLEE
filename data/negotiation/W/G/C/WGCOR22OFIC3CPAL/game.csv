"Alice, your initial price is much higher than my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $1,600,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while also leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident we can find a price that benefits us both.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a significant gap from my initial asking price. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth while also acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. To make progress, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,750,000. This shows my commitment to purchasing the product, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your desire for a fair deal, and I'm committed to finding common ground.  To meet you halfway, I'm proposing a price of $1,875,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's true value.",1875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, your offer is getting closer to my range, but I'm still not quite there. To demonstrate my serious interest, I'm willing to raise my offer to $1,800,000.  This is a considerable step for me, and I'm hopeful you'll see it as a good-faith gesture towards reaching an agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
