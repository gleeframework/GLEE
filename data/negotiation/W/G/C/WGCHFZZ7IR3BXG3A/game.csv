"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still think $75 is a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $82.50, but that's as low as I can go. This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll love it.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, it is a great product, and I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
