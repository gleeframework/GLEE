{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. I'm confident it's worth a significant investment for you, and I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I have 9 rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000, reflecting the potential value this product holds for you. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1120000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,120,000 is very close to my previous offer of $1,125,000. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price (above my minimum) and secures the sale.  With only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
