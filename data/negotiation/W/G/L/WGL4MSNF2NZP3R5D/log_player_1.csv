Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down even slightly.
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is an option, briefly mentioning the product's value can make the offer seem more reasonable and encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By asking ""What do you think?"" you invite Bob to counter-offer and start a negotiation, increasing your chances of getting a price closer to your ideal outcome.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know the product's worth to Bob, he might not be as aware or willing to pay the full price. 
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate. If Bob rejects the initial offer, be ready to lower the price strategically. However, never go below your minimum of $8,000, as you have a guaranteed buyer in John."
