"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is less than Bob's maximum, he can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in making a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Compromise:**  Bob is offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still a price he's willing to pay. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter back with a slightly higher price, but also signals Bob's serious interest in buying. 
* **Staying Below Maximum:** $95 is still below Bob's maximum of $120, ensuring he gets a good deal if the negotiation is successful."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $105. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress But Still Room:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but $105 is still a bit too high.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price.  He's already shown a willingness to compromise, so Alice may be more willing to negotiate further.
* **Avoiding Overpaying:** Buying from John for $120 is still an option, but Bob wants to maximize his savings if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to go to $100 for the product.  Let's see if we can close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob is only asking for a $5 reduction, showing that he is getting closer to accepting a price.
* **Clear Signal:**  This counteroffer clearly shows that Bob is very close to his limit but is still willing to negotiate. 
* **Final Push:**  This could be the last counteroffer before Bob resorts to buying from John.  The pressure is on Alice to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go below $105. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $102.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $102.5 is very close to Bob's desired price of $100.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Further negotiation risks pushing the price up or wasting rounds.  Alice has shown a willingness to budge, so it's likely she won't go much lower.
* **Good Deal:**  This deal saves Bob $17.50 compared to buying from John, making it a good value.  

While Bob might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of a deal falling through and having to buy from John outweighs the potential savings."
