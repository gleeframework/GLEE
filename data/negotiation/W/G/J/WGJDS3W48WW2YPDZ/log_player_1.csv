"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum selling price.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this reflects its worth while still offering you a fair deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the price you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $900,000, so I'll offer $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $850,000 is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. We're getting closer, and I'm willing to push a bit further before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. You clearly recognize the value of this product.  Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $875,000, so I'll offer $862,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is very consistently sticking to his negotiation strategy and slowly inching up the price. While I could push for more, accepting at $862,500 is a good deal and avoids the risk of him completely walking away."
