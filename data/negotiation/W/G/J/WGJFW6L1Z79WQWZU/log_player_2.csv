"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you're looking to save as much money as possible, it's always worth exploring negotiation first. There's no guarantee Alice will come down in price, but there's also no harm in trying.  You can make a counteroffer and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me for this product. However, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value this product offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down in price considerably, and $13,000 is still within your budget and a good deal compared to John's price. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the product to another buyer."
