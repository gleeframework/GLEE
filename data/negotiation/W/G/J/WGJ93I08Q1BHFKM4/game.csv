"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let's start our negotiation here, and see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 to start. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,000,000 is a fair starting point, it's a bit below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my range. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,075,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I can tell we're both motivated to make this work.  How about $1,100,000? I'm willing to be firm on this offer as it's a significant investment for me.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're making good points.  I'm willing to come down to $1,110,000. This price still ensures a fair return for me, and it's closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can make this happen.  What do you say?",1110000.0,Alice,7,
