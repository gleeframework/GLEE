"Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, considering its value to me.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us to both benefit from this transaction. Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to get a reasonable price for this product. $12,000 is my absolute bottom line - I'm essentially taking a loss at that price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
