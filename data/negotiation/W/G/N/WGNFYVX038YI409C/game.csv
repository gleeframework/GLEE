"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think this is a great price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a great starting point, but I'm not sure I can justify $12000 at this point. I'm very interested in the product, but I'd need to see it at a lower price to make it work for me.  How about $9000?  This reflects my budget and the value I'm placing on the item right now.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a great price considering the product's value and rarity, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable right now.  I'm really interested in this product, and I think $10000 would be a good compromise that reflects both our needs.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already come down from my initial price of $12000, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
