"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high offer, close to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make the price seem more palatable.
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a win-win scenario.

**Important Note:**  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come close to my minimum. This keeps the pressure on Bob and ensures I don't settle for too low a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is Key:** I want to see if I can push Bob higher with a counteroffer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counter with a slightly lower price, but still well above Bob's offer, to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $850,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $925,000 for the product. This is still a fair price for the value it brings you, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. "", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my previous offer.
* **Fair Price:** I'm highlighting that the counteroffer is still beneficial to Bob.
* **Emphasis on Satisfaction:** I'm framing the negotiation as a way for both of us to achieve a positive outcome.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move. It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not desperate to sell at his low offer. It also leaves room for further negotiations in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement, and it's within my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has moved slightly, $875,000 is still well below my minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I believe there's still room for improvement and I'm willing to continue the negotiation process.
* **John as a safety net:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $875,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This price acknowledges your financial constraints while still allowing me to get closer to the value I'm seeking.  Let's reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my offer again, but only by a small amount.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $890,000 for the product. This is a very fair price, and it's the best I can offer. Let's close this deal now, it's in both of our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $890,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I'm not ready to settle for a price that is not significantly closer to my minimum.  I believe there's still room for improvement and I'm willing to continue the negotiation process.
* **John as a safety net:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer.

**Next Steps:**  I will counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but still well above Bob's current offer.  This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also protecting my minimum price. I'm hoping that by continuing to show flexibility while also being firm on my minimum, I can convince Bob to increase his offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we are getting closer.  However, $890,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'll accept $900,000.
