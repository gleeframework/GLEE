"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $850,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $925,000 for the product. This is still a fair price for the value it brings you, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. ",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement, and it's within my budget. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $875,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This price acknowledges your financial constraints while still allowing me to get closer to the value I'm seeking.  Let's reach an agreement that benefits us both.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $890,000 for the product. This is a very fair price, and it's the best I can offer. Let's close this deal now, it's in both of our interests.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we are getting closer.  However, $890,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'll accept $900,000. This shows that I'm committed to closing this deal, but it also allows me to receive a fair price for the product.  Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,7,
