"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,050,000?  This allows for a comfortable margin for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it reflects a good deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 still falls short of what I need. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a final offer from me. If we can't agree on this, I will have to explore other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
