Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,050,000?  This allows for a comfortable margin for both of us.

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price that's not significantly better than your alternative. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she's being genuine about her ""final offer.""  At this point, the potential savings of $25,000 by haggling with Alice aren't worth the risk of losing the product or ending up in a protracted negotiation. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your maximum desired price."
