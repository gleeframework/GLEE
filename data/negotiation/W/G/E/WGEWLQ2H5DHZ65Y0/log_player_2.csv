"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. It's a compromise that should be more comfortable for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his maximum limit of $12,000. There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should continue trying to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget than previous offers, it's still above his maximum limit of $12,000. He should try to negotiate further with Alice, keeping in mind the possibility of buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $14,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $13,000. This represents a significant compromise for me and I believe is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  John is offering the product for $12,000, which is within Bob's budget and the best option at this point."
