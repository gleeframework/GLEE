"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. It's a compromise that should be more comfortable for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $14,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $13,000. This represents a significant compromise for me and I believe is a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",13500.0,Alice,7,
