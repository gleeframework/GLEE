"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I think the product's value justifies a slightly higher price. I'm willing to consider $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a fair price considering its worth to me, and I think it's a good deal for you as well.",12000.0,Alice,5,
