"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position, and hopefully, it will encourage Bob to negotiate seriously.  If he rejects, I'll have to analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and the fact that I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise.  It's worth exploring if I can get a better price before I sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price that is fair to me.  I hope this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating.  I have a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price than this.  I don't want to rush into selling to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counteroffering again with $1,600,000.  I'm making a smaller adjustment this time, showing that I'm serious about reaching a deal.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise while still getting a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have a few rounds left, and I'm determined to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and try to get him up to my minimum with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,550,000.  I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still have room to negotiate. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope Bob will recognize that I'm serious about closing this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price.  I don't want to risk ending up with less than I'm comfortable with.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John. While I would have loved to get more from Bob,  $1,500,000 is a fair and secure outcome for me."
