"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120.  This is a good deal, but you can potentially save more money by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $100?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $110 is a good deal.  It's still below your maximum price of $150 and a decent compromise.  You can save $40 compared to buying from John."
