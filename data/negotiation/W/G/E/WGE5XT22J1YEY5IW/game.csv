"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. While I'm interested,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? I'm confident we can both walk away happy with that price.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,750 just yet. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other options. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
