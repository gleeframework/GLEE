"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider purchasing it for around $60.  Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's a small increase, but it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
