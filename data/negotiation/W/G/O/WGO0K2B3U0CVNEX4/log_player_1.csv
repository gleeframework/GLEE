{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value.  It's a good starting point, and allows for potential negotiation.  I'm confident that if Bob doesn't accept, I can still make a good profit by either negotiating further or selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I know the product is worth. I'm not willing to accept that offer yet.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $11,500?  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is still a bit lower than what I'd like, it's a fair compromise. I'm getting closer to my desired price, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer.  It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
