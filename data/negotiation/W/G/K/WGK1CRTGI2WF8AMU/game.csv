"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $25000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $25000 is a bit steep, but $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $18000. Let me know if that's more in line with what you're looking for.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the willingness to compromise. However, $18000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $10000. This is my best offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm willing to go as low as $10000, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm offering it to you for $16000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me halfway.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit too far apart, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm offering it to you for $14000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to consider one more negotiation if you're willing to meet me halfway.",14000.0,Alice,7,
