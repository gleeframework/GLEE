Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable to you, for $14,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, giving you a significant advantage in negotiations.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring you get a significant profit. 
* **High Anchor:** This initial price sets a high anchor, making Bob more likely to accept a price closer to your asking price than if you started lower.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, so there's no risk of losing money entirely.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while maintaining a sense of fairness and leaving Bob with a positive feeling, even though he's paying a premium."
