Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe holds great value for your company. My initial price is $1,750,000, reflecting the significant potential it offers. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still too low. I believe there is room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.  I'll counter with a price closer to $1,500,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 doesn't reflect the full value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,600,000. This price acknowledges your needs while allowing me to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,250,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his initial offer, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It seems unlikely that further negotiation will lead to a price that's profitable for me.  To avoid further time and effort, it's best to accept John's offer of $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and guarantees a good outcome."
