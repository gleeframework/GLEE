"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $85.  It's the best I can do.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $85. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $95. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
