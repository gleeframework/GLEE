"Alice, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $16,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we settle on $10,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $10,000, which is $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference again. How about $11,500? This price is fair and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $11,500 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,7,
