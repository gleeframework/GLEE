"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe you'll find great value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's price:**  $119 is less than $120.
* **You still get a good deal:**  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering it for less.

While you might be able to negotiate further with Alice, accepting her offer guarantees you get the product for a price within your budget."
