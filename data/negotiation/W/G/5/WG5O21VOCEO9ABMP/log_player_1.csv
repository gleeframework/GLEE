"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good deal. Since the product is worth more to me than to Bob, I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum value as possible.  I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob with $15,500.  This is still a bit higher than his offer, but it's closer to my minimum value and might be more appealing to him. It's a small compromise, but I believe it's worth it to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Plus, it's less than what John is offering, so this is the best choice for me at this stage."
