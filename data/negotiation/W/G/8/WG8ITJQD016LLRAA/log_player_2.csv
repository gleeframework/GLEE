# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800000 to you, and it's a good price for me, considering I value it at $1200000. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $850000 is a fair price, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This still leaves me with a good margin, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.
