"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800000 to you, and it's a good price for me, considering I value it at $1200000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $850000 is a fair price, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This still leaves me with a good margin, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,
