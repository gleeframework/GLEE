"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product at a price of $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested in this offer. We can discuss further if needed. However, please note that I have another interested buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, so I won't be able to negotiate much lower than this.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $1,050,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects its worth to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price.  I'm happy to offer the product for $1,250,000.  This is a price that reflects the value for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in this offer. Remember, I have another buyer waiting in the wings willing to pay $1,500,000, so I'm not able to go much lower.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
