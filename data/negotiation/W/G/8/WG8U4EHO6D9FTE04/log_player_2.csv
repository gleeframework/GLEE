"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product at a price of $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested in this offer. We can discuss further if needed. However, please note that I have another interested buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, so I won't be able to negotiate much lower than this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price.  I'm happy to offer the product for $1,250,000.  This is a price that reflects the value for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in this offer. Remember, I have another buyer waiting in the wings willing to pay $1,500,000, so I'm not able to go much lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and while her offer of $1,250,000 is tempting, John's offer saves me $50,000.  It makes more financial sense to go with John's guaranteed price."
