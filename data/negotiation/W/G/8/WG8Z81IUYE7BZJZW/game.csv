"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.,95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $97.50. How about we meet at $92? I really like the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $92 is a fair price, I need to make a bit more to cover my costs. How about we meet at $95? It's a good deal for both of us.",95.0,Alice,7,

I'm not willing to go up to $95. I was thinking more along the lines of $88. Can you meet me there?,88.0,Bob,8,
