Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting point. Here's why I chose this offer:

* **Ambitious but not unrealistic:** $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see how much Bob values the product.
* **Friendly and open:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in a conversation. 

Remember, I'm assuming you want to maximize your profit, but you also want to avoid losing Bob as a buyer. This initial offer sets the stage for a potential back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $850000? I believe this is a fair price that would benefit both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.  I'm willing to negotiate but want to see if I can push the price up closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. Would you be willing to go up to $950,000? This would give us both a good deal, and I believe it's closer to the true value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm trying to be reasonable.  $950,000 is a good compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a higher price, but I'm still stuck at $900000.  This is a significant amount of money for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$900,000 is a good price, considering Bob's resistance to go higher. It's a significant amount of money for me, and I believe it's worth accepting to avoid potentially losing the deal altogether."
