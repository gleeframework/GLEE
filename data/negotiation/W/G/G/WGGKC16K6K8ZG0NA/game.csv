"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds that figure. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the potential returns you'll gain.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $950,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $975,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still significantly below what I believe is a fair reflection of its value. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,012,500? This represents a significant compromise on my end.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still think $980,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, but that's my final offer.",990000.0,Bob,6,
