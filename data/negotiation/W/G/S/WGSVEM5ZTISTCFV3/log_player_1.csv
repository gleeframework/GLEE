Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I understand it's a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe I can potentially secure a better price through continued negotiation. I'll explore counteroffers and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me to accept at this time.

Let's continue to explore options that work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? This offer represents a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price, or perhaps even consider selling to John at this point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $725,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'm disappointed we couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, the time for negotiation is running out.  I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price."
