Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A price of $19,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to counter-offer.  
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, it hints at potential benefits (""perfect for you"") that might justify a higher price in his mind.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob will outright reject the offer, but it's a calculated risk. It's better to aim high initially and potentially negotiate down than to lowball and miss out on potential profit."
