"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $9,500, I believe I can get a better price, and I'm not desperate enough to sell to John for only $10,000. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $9,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,500, which would be $10,500. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still holding out for a little more.  I think I can get him to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of $10,500.  It's getting closer, but I'm still a bit too high for me to accept.  How about we split the difference again and go with $11,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you've said you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer $10,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is tempting, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting a worse deal.  John is willing to pay $10,000, and it's better to secure that deal now than to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
