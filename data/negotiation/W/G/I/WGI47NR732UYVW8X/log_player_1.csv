"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $1,100,000 is still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but only to $1,400,000. This is still above Bob's last offer and closer to my target. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and we're running out of rounds. I've already rejected offers below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Selling to John at this point is the best option to ensure I get the desired value for the product."
