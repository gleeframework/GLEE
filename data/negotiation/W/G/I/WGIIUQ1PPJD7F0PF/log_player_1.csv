Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is tempting, I'm still confident I can get a better price, especially since we've already established a range between $900,000 and $925,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offer still hovering around $850,000, the risk of getting stuck with a lower price is too high. It's time to cut my losses and secure the $800,000 offer from John."
