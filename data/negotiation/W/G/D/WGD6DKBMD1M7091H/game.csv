"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $2000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. I'm offering you the product for $1750000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'm offering $1375000.",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1375000 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1562500. This is a fair compromise, and I truly believe this product will be a valuable asset for your business. What do you say?",1562500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1406250 is still quite a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering the product for $1450000. This is my absolute final offer. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I believe this is a price we can both agree on.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
