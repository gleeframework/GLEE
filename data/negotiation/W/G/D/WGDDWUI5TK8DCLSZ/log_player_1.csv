Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum.**  $1,200,000 is a good deal for you, leaving substantial profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value.**  Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so he has room to negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers.**  You can adjust your price if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring a significant profit. 

Remember, this is just the beginning of the negotiation.  Be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is still a good profit, it's worth pushing for a better deal. Bob clearly sees value in the product, and you have a strong starting point to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping for a price closer to $1,100,000. This would still represent a significant value for you, and allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, $950,000 is a very good deal. It's significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000 and still leaves room for a decent profit. It's likely Bob is holding firm at this price, and further negotiations might risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the potential for a lower offer from Bob or having to sell to John."
