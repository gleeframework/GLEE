I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a quick deal. However, I'm leaving room to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to sell for. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is my absolute minimum. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

$95 is still too low for me, but I'm getting closer to my minimum.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
