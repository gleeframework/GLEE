"Hi Alice, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, considering the value this product offers. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
