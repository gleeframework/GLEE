Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $12,000 offer leaves space for potential negotiation with Bob, who might try to haggle the price down. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly hint that the product is worth a significant amount, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind."
