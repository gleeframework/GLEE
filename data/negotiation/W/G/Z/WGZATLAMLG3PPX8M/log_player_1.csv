Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $900,000, I leave room for Bob to counter-offer without making me feel like I'm giving away too much.
* **Focus on Value:** My message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, potentially making him more willing to pay a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  Great! I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects:  I'll wait for his counteroffer and analyze it based on his proposed price and the potential risk of losing him as a buyer. I'll also consider if I'm willing to risk selling to John for $1,000,000, which is my guaranteed value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $850000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still lower than what I'm aiming for.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer. However, there's a chance that I could secure a better deal with Bob if I continue negotiating.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal my unwillingness to settle for his price. It also allows me to explore if I can push for a higher counter-offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to secure a price closer to $900,000. I will analyze his counteroffer to determine my next move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go down to $875,000. This reflects the value of the product and offers a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:** My counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Compromise & Value:** The offer of $875,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This highlights my willingness to compromise and reinforces the value of the product.
* **Closing the Deal:**  The message emphasizes a desire to reach an agreement, potentially encouraging Bob to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my desired value.
* If Bob rejects: I'll carefully assess his next counteroffer and determine if I should accept it, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John. The decision will be based on the price, my time constraints, and my confidence in securing a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $860000 as the price for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $860,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still lower than what I initially aimed for. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of further rounds leading to a lower price is high.  
* **Guaranteed Value:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'm choosing to secure the guaranteed value by selling to John. The potential for a slightly better deal with Bob is not worth the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of a lower price."
