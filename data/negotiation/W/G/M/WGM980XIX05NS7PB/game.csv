"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $130? It's a steal for a product this good!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's try to reach a middle ground.",115.0,Bob,4,
