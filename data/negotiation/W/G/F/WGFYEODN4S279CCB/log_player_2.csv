"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $13,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Current Price:** $13,000
* **Bob's Max:** $15,000
* **Alice's Min:** $10,000 (We know this from the initial setup)

At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, he's already gotten a decent price and risks losing the deal.  There's also the risk that Alice might get even more stubborn and raise her price, forcing Bob to either buy from John at a higher price or walk away empty-handed."
