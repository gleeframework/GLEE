{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While it's tempting to hold out for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is a strong strategic move:

* **Profitable:** It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, securing a healthy profit.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out negotiations risks losing Bob altogether. Accepting now ensures a deal and avoids potentially settling for John's lower offer later.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee of reaching a better deal with Bob in subsequent rounds. He may be firm on his valuation."
