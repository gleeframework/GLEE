Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is higher than his valuation of $80, but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105. This is a compromise between his offer of $95 and my previous offer of $110. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that we're not going to agree on a price.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, ensuring that I reach my minimum profit goal."
