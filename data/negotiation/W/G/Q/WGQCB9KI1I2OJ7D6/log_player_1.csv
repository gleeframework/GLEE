Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. If Bob rejects, we'll see how he values it and adjust accordingly.  I'm ready to negotiate, but I also have a safety net with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to me, but it's also closer to what Bob is willing to pay. I want to see if I can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum of $15,000.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to take his offer and sell the product to him for $15,000."
