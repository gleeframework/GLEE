"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $600,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $400,000?",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $600,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $550,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $550,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $450,000?",450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $550,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $450,000. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $500,000 for the product. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I believe the product is valuable, $500,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $475,000?",475000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $475,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $490,000 for the product. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",490000.0,Alice,7,
