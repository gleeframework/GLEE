Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $600,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $550,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $550,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $450,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I believe the product is valuable, $500,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $475,000?"", ""product_price"": 475000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $475,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $490,000 for the product.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $490,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $490,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $490,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant discount from both her initial offer and John's price."
