{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values it at $8,000, so $9,500 gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You want at least $10,000, so this leaves space for you to counter if needed.
* **It shows you're flexible:**  By starting with a lower offer than your minimum, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep my investment within $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to reach a price I'm comfortable with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I really appreciate it. While I understand your position, I'm still not able to go above $8,500 for this product. Is there any chance you could meet me halfway?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I believe I can get closer to my target price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. How about $9,250? That's closer to your offer, and it's a price that I can live with. It's a great opportunity for you to get a quality product at a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I'd like to stay close to my original budget. Could we possibly agree on $8,750 for the product? This would be a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,750 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems we're at an impasse. Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on a better deal, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $10,000.  This guarantees me my desired profit, and I avoid any further potential negotiation headaches."
