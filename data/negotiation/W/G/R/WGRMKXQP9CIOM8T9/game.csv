"Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it can be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you and my own value for it. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm not comfortable going that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous offers.  How about $825,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but no higher. I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. Can you meet me at that price?",750000.0,Bob,4,
