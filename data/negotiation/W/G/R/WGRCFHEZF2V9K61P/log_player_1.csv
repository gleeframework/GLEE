``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum price of $150, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to $175 as possible, but I'm also willing to compromise to secure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $175 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counteroffer to try and get a better price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. How about $120? That seems like a fair compromise.

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price."
