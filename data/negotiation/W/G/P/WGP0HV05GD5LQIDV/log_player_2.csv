Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $850,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.
