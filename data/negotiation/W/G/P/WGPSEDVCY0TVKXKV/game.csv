"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,800 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $8,200, which is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's close this deal.",8200.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,200. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $8,600. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",8600.0,Alice,5,
