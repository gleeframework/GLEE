"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, there's still a buffer to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,800 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $8,200, which is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,200. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $8,600. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer is getting close to Bob's ideal price of $8,000, but it's still higher.  Bob has only 5 rounds left, and further negotiation could be risky.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $8,000, it's the safest and most financially advantageous option to accept John's offer and end the negotiation with Alice."
