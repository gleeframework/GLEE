{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but it still gives me room to negotiate if he counteroffers. It also leaves some potential profit for me, while still being a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to sell it to John for $120, Bob's offer of $100 is still within my acceptable range and allows me to make a profit. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but there's also a risk that Bob will walk away completely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
