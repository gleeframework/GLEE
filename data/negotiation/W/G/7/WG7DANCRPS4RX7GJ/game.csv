"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a little too high for me. Could you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
