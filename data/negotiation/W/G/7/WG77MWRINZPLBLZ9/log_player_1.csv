Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer that I think is reasonable, considering the value of the product to me.

{""product_price"": $850,000}

This is a price that is slightly higher than the minimum value of the product to me, but still relatively reasonable given its worth. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value of the product, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll think carefully about my next move and come up with a counteroffer that takes into account Bob's willingness to pay $750,000, but also reflects the value of the product to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Based on Bob's previous offer of $750,000, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than his offer, but still below my minimum value of $850,000.

{""product_price"": $795,000}

This counteroffer is a compromise that tries to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and my minimum value. Let's see how Bob responds!"
