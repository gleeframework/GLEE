Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this opportunity."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but the message emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" to encourage Bob to reconsider. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Creating a sense of urgency with a ""limited-time offer"" might push Bob towards a quicker decision in your favor.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach.  Negotiation is fluid. If you knew more about Bob's negotiation style or the specifics of the product, you might tailor the offer differently."
