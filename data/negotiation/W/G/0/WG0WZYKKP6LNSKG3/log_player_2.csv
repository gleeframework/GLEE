"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a great deal to both of us. I'm starting with an offer of $1750000. This price reflects the value and potential of the product. I'm open to discussing a fair price, so let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  You're looking to save as much money as possible and $1,750,000 is more than your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,400,000.  This product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1400000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm happy to compromise and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value we both see in this product. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,600,000 is still above your desired range.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get even closer to your target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to come in under $1,500,000.  Let's try $1,450,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $1450000 is closer to my bottom line, it still falls short of what this product is truly worth. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1550000. This is a final offer, and it allows us both to secure a profitable deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, you can potentially save more money by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting this offer allows you to counter and attempt to bring the price down further. Remember, you're trying to maximize your savings!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,550,000 is still above my target.  I'm willing to go up to $1,525,000, which is a fair compromise.  This deal is important to me, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1525000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close.  $1525000 is almost there, but I'm still a bit short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1537500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,537,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,537,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where the price is close to your budget, but it's still not ideal.  Alice is likely unwilling to budge further, and you're nearing the end of your negotiation rounds.  Given that John is willing to sell for your maximum budget of $1,500,000, it's a safer bet to purchase from John and avoid any further potential for Alice to increase the price."
