"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $16,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. ",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit far from that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,500. Can we meet in the middle?",13500.0,Bob,4,
