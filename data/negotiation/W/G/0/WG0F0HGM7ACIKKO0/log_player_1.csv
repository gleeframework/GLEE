"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000.  This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. Since I have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000, I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering my minimum value and Bob's willingness to pay. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as I'm not willing to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a compromise, moving halfway from my last offer of $1,200,000 towards Bob's last offer of $950,000.  I hope this signals my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum value. It's becoming increasingly unlikely that he will come up to my price, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John."
