"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price reflects the product's unique value and its potential for success. I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
