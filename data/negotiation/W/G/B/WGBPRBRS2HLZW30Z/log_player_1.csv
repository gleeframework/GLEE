"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's still significantly lower than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob gets from the product to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message upbeat and encouraging a deal. 

**Strategy:** 

I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my desired price point.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer. I also have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price, giving me a safety net throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is far below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob is willing to pay more than his initial assessment, he's still significantly below my target. This indicates there's room for further negotiation.
* **Safety Net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 at any point, which provides a strong fallback. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I want to gauge his willingness to come up in price and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This gives you a good price and me a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the compromise:**  I'm explicitly stating that I'm meeting Bob halfway, making the offer more appealing.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, suggesting that we can find common ground.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer.
* If Bob rejects again, I'll continue to adjust my offer based on his counteroffers, always keeping my minimum price in mind and my option to sell to John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  We've already had a few rounds, and it seems Bob isn't willing to go much higher. 
* **John's offer provides security:**  I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, which is significantly more than what Bob is currently offering.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further, but I'm not afraid to walk away and accept John's offer if the deal with Bob doesn't get closer to my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment.  I'm willing to go down to $975,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm setting a clear boundary with this being my ""final"" offer. This adds pressure to Bob and encourages a quick decision.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm making a small concession but staying above my minimum price. This shows I'm serious about finding a deal but won't settle for an unfair price.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, considering the value he gets from the product.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated risk. I'm testing Bob's willingness to close the deal. If he rejects, I have the secure option of selling to John.  But, if he accepts, I'll secure a decent price with only a few rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. Would you be willing to consider $915,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Short:** Bob's offer of $915,000 is still below my minimum price of $1,200,000. 
* **Limited Time:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk that Bob might continue to lowball me. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a higher profit than what Bob is currently offering.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, I need to be realistic about the deal's potential.  Selling to John secures a better outcome and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob, who may not be willing to meet my minimum price."
