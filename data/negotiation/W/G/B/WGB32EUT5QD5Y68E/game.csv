"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. Considering your offer of $9500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $11000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10200, but no more. Can you consider this revised offer?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your revised offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10200. Considering the product's value to me is $15000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $12500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,5,
