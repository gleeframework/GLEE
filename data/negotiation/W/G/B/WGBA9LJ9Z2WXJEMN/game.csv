"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,200. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",10200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. While $10,200 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still not satisfied with the price, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,800. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",9800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $9,000? That's the most I can justify spending on this.",9000.0,Bob,6,
