"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  My starting price is $900,000. This reflects its unique value and potential.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $750,000.  This would allow us both to make a fair profit and close the deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $750,000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects a compromise on my side, and I believe it's still a fair price given the product's potential. Let's work towards a deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a significant investment for me, and it's the absolute highest I can go. Let's see if we can find common ground.",825000.0,Bob,4,
