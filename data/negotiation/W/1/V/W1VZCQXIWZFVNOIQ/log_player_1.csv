Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

However, I still need to make a profit on this sale, and $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $900,000 to make it worth my while.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.
