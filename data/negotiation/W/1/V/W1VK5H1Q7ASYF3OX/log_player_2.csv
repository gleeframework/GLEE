"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $8,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I understand you see value in the product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,750 is closer, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $8,250?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I'm willing to be flexible, but $8,250 is cutting it pretty close to my bottom line.  Could you meet me at $8,500 and we'll have a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, and $8,500 is a good price â€“ a $1,500 savings over John's offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better result, and there's a risk Alice might retract her offer."
