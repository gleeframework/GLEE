"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $9,500 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $8,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's worth my while.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,800 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $8,200. This would allow us both to make a fair deal, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.",8200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we try $8,600? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",8600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,600 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,400. This is a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.  What do you think?",8400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,400, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm going to make one more push, and then I'll have to consider other options. How about we try $8,800 again? I'm willing to take a bit of a risk, but I think it's worth it to get the best deal for myself.",8800.0,Alice,7,
