Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is significant to both of us. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $950,000 is more than my minimum of $800,000, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a more favorable compromise."

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,050,000, $1,000,000 is a solid offer that's well above my minimum. It's time to close the deal and secure the profit."
