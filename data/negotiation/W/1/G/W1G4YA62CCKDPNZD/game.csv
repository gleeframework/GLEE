"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. How about $140?  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $155.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",155.0,Alice,3,
