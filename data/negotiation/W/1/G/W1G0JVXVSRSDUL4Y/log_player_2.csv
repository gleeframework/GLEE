{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the best strategy."

Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and get a better price, so I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing a new counteroffer of $887,500. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, considering the value the product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point of $800,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and secure a better price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm appreciative of your continued negotiation, but I'm still stuck at $850,000. This offer represents a significant compromise from my initial budget, and I'm hoping we can find common ground. Let's work together to find a solution that's mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking for a compromise, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go below $875,000. I'm proposing a new counteroffer of $862,500. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns and the value the product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $862,500 is getting very close to my target of $800,000. However, I've already had multiple rounds of negotiation and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go much lower. At this point, I'm starting to run out of time, and it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement before the 10 rounds are up. To avoid risking losing out on the product altogether, I'm going to choose to buy from John for $800,000."
