,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my initial ask, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value I believe it brings to the table.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I can only go up to $875,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing a new counteroffer of $887,500. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, considering the value the product brings to the table.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm appreciative of your continued negotiation, but I'm still stuck at $850,000. This offer represents a significant compromise from my initial budget, and I'm hoping we can find common ground. Let's work together to find a solution that's mutually beneficial.",850000.0,Bob,6,
