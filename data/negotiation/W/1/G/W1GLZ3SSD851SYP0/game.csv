"Alice, your offer is a bit out of my price range.  While I see the value of the product, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the immense value this product will bring you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. However, I need to be fair to the value of what I'm offering. Let's settle at $1,050,000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
