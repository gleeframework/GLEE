"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, given the significant value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Alice's offer is still $200,000 more than her own value for the product. This means there's room for negotiation. 
* **Alice's Motivation:** Alice is clearly motivated to sell, as her offer is significantly lower than what she'd get from John. This gives Bob leverage.

By rejecting the offer, Bob can counter with a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the value you place on the product, I'm willing to offer you $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Deal:**  Alice's offer of $950,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Upside:**  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise, or he might reach a stalemate.
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John would cost Bob $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Alice's current offer. 

Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking a more expensive outcome or a lengthy negotiation."
