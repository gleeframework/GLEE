"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $120.  It's worth a lot more to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is a significant markup from her perceived value. I should counter with a lower price to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Alice's perceived value ($80) to give myself room to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount. 
* **Polite and Engaged:** My message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, signaling that I'm serious about the purchase but want a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $85 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $100?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but $100 is still too high. I'll counter again, aiming for a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. Let's meet in the middle. How about $90? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm suggesting a price directly in the middle of our previous offers, demonstrating a willingness to find common ground.
* **Direct and Concise:**  The message is brief and clear, emphasizing the compromise I'm proposing. 
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:**  I continue to use a friendly and collaborative tone to encourage Alice to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  This would be a fantastic deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $95 is a reasonable price, well below my $150 maximum and a significant savings from Alice's initial offer.
* **Limited Time:** We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds. Continuing to push for a slightly lower price might not be worth the risk of the deal falling through. 
* **Building Rapport:** Accepting Alice's compromise shows goodwill and builds a positive foundation for a potential future interaction."
