"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $85 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $100?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. Let's meet in the middle. How about $90? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  This would be a fantastic deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
