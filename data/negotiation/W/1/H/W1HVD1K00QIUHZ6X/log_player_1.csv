{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $125. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring you potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $115? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I think $115 is a bit high. Would you be willing to go down to $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $105 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $110. Let's split the difference and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's clear we're not going to reach an agreement. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
