Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for a profit, so $1,100,000 is a good start.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay more, so there's room for him to counteroffer, and for you to potentially increase the price further.
* **It's a reasonable opening price:** $1,100,000 is closer to your minimum than to Bob's maximum, suggesting a willingness to negotiate while still being profitable for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation, doing so would result in a loss for you.

**Reasoning:**

* **Loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling below your minimum acceptable price, resulting in a loss.
* **Potential for higher price:** You know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's potential to negotiate a higher price.
* **John as a safety net:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always a viable option, ensuring you at least break even.

**Next Step:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, you initiate the next round of negotiation. This allows you to counteroffer and try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $950,000 is tempting, it's unfortunately below my minimum for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This still gives you a significant value, and it's a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to find a compromise between your minimum acceptable price and Bob's initial offer.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** By offering $1,050,000, you're showing flexibility while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights the product's value to Bob, emphasizing that the price is fair considering its potential.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes a desire to reach a solution that works for both parties, keeping the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. I'd be willing to pay $980,000 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $980,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, doing so would result in a loss. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling below my minimum acceptable price, resulting in a loss.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** Bob has stated that $980,000 is his final offer. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price.
* **John Provides a Safe and Profitable Outcome:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

Given the current situation, selling to John for $1,000,000 is the most sensible decision. It ensures that I achieve my minimum profit while avoiding potential losses with Bob."
