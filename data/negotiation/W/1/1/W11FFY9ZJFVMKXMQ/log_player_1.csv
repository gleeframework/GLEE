Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would really be valuable for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too expensive for me right now. I could do $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $75? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to get at least $100 for the product.  How about we split the difference and call it $87.50?"", ""product_price"": 87.50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm on a tight budget. I can do $80, my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than $80. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $150. It makes more financial sense to cut your losses with Bob and sell to John."
