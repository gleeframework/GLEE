Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer allows for some back-and-forth negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum ($100).
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to accept any offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that's a little steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is above my minimum, I think there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer was a significant jump down, suggesting he's willing to pay more than his initial offer. I'll counter to see if I can get closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value while signaling a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Close to Target:** $110 is a strong profit margin, and I'm hoping Bob finds it reasonable enough to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's getting closer, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $107 is a good price, exceeding my minimum by a reasonable amount. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a dollar or two more. It's probably not worth the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now means I get paid sooner."
