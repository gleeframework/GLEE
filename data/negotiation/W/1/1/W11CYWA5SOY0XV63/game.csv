,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $92.50, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",92.5,Alice,5,
