"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $700,000, which reflects a fair value based on my own assessment.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $700,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower figure. How about we settle on $800,000? This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows us to finalize this transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is already a significant concession from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a decent return on my investment. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to secure a good price, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise closer to my initial offer. Let's split the difference - how about $812,500? This would ensure a mutually beneficial outcome, and I believe we can finalize the deal.  What do you say?",812500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm not willing to go any higher than $820,000. This is already a compromise from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a decent return on my investment. Let's see if we can find a final agreement.",820000.0,Alice,7,
