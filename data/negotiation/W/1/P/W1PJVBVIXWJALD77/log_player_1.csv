**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently making offers significantly below your minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that works for you within the remaining rounds. To ensure you get your minimum price, it's time to cut negotiations with Bob and sell to John, who is offering a guaranteed $1,200,000."
