"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process and potentially achieve a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product.  However, $11,500 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, considering the price I could get from John. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is significantly below its true value.  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While Alice's new offer is better than her previous one, it's still above Bob's desired price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially secure a price closer to his target by continuing to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, considering the market value and my budget.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
