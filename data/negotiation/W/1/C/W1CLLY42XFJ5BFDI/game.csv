"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. I'm really interested in this product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $9000? ",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $9000. How about we settle on $10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $10000?  That way, we both get a good deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and $10000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
