"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's minimum value as possible.  Offering $10,500 gives Alice a bit of profit, but it also significantly reduces the price from Alice's initial offer, giving Bob a significant savings. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500. This is a good deal for Bob, as it is significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and only slightly higher than Bob's last counteroffer. There's a good chance Alice might not lower the price any further, so it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and save money."
