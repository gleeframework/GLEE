Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering Bob the product for $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant profit for me, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm also confident that I can sell the product to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $11,500. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price that Bob might accept, considering he's already willing to pay more than my minimum."
