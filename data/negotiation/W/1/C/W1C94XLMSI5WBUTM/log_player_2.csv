"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a good deal, however, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must be upfront - $1,200,000 is the absolute lowest I can go for this product. I have another buyer interested at that price, but I believe this product holds more value for you and would prefer to see it in your hands. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is the best move at this point. Here's why:

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice has explicitly stated that $1,200,000 is her lowest price. It's likely she won't budge further, especially with another potential buyer in the picture.
* **Saving Money:** You're getting a $300,000 discount from John's price. While you might aim for a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay $1,500,000 to John outweighs the potential for a small additional saving. 
* **Limited Rounds:** You still have rounds to spare, but continuing to negotiate aggressively might make Alice walk away.

Accepting now secures the product at a good price."
