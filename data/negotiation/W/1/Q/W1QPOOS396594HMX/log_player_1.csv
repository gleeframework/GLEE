Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The wording suggests flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer if he's not happy with the initial price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profits while leaving room for a potential win-win scenario for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $70 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for compromise:**  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for such a low price without trying to get closer to my target.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $100 gives me leverage in negotiations.

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, but I'll be prepared to walk away if he refuses to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. It's a great product, and I think you'll find it worth the investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price from $95 to $85, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Open-ended question:** Encourages Bob to respond and continue negotiations.

This counteroffer maintains a price above my minimum while keeping the negotiation alive.  I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't budge, but I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $75? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range, and Bob has indicated this is his final offer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a risk of going back and forth with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price than I'm comfortable with. 
* **John's offer is a guaranteed win:**  Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is significantly better than accepting Bob's final offer and potentially losing more time negotiating.

Although I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price,  I'll take the safe route and secure the guaranteed $100 from John."
