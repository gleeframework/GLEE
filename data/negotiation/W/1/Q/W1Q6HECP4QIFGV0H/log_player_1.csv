Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial offer of $950,000.  This feels like a fair starting point, given its potential. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. After evaluating the situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both my minimum price ($800,000) and his stated value ($1,000,000). Accepting would mean a significant loss for me. While selling to John is an option, it's early in the negotiation, and I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob.  I'll counter-offer in the next round to guide the price closer to a mutually beneficial point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers you a substantial return on investment, considering its worth to you. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its value to both of us."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** While Bob's offer was too low, I want to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. Coming down by $50,000 shows flexibility.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to anchor his perception closer to the $1,000,000 mark. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer keeps the price well above my minimum while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still looking to keep the price closer to my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $850,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price and represents a substantial profit. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a good outcome, and it's always better to secure a deal than risk losing it for a potentially marginal gain."
