Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Strong Starting Point:** Starting at $15,000 gives you bargaining room.  Even if Bob negotiates you down, you're likely to land above your minimum. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message highlights the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While $10,000 is Bob's perceived value, he might be willing to pay a premium for exclusivity or faster access.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in mind will help you maximize your profit."
