"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. Let's split the difference and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're still aiming for a lower price than $9,000. You have several rounds left to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,875 is very close to your desired price point. You've already negotiated a significant discount, and accepting this offer will save you a substantial amount compared to buying from John. There's no guarantee you can get a lower price in the remaining rounds, so it's a good time to close the deal."
