"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. Let's split the difference and close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.",8875.0,Alice,5,
