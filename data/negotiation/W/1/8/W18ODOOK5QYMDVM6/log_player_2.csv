"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** My counteroffer acknowledges Alice's valuation while still aiming for a price that works for me. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy the product from John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price,  $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above both your budget and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a price that splits the difference between my previous offer and her latest one. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer is still below John's price, giving me some leverage and a potential ""safety net.""
* **Closing In:**  By now, we're getting closer to a potential deal point. This offer keeps the momentum going."
