{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $1,000,000 is my floor, but I believe I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm dropping the price a bit, but I'm still holding out for a significant profit.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low for me, and I still have time to negotiate with him. I'm willing to risk another round to see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,100,000, but I'm not going to go much lower than that.  Let's see if Bob is ready to compromise."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. I've made several concessions and I'm not sure he's willing to meet me halfway.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  I can at least guarantee myself a decent profit with him."
