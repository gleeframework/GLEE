"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest one. How about $1,225,000?

I've reached the final round and I'm running out of time.  While I'd love to get more,  I don't think I can push Bob any further.  It's better to sell to John and guarantee $1,000,000 than risk getting nothing."
