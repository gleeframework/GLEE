"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value and my current financial limitations.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and prove to be a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,075,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
