"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is significantly below my asking price, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This price still provides significant value to you, while also allowing me to recover a reasonable portion of the product's worth.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more conservative with my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 is still too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This price is a fair compromise, and it allows you to get a valuable product at a price that's within your budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
