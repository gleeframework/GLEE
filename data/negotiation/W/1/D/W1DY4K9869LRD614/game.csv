"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move closer to your figure. How about we settle on $1,125,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,125,000. How about we settle on $1,087,500? This feels like a fair price for both of us.",1087500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for both of us.  While I'm motivated to sell, I do have a firm bottom line. Would you consider $1,100,000? This is a significant price reduction on my end and I believe reflects the true value of this product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm getting close to my target, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
