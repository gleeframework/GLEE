"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $9000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500. This price still allows me to make a profit and gives you a great product at a fair price. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $8500. How about we split the difference and go with $8250? It's a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
