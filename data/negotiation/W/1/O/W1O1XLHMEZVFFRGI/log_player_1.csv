Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay more, especially if he perceives a sense of urgency or exclusivity in the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $20,000, we give ourselves room to negotiate down if Bob counters. This increases the chances of finding a price that works for both of us while still staying above our minimum of $15,000.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so there's less risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust the price accordingly."
