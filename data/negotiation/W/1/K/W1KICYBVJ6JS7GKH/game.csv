"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to make you a great deal.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to be flexible,  $1,100,000 is too far below my desired price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,250,000. This allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I'm really interested in this product, but $1,200,000 is still a little higher than I can go.  I'm willing to pay $1,175,000. This price allows for a fair deal for both of us and hopefully allows us to close this transaction.  Let me know what you think.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close to a deal. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $1,175,000 is still a little low for me.  Let's compromise once more. I'm willing to drop the price to $1,190,000. This price gives us both a fair outcome. What do you say?",1190000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're almost there! I'm willing to go up to $1,180,000.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",1180000.0,Bob,8,
