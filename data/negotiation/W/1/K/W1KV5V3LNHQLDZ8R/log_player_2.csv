"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** It's below your maximum value of $8,000, but there's room for negotiation. 
* **You want to try to get a better price.**  Since you have 10 rounds, there's no need to rush into a decision. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** It's a good safety net, but you'll get a better deal if you can negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested, but $7,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing that you're serious about getting a better deal.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  By offering $7,000, you're setting the stage for a back-and-forth, giving Alice space to counter without immediately resorting to John. 
* **Focus on your value:**  You're not just throwing out a random number; you're stating your desired price and tying it to your interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,250. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your target.** $7,250 is a decent price, especially considering you have 7 rounds left.
* **Risk of further negotiation.** While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a chance Alice will reject further counteroffers, and you might end up paying more if you have to buy from John.
* **Time is a factor.** It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price now than risk running out of rounds and having to pay John's full price."
