"Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $100? I'm genuinely interested in the product but need to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you the product for $175. Is that something you'd be interested in?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $150?  I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I've already mentioned to you that I need to make a profit, and $150 is the minimum I can sell it for. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'm not willing to go lower. So, I'm sticking with my minimum price of $150. If you're really interested, I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, but I'm not budging further.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $140, which is my absolute maximum.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, but I've already told you that $150 is my minimum price. I'm not willing to go lower than that. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount since you're willing to meet me halfway. I can offer you the product for $155, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",155.0,Alice,7,
