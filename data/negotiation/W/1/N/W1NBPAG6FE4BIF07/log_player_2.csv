"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This item holds significant value to me, and I believe it would be equally beneficial for you. Given its worth to both parties, I am offering you the chance to purchase this product at a special price of $950,000. This offer is tailored to provide you with substantial savings while ensuring a fair return for my investment. I trust that this proposal aligns with your interests and budget. Please let me know if you require any additional information or have questions about the product. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than your maximum budget and more importantly, more expensive than John's offer. You can save $150,000 by going with John."
