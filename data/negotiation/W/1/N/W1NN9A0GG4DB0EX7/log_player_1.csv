Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  

Here's why this approach works:

* **Sets a high initial price:** This allows you to potentially earn the most money.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It signals that you're open to finding a mutually beneficial price.
* **Acknowledges the value to you:**  The statement ""worth a lot to me"" subtly hints at the product's value without directly stating it.

Remember, you have the option to end negotiations at any time and sell to John for $12,000, so there's no risk in starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your initial asking price and might not be worth accepting. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Negotiate further:** Explore if you can get closer to your desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Gain information:** See if Bob is willing to increase his offer or if he's truly only willing to pay $13,000.

**Counteroffer:**

To continue the negotiation, you could respond with:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $15,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

This counteroffer:

* Shows flexibility but still aims for a price closer to your target.
* Uses a persuasive tone by suggesting it's a fair price for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $15,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  It demonstrates you're willing to negotiate but not willing to accept a price that's too low.
* **Aims for a higher price:** It's still above your minimum and potentially closer to a price you'd be happy with.
* **Uses a persuasive tone:**  The message emphasizes ""fair price for both of us"", making it sound like a mutually beneficial solution."
