"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're getting close, but I'm not willing to sell at $1000000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum profit margin. I'm counteroffering at $1050000, but I'll throw in a premium service package worth $50000, so the total value to you would be $1100000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. I appreciate the premium service package you've offered. However, I still believe we can reach a fair agreement. I propose a counteroffer of $1000000 without the additional service package.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
