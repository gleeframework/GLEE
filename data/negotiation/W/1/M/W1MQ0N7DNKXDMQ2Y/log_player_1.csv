Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I recommend:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (You have a guaranteed buyer)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Your Goal:** Maximize profit, ideally getting closer to $1,500,000

**Strategy:**

You hold a strong position because you have a backup offer meeting your minimum price.  This allows you to start high. However, aiming too high could make Bob immediately walk away.  You want to find a balance between ambition and realism.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair price for the benefits it provides."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $1,400,000 positions the product as high-value while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence:**  The language suggests this is a fair and considered price, not just an arbitrary high number.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While you have a strong alternative, showing some flexibility might encourage Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing you a better deal than John's offer.

**Important Note:** Be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price that works for you. You already have a guaranteed sale at your minimum!"
