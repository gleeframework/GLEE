{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm asking for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly below what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.  It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and I'm willing to pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to the $95 I originally offered. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I really appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $90, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I am willing to pay $88 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum price of $80, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal with him. I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $88."
