Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer.

Please let me know if this is something you would consider.

While $9,500 is better than $10,000, I'm still hoping to get a lower price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target of $8,000."
