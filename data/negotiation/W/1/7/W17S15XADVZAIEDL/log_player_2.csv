Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $105.  While she might budge a little, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price and you ending up having to pay more than John's $100 offer. You've made a good attempt to negotiate, but it's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the guaranteed lower price."
