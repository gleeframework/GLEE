"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. It seems we both recognize the value of this product. How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000? This reflects my initial investment and acknowledges your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can reach a deal if we stay closer to my initial offer. I'm happy to come up to $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your effort to reach a deal. However, $1,600,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. If you're truly committed to selling, I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both recognize in the product.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
