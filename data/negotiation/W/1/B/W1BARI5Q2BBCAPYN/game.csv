"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. How about we start the negotiations at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this price reflects its true value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a valuable product, Alice, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, say $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
