Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product at a higher price point.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John for $1,500,000, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,800,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's current proposal. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for potential profit.  If Bob rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now the same as John's offer.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a better deal. I'm not willing to risk losing the potential profit and wasting more time.  Therefore, I'll accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,500,000."
