"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,300,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above Bob's perceived value and below our minimum. There's room for negotiation, and John's offer provides a good safety net."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,600,000.  Perhaps we could explore if there are additional elements I can include to bridge the difference?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I can't justify going above $1,300,000 for the product. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has signaled that $1,300,000 is his absolute limit. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get much closer to our $1,500,000 minimum. Accepting John's offer guarantees us the best possible outcome in this situation."
