{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You still have room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  This price signals that you're serious about selling to Bob, but you're not desperate. 

Remember, the key to a successful negotiation is to be flexible and willing to compromise. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob, but also be prepared to walk away if you don't feel the offer is fair."
