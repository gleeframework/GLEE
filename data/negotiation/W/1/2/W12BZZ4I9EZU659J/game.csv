"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $10,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you do $17,000? I'm willing to negotiate but need to find a fair middle ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
