"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is above my minimum value of $8,000 but not excessively high, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value, so I will reject it. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $8,500. This is still higher than my minimum value, but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and we're only on round 4. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer. Selling to John for $8,000 is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
