"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product and is within my acceptable range. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000, but I'm also willing to make a compromise. How about we meet at $950,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering the value we both see in this product, I believe $825,000 is a fair price that we can both agree on. This offer reflects a compromise and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $825,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $925,000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still above what I can afford. I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting close to the point where I'll have to consider selling the product to another buyer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $950,000 was too high, but I can do $920,000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, and I truly want to finalize this deal. However, $920,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to offer $890,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that meets our mutual needs.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",890000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $900,000 was too high, but I can do $915,000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",915000.0,Alice,9,
