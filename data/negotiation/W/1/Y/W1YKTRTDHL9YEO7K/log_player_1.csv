{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,450,000.  I know this product holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair price considering its potential. Let me know your decision - this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Secure the Deal:**  Offering slightly under his perceived value increases the chance of Bob accepting immediately. 
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit encourages a faster decision, preventing Bob from overthinking or trying to negotiate further down.

**Why this strategy works:**

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts the deal. By offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation, you present a win-win situation:

* **Bob wins** by acquiring the product for less than what he thinks it's worth.
* **You win** by securing a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price."
