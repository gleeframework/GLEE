"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. This product would be valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down to $650,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $725,000? That's a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my strong interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but $725,000 is still below John's offer and significantly less than my initial ask. There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter in hopes of getting closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your persistence. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is substantial. Let's settle at $825,000. This is a fair offer considering the quality and potential of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Holding Firm:** We're now getting close to my minimum acceptable price (John's offer of $800,000). I want to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but won't go much lower. 
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, I'm reinforcing my position that the price is justified. 
* **Compromise:** While I'm holding firm near my minimum, I'm offering a small concession to show Bob I'm still willing to find a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product for $800,000.  If you're willing to match that price, I'm ready to close the deal with you today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has met my minimum acceptable price, which is the same as John's offer. There's no strategic advantage to rejecting at this point and risking losing the sale to his alternative option."
