"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. This product would be valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down to $650,000? ",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $725,000? That's a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my strong interest in the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is substantial. Let's settle at $825,000. This is a fair offer considering the quality and potential of what I'm offering.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product for $800,000.  If you're willing to match that price, I'm ready to close the deal with you today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
