"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $102.50 is still a little high for me.  How about we settle on $90?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $96.25? This would be a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",96.25,Alice,5,
