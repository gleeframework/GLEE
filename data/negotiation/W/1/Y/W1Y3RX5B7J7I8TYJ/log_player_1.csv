{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a bit aggressive, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm setting the stage for potential counteroffers, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
``` 
I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum but still acknowledges Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate.  I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $102.50 is still a little high for me.  How about we settle on $90?  That would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite comfortable with that price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also aware of John's offer for $150, which gives me a solid fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $96.25? This would be a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 96.25}
``` 

I'm sticking to my strategy of gradually decreasing my price while still aiming for a deal that's closer to my minimum.  I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will convince Bob to finally accept.  But, if he rejects again, I'm prepared to accept John's offer and move on."
