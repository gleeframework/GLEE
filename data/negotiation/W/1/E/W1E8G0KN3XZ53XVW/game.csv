"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the value I can derive from the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we consider $1,700,000? I think this reflects the value it brings while still being a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far off from my target. I'd like to propose $1,300,000 as a more reasonable price for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer, but there's still a gap between us. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise from my original position, and I believe it reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you. ",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,550,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the most I'm willing to pay. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
