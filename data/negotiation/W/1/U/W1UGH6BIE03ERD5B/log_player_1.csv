Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still being significantly higher than my minimum value of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'd like to try and get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still getting a higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is closer to my desired price than my minimum acceptable price and is a better price than what I could get from John. I'll accept his offer."
