{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is higher than his perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get at least $110 from Bob, as it's better than his current option of not buying the product.  If he rejects, I can always go to John for a guaranteed $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $100.  This is a compromise, but still leaves a decent profit margin for me.  It's also a fair price considering Bob's initial offer was significantly lower than my desired price. I'm confident that Bob will accept this offer as it's a good deal for him,  but I'm still prepared to go to John if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum price of $120, I'm still not satisfied.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make one last counteroffer.  If he rejects that, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

This is my final offer to Bob. It's a compromise, but still gives me a reasonable profit margin. If he rejects it, I'm prepared to sell the product to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has consistently refused to budge on his offer, and I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum price of $120.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for a guaranteed $120."
