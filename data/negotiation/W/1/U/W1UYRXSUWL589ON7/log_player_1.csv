"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a better offer than John's $80, it's still below my minimum desired price of $80.  It's worth trying to negotiate a bit higher with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to come down to $90.  How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your original price, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $87.50. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $87.50 is above my minimum price of $80, and it's a good compromise.  Accepting his offer means I can secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or potentially having to sell to John for less."
