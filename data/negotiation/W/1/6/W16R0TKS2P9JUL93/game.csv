"Hello Bob, I have a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's getting closer to my minimum price of $12,000.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While $11,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go to $10,500. This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about making this deal happen.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it's getting closer to my minimum price of $12,000.",11500.0,Alice,7,
