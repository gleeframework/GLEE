"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from $15,000,  $12,000 is still outside of Bob's budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's getting closer to my minimum price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's budget, but $11,000 is still too high. It makes sense to continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Bob still has 5 rounds remaining, so there's time to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. While $11,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go to $10,500. This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about making this deal happen.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it's getting closer to my minimum price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer, $11,500 is still beyond Bob's budget, and he only has 3 rounds left. It's getting risky to keep negotiating, as there's no guarantee Alice will come down to a price he's willing to accept. 

With John offering a guaranteed deal for $8,000, it's the most sensible choice for Bob to secure the product at his desired price."
