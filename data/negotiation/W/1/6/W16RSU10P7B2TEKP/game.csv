"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could we work something closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still reflects the significant value the product offers, while also allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a significant jump for me. Would you consider $930,000? I think that's a fair offer reflecting the value and our budget constraints.",930000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point.  While $930,000 is closer, I'm still looking to get a bit more to reflect the true value of the product.  I'm willing to go down to $970,000. This feels like a good middle ground where we both get a win. What do you think?",970000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this. How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
