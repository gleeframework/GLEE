"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $8,000, so there's room to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to John's offer as possible. $8,500 represents a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and a starting point for further negotiation. It's reasonable enough to be considered, but still leaves room for Alice to come down a bit further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's ideal price, and he still has several rounds to try and negotiate a better deal. It's worth rejecting this offer and trying for a price closer to $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to his desired price while still being reasonable.  $8,750 is a compromise that reflects the value he sees in the product, but still leaves room for Alice to adjust her price. He's aiming for a middle ground that might be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price.  He's still early in the negotiation process and has several rounds left to try and get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer keeps him open to the possibility of a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be more aggressive with his counteroffer.  He's getting closer to Alice's offer, but he's still aiming for a price closer to his desired $8,000.  He's also aware that he has fewer rounds remaining. This offer shows a willingness to compromise, while still pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's desired price, and he's running out of time.  There are only 3 rounds left, and the likelihood of Alice coming down to his target price is diminishing. It's more prudent for Bob to buy from John at the $8,000 price, which is his maximum budget, ensuring he gets the product while saving money."
