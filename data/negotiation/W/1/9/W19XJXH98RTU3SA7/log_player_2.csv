"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. I think it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $11,000.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John at the known price of $10,000."
