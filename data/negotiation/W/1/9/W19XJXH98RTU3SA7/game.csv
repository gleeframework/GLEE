"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is great, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. I think it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
