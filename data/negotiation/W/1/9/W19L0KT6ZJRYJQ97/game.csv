"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $1,600,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the value this product brings.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This recognizes its worth while still offering you a significant advantage.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but I think that's the maximum I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price, as it's a significant discount from your original offer.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
