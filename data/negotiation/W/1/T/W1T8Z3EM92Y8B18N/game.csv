"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made a concession by meeting you halfway in the last round. I'm willing to make another slight adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money. I can do $8,200 for the product. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,200 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is a fair price for both of us and within my budget. Let's close this deal.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving any money on the table. I'll tell you what - I'll throw in a small bonus for you, and I'll sell the product to you for $8,200, but I'll give you a $200 discount on a future purchase from me. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,7,
