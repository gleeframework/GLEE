This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for you.  If Bob rejects, you can then gauge his interest and counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a bit more than John's price, but I'm still trying to save some money. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly below your minimum desired price of $10,000.  It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your target through further negotiation."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $8,500 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $9,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it would still be a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my offer and coming down to $9,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make another counteroffer. How about $8,750? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a bit higher.  You can likely get a better price by counteroffering again."
