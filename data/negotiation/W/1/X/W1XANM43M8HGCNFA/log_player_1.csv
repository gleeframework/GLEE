"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but one that still leaves room for negotiation and is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. This should encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price yet. I still have several rounds left to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, demonstrating flexibility. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired $12,000, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price.  I have several rounds left to negotiate and am willing to take the risk of getting a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, trying to meet Bob halfway.  This offer is still above my minimum and closer to his last offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, I have a few rounds left and I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000.  There is still room for a better deal, and I'm willing to take the risk of not accepting this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer, slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but closer to my desired price point. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as we're both getting closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $9,000, I only have two rounds left and there's no guarantee Bob will budge any further.  Selling to John would give me the minimum, but  $8,875 is a much better deal than $8,000. I'm accepting Bob's offer, as it's the best I can achieve with the remaining time."
