Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I still think $950,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm not willing to go up to $975,000. How about we meet in the middle at $962,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob seems firmly set at this price point. Accepting his offer of $962,500 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
