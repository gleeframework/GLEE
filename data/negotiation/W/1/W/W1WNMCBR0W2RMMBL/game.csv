"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $900,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still allows for a substantial profit for both of us. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand the value of the product and the profit margin you're aiming for. However, my budget constraints still prevent me from accepting $1,000,000. Could we possibly agree on a price closer to $850,000? This would allow for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
