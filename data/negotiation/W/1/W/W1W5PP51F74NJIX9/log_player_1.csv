"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation.  This shows I'm confident in the product's worth and willing to be flexible.  I'm hoping to secure a good price quickly, but I'm also prepared for counteroffers and potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than John's offer, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is still a significant profit for me and shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but it also demonstrates that I'm not going to give in too easily. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to sway Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,250,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway.  It's still a significant profit for me and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,250,000, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  Also, we're already on round 6, and I'm running out of time. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice to maximize my profits."
