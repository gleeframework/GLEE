"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet.  Bob's offer is too low, and I want to see if I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm reducing my price to $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value and shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is below my minimum value.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $11,000. This is still above my minimum value and demonstrates my willingness to compromise.  I believe this is a fair price considering the previous rounds of negotiation and the potential of selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,200 is still below my minimum value, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I could continue to counteroffer, there's no guarantee of a better deal, and the risk of losing both Bob and John as buyers is high.  Selling to John for $10,000 is the most secure option at this point, guaranteeing me a sale above my minimum value."
