"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $150.  Since Bob values the product at $120, I'm hoping this will encourage him to counteroffer, allowing us to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $140 is still higher than my minimum value of $150. I'd rather secure a sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for the same amount."
