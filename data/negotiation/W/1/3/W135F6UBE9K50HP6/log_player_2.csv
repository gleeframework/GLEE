"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $12,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **There are more rounds to go.** It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."

# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target. However, I'm also aware that we're getting close to the deadline, and I don't want to miss out on other opportunities. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000, but this is my final offer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she's calling it her ""final offer,"" it's still significantly above your target.
* **You're approaching the deadline.** This is your last chance to negotiate with Alice.  
* **Buying from John is a safer option.** You've been trying to get a lower price from Alice, but it's clear she's not willing to go much lower. You don't want to risk losing the product altogether and then having to pay John's higher price.

Given the situation, it's best to go with John's offer. You'll pay more than you originally hoped, but it's still within your budget and ensures you get the product."
