Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $8,000 would be a fair price for this product. It seems we are quite far apart in our valuations. I would like to stick to my original offer of $8,000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll consider purchasing the product from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is firm at $8,000 and even threatening to go to a competitor (although his mention of ""John"" seems like a negotiating tactic since you're the one with a buyer named John).  There's no indication he'll go higher. You have a guaranteed offer for $10,000 from John, which meets your minimum acceptable price.  It's time to cut your losses with Bob and take the sure thing."
