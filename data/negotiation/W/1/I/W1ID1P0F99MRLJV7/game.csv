"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives me a healthy profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get the best deal possible.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  How about $1,100,000? This would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but no higher. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",980000.0,Bob,6,
