Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

While $980,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than what I originally hoped for. At this point, it's better to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
