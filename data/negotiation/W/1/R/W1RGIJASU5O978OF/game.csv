"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the potential of the product,  $950,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you, while also being a bit more reasonable for you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a significant step towards your asking price and reflects the value I see in the product. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to budge too much from my original offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go down to $920,000. This is as low as I can go without sacrificing my profit margin. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
