"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product at a special price of $1,100,000. It's a one-time opportunity to own a truly unique item, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a bit high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round.  There is still room for negotiation before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, I'm looking to spend closer to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering your desired profit margin and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves room for a healthy profit for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target. Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to $950,000. There's still room for compromise, and rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation. Buying from John at this point would be a worse outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering your profit margin and my budget.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm still not ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a complimentary service package worth $20,000. This brings the total value of the deal to $1,020,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but Bob can still push for a lower price. The additional service package is a good incentive, but it doesn't make up for the difference in the product price. Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price, potentially by including the service package in his counteroffer. Buying from John at this point would be a worse outcome as the price is higher than the current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer and the added value of the service package. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. To make this work, I'm proposing a price of $1,010,000, which includes the service package. This way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1010000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're still keen on the service package, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,010,000, but I'll throw in an additional warranty extension that's worth $10,000. This brings the total value of the deal to $1,020,000. I think this is a fair compromise that meets both our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  The additional warranty extension, while not directly impacting the product's price, adds value to the deal. At this point, further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely, and buying from John would be a worse outcome.  Accepting the offer at $1,020,000 represents a good compromise and secures the product while remaining within Bob's budget."
