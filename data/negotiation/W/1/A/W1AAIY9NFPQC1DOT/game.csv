,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to go down to $9,800. That's a significant concession from my last offer, and it's a price that should work for both of us.  I really want to make this deal happen, but I can't go any lower.  Let me know what you think.",9800.0,Alice,7,
