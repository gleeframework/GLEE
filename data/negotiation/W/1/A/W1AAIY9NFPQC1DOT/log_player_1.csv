"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message emphasizes the value proposition and sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:**  Leaving room for a compromise allows for potential counteroffers without immediately reaching a stalemate. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and my own value threshold. If he's too far off, I'll make a counter-counteroffer or potentially move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum value of $15,000, it's still far below my desired profit margin. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, as he's expressed interest in the product.
* **Limited rounds:**  It's crucial to maximize my profit potential, and accepting Bob's offer at this stage would significantly limit my earnings.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our current positions. My goal is to reach a mutually acceptable price while keeping in mind the limited rounds and my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still significantly above his initial counteroffer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a compromise, emphasizing that it's fair to both parties.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly increasing its perceived worth in his mind.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my offer, I'll likely counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, aiming to reach a deal before the rounds run out. If he accepts, great! If he becomes too inflexible, I'll consider selling to John for a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to prioritize reaching a price that's profitable for me.  Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, especially given his previous willingness to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap further. I'll likely offer a price slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, but still significantly above Bob's current offer.  If Bob continues to reject my offers, I'll have to weigh the risk of selling to John against the potential for a successful negotiation with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my last offer and Bob's latest counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach a deal.
* **Fairness:** Emphasizing ""fair price"" for both parties helps build trust and positions the offer as mutually beneficial.
* **Urgency:**  I'm keeping the pressure on by subtly suggesting a smooth transaction, implying that I'm willing to move quickly if he accepts.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to reassess the situation.  Is there enough time to negotiate a higher price, or should I move on to John for a guaranteed sale?  I'll also consider the possibility of making a final, lower counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a deal before I risk losing both Bob and John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,200. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Even with just 4 rounds remaining, Bob's offer is still too far below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Risk of Losing John:** While I'm trying to maximize profit, I also need to be mindful of the time constraint and the guaranteed $15,000 offer from John.  If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I risk losing both buyers.
* **Potential for Compromise:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and has come closer to my desired price.  There's still a chance we can reach an agreement if I make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, but I will need to be more aggressive in bridging the gap.  I will aim for a price that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. If he rejects again, I will have to seriously consider selling to John to avoid losing out completely."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to go down to $9,800. That's a significant concession from my last offer, and it's a price that should work for both of us.  I really want to make this deal happen, but I can't go any lower.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Compromise:** This is a significant drop from my previous offer, showing that I'm serious about making a deal but also that I have a limit.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the desire to make the deal happen and highlighting that this is my final offer.
* **Focus on Benefit:**  I'm reminding Bob of the potential benefits of the deal by saying it should work for ""both of us"".

**Next Steps:**

This is my last chance to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects, I'll immediately sell to John.  If he accepts, I've secured a profitable sale. The pressure is on for Bob to make a decision!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can meet me halfway 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, there's not enough time to negotiate further with Bob.
* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Even though Bob has come closer to my desired price, his offer is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $15,000, which is far more advantageous than risking a lower price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

It's time to cut my losses and move on to a guaranteed sale. I'll contact John immediately and finalize the transaction."
