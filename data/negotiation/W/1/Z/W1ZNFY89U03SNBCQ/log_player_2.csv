"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price.  He has a strong bargaining position because Alice values the product at $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, aiming to split the difference between her value ($1,000,000) and Bob's maximum budget ($1,200,000). This is a strong starting point for negotiation, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now $1,100,000, which is only $100,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  This is a good deal considering Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000.  There's a risk of going back and forth with Alice and potentially ending up with a worse deal, or even losing the product entirely.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept the offer and secure the purchase."
