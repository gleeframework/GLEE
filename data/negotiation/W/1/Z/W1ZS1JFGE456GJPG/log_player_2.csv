# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
