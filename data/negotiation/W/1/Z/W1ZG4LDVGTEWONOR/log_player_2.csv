"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my product, which is worth $1,000,000 to you, for the incredible price of $1,100,000. This is a substantial discount from what I could get elsewhere, and it gives you the chance to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is less than Alice's offer of $1,100,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves you $100,000."
