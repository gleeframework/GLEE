"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price and still a great deal for you. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",975000.0,Bob,6,
