``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a price that offers a significant discount to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* This price also leaves room for negotiation, as it's still above Bob's estimated value of $800,000.
* By making a clear offer and providing a rationale, I hope to encourage Bob to consider my proposal and start a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe there's more room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore options that will bring me closer to my desired price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price and still a great deal for you. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000** is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It reflects a willingness to negotiate while still staying within my acceptable range.

* By highlighting the discount from my initial price, I aim to demonstrate my flexibility and willingness to reach a fair agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,025,000** is the midpoint between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's latest offer of $950,000. This demonstrates a commitment to finding a compromise.
* The message is positive and emphasizes the fairness of the offer for both parties. It also re-iterates my desire to finalize the deal. 
* By proposing a specific price and clearly stating my willingness to make a final compromise, I hope to encourage Bob to accept the offer and conclude the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already made significant concessions and I'm not confident that further negotiation will result in a price that meets my needs.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to guarantee a profitable sale and avoid further potential losses in negotiation."
