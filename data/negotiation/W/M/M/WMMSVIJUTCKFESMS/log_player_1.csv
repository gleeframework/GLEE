"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price and the negotiation is taking time. It's better to secure a sale now rather than risk further rounds and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John."
