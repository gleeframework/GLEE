"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $135. This is a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to Bob ($120), it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for $120, saving him $15."
