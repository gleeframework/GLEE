"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value in the current market.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This price reflects a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. It's my final offer - let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
