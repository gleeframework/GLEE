"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $800,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the value it will bring you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,150,000. Can you consider this price?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
