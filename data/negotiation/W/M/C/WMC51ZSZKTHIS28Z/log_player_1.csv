"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save a bit more if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?"", ""product_price"": 13250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether.
