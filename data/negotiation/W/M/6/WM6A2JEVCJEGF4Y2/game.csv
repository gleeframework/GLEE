"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $7,500.  It's a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",7500.0,Bob,4,
