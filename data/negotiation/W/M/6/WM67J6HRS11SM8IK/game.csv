"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $15,000 for the product. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value the product holds for you, and I'd like to meet you in the middle. My revised offer is $14,000 for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $13,000, which is a good middle ground. This allows you to make a profit while I can acquire the product within my budget. Let's try to reach a deal at this price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking that since we're so close to the product's value to you, I could make one more concession. My revised offer is $13,500 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, and it brings me closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $13,500 is a great offer. However, I'm hoping we can bridge the gap just a little further. If you're willing to come down to $13,000, we can finalize the deal. This would ensure a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to acquire the product within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,6,
