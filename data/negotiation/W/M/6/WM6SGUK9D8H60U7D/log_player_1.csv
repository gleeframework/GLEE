I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $12,500. While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than what John is offering, and it's reasonable considering the back and forth negotiations.  I'm confident I can find another buyer for my next product."
