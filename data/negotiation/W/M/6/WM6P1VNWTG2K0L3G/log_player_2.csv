Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value to you is closer to $12,000, which is what I initially thought. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price that balances both our interests.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll meet you at $12,500, which is still above what you're willing to pay, but closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
