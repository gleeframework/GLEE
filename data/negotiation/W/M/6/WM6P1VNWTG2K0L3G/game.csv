"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value to you is closer to $12,000, which is what I initially thought. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price that balances both our interests.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit in price.  However, $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll meet you at $12,500, which is still above what you're willing to pay, but closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",12500.0,Alice,5,
