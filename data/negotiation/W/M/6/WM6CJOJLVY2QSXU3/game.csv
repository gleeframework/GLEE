"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product brings. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This price still allows you significant profit, while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.  Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do even better. I'm thinking $925,000 is a good starting point, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target price. Can we discuss further and see if we can meet in the middle?",925000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $925,000 is closer, but we're still a bit apart.  Let's compromise at $940,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?",940000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,920000.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm getting closer to my target, but I still think $920,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $915,000. Let's see if we can make a deal!",915000.0,Bob,6,,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm going to stick with $930,000, which is only $15,000 from your last offer. This is a fair price for the value this product brings. Let's close this deal and move forward!",930000.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,910000.0
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with $915,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",915000.0,Bob,8,,
