"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value to you is higher than that. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your flexibility. $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price considering I'm really interested in the product and we're already close to a deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but I think the product's value to you is higher than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9,250. I'm confident you'll love the product, and I'm willing to make a deal with you at this price. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
