"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $150. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to go any higher.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $200. I think it's a fair price for a product of this quality.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $180, but no higher. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",180.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $180, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm counteroffering $220. I think it's a fair price, considering the product's value and what I've learned about your budget so far.",220.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still looking for a bit more, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to go up to $190, but that's as high as I can go. I think it's still a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",190.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $190, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering $210. I think it's a fair price, considering the product's value and what we've discussed so far.",210.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to make one more compromise, but I'm really struggling to go above $190. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $190 and $210, so I'm counteroffering $200. I think it's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $200. I'm willing to make one final compromise, so I'm counteroffering $220, but I'll throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal.
