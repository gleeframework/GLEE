"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price of $120, it's still worth exploring further negotiation. I believe I can get a better price than $100, and I have 8 more rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? I'm confident you'll find this price fair."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a valuable product, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my minimum desired price of $120.  While I would prefer to get closer to $120, I have to balance that with the risk of losing the deal altogether. With only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly likely that I won't get a better offer from Bob. Accepting his offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
