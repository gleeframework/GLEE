"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $100 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow me to make a reasonable profit.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $97.50 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $96, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",96.0,Bob,6,
