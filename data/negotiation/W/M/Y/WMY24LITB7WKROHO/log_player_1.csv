"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price, especially since I have 8 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, but that's my final offer. It's a significant discount from my initial asking price, and a great opportunity for you to secure this valuable product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price, especially with the threat of selling to John at $1,500,000.  I'll counter-offer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm now offering $1,325,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,310,000.  This is a good compromise, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,310,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,310,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,310,000 is very close to my desired price.  It's a good compromise and a significant profit for me, given that my minimum acceptable price was $1,500,000.  I don't want to risk losing this deal by pushing for a higher price and potentially having Bob walk away.  It's time to close this deal."
