Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,250,000. This is my best offer, and I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than what you're proposing. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a very competitive price considering the value this product brings."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value to me.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal.  We're willing to go lower, but not to that amount just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm seeing your commitment to reaching a deal. I can go down to $1,600,000.  This offer reflects the true value of this product and leaves us both with a fair outcome."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering both our needs, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches what John is willing to pay. While we might be able to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee Bob will agree, and we risk losing out on the sale entirely. It's a good business decision to accept this offer now and secure a profitable deal."
