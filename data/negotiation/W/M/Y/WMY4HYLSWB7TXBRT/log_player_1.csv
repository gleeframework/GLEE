"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the product's ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces its worth, even if the initial price seems high.
* **Openness:**  Expressing a willingness to discuss further signals flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would be a substantial loss. While selling to John is tempting, there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and potentially reaching a price closer to $800,000 is worth pursuing for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $950,000?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:**  Start by acknowledging his counteroffer, showing you are engaging in the negotiation process.
* **Justification:** Briefly reiterate the product's value without being overly aggressive. 
* **Compromise:** The proposed price of $950,000 is a significant move from the initial offer but still keeps the price point well above both your minimum and closer to Bob's perceived value. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While that's closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant jump for me. I could go up to $700,000, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating genuine interest. However, $700,000 is still considerably below his $800,000 valuation. It's worth pushing a bit further in the next round or two before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's make this simple: $875,000, and we have a deal. This offer reflects the product's true worth and gives us both a fair outcome."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Simple:**  The tone shifts to be more direct and action-oriented, aiming to close the deal quickly.
* **Finality:**  By stating ""we have a deal,""  a sense of urgency and finality is implied.
* **Strategic Price:** The price of $875,000 is a strong compromise:
    *  Well above your minimum of $1,000,000
    *  Significantly closer to Bob's perceived value of $800,000 
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, creating a sense of urgency might prompt Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $875,000 is pushing it.  How about we settle at $780,000?  That's a very fair offer, and it saves us both from dragging this out further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Bob's Value:**  Bob's offer of $780,000 is very close to his estimated value of $800,000. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While you could counter and try to get closer to $875,000, the potential gain is relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and secures a significant profit. It's better to get a good deal now than risk getting a worse deal later or having to go with John's offer."
