"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While that's closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant jump for me. I could go up to $700,000, but that's my limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's make this simple: $875,000, and we have a deal. This offer reflects the product's true worth and gives us both a fair outcome.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $875,000 is pushing it.  How about we settle at $780,000?  That's a very fair offer, and it saves us both from dragging this out further.",780000.0,Bob,6,
