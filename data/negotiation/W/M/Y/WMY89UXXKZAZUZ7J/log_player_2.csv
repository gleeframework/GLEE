"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $120, which is above Bob's maximum budget of $150.
* **Better option:** Reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to lower her price.  There are 9 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $120, which is too high.
* **Counteroffer:**  $100, a significant discount that is still within Bob's budget. This shows Bob is serious about buying but is also trying to get a good deal. 
* **Next steps:**  This counteroffer puts the ball back in Alice's court, and gives her an opportunity to accept or reject.  There's still room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $110, which is within Bob's budget of $150. 
* **Counteroffer:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject again, and he could end up buying from John for $150.
* **Decision:**  Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product for a price he's comfortable with, saving him $40 compared to buying from John."
