Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's worth more to me to continue negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  It's worth much more than that to me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1,250,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, I still believe the product is worth more.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is still below what I believe the product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.
