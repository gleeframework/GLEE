Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  It's worth much more than that to me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1,250,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is still below what I believe the product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down, it's clear she's unlikely to go as low as John's $1,000,000 offer. Cutting my losses and going with John guarantees I get the product at the best possible price for me."
