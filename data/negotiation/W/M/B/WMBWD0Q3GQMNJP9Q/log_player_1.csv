Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring you get a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the deal goes through with Bob, avoiding the need to sell it for less to John."
