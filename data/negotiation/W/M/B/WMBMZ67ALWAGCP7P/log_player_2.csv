"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if you can get a lower price from Alice.  You can always fall back to buying from John if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount.  This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and sets a lower price point for further discussions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, but I believe we can still do better.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a lower price closer to my initial counteroffer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $1,050,000.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still aim for a price closer to my initial counteroffer. It's a reasonable midpoint between my last offer and hers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,050,000.  This is a good price and a significant saving compared to buying from John. Further negotiation might get me a few thousand dollars less, but the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and then potentially increasing her price again is too high. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
