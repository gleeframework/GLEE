"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this offer is acceptable.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still gives you a significant discount and leaves me some room to profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too far below my target. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,5,
