Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $95, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $95 is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Showing flexibility:**  Adding the ""open to negotiation"" statement signals that I'm willing to work with Bob, making him more likely to accept or counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I have another buyer for $80 keeps me from negotiating too low if Bob is being unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price.  This will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price for the product and hopefully lead to a more favorable outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you're interested, Bob.  While $80 is my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my original asking price of $95. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? "", ""product_price"": 87.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Offering $87.50 shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Reminding of the original price:**  Mentioning my original price of $95 subtly reminds Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale and I believe the product is worth more.
* **Positive language:** Using phrases like ""appreciate you're interested"" and ""split the difference"" keeps the conversation amicable and increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $85. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's counteroffer of $85 is only $5 less than my last offer and is still significantly above my minimum of $80.  Given that John is only willing to pay $80, accepting Bob's offer is the most profitable decision in this scenario.  It's a good compromise that allows me to maximize my earnings without risking losing the sale to John."
