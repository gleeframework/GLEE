"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10000, but I have to make a profit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13500 for the product. Can we discuss further?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $11500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $14000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $12500, which is a fair price considering the concessions we've both made. If we can find common ground here, I'm ready to close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're really committed to making this happen.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $13000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $13000. I can offer it to you for $13250. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",13250.0,Alice,9,
