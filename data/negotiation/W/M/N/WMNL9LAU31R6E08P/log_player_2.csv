{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You can do better than $100. You're willing to pay up to $80, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2

I'm offering the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let's see if Alice is willing to come down."

Alice is getting closer to my price, but I can still try to get it down further. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get her to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is still too high. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate, but I'm also getting close to my limit.  I might buy from John soon if I don't see progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}

I'm going to try one more time with a counteroffer. $87 is close to my limit, but if I can get her to accept it, I'll save a few bucks compared to buying from John."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is not budging. I've made my best offers, and she's not willing to meet me in the middle. I'm running out of time and rounds, so I'll buy from John. It's not the absolute best price, but it's within my budget and I'll have the product."
