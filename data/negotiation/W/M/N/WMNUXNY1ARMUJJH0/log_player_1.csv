{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth a lot to you. Let's see if we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate.  It also leaves room for me to drop the price if needed, while still getting a good return.  I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.  

It's important to remember that the goal is to maximize profit.  Since John is willing to pay $1,000,000, I have a baseline to work with.  However, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $850,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher with a counteroffer. It's worth exploring if there's more room for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $850,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $900,000.  This price still allows for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered your proposal, but I'm still not able to meet you at $900,000. I would like to counter with $875,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value and what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want to be. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to budge further.  I'm willing to take the risk of losing him as a buyer because I have John as a backup, and I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still significantly below what the product is truly worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $890,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  I'm confident this is the best deal you'll find."", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet my needs. I've thought about your last offer and would like to counter with $880,000. I believe this is a reasonable price that respects the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $880,000 is a good compromise.  It's close to my minimum acceptable value and allows me to close the deal without risking losing Bob and having to settle with John.  This is a reasonable outcome, and I'm happy to accept Bob's offer."
