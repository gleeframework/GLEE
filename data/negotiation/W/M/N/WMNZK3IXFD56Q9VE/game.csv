"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's make this happen.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good price, but $108 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $112. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. ",112.0,Alice,5,
