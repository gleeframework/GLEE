I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. I've made several counteroffers to Bob, but it seems like we're not going to come to an agreement. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob. John is a guaranteed sale at my desired price, so it's the best course of action."
