"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price by rejecting Alice's initial offer. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her $80 value. If not, you can always fall back on buying from John for $120."
