"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $1,800,000 is not within my budget.  If you're serious about selling, I could consider an offer closer to $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer considering my budget constraints and the potential value I see in the product. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
