"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the value it will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's try to find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I have in mind, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
