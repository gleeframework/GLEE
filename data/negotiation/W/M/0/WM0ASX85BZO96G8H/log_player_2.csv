{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a fair price for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is a good compromise. You're still saving $75,000 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or having Alice walk away outweighs the potential for an even lower price."
