"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a fair price for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",725000.0,Alice,3,
