"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for an item of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While I know Bob values the product at $800,000, I'm starting significantly higher to leave room for negotiation. This anchors the negotiation closer to my desired outcome.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""unique potential"" and calling it a ""fair starting point,"" I'm framing the high price as justified by the product's value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions ""bidding,"" making it clear I'm open to negotiation and counteroffers.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** Secure a price as close to my valuation as possible.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will indicate how badly he wants the product and how flexible he might be on price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant jump from his initial valuation, it's still substantially lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of losing out on a significant portion of the product's value to me. 

By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price and am willing to walk away from the deal if necessary. This keeps the door open for further negotiation and a potentially more favorable counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with an offer.  To be frank, $950,000 is a bit below what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and to make this work, I'd need to see it closer to $1,050,000.  I'm confident that at this price point, it would be an excellent investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've come down from my initial offer, but not drastically. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the ""significant value"" the product offers, subtly anchoring Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Framing as Investment:**  Positioning the purchase as an ""investment"" subtly minimizes the perception of a high price, instead emphasizing potential returns.
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Power:** I'm not overly eager, keeping the option of John's offer on the table if Bob doesn't meet my expectations in the next round or two."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to my walk-away point and above his initial valuation. While I could push for a slightly higher amount, the risk of him walking away and losing out on this substantial profit outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal.  

Accepting this offer secures a $225,000 profit over Bob's initial valuation and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
