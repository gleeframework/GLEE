"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

While Alice has reduced her price, it's still too high for my budget. I need to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in this product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my budget. While there's room for continued negotiation, I'm running out of rounds.  It's becoming increasingly likely we won't reach an agreement. To avoid the risk of losing the opportunity altogether, I'm going to purchase the product from John for $800,000.  This is a guaranteed purchase and within my budget."
