You can do better than $10,000. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering its value to you.

While $10,500 is a better price than John's offer, it's still worth trying to negotiate lower. You have room to move before reaching your limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,750. I'm willing to go slightly higher, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm thinking $11,000 could be a sweet spot for both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $11,000 is closer to your limit, but you can still try to negotiate lower.  It's worth one more counteroffer to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,500 is getting too close to your limit, and it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price.  Since John is selling the product for $12,000, it's more efficient to buy from him and avoid further negotiations."
