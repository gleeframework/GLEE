"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering its value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,750. I'm willing to go slightly higher, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm thinking $11,000 could be a sweet spot for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your minimum value.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we settle at $10,250? This would be a fair compromise and still allow you to achieve a good price.",10250.0,Bob,6,
