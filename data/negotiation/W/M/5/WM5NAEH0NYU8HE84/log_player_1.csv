Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's 50% higher than my minimum value. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a decent profit. I'm confident I can still negotiate a higher price if Bob shows interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm confident I can get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over John's offer. It's also getting closer to my initial offer, and further negotiation might not be worth the time."
