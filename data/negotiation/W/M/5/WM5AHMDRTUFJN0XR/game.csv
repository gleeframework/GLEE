"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $10,500?  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500. How about $9,950?",9950.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,950 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and agree on $10,200. It's a fair price for both of us. ",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,200. How about $9,850?",9850.0,Bob,6,
