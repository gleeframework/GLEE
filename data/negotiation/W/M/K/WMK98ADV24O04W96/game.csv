"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we settle at $1,400,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
