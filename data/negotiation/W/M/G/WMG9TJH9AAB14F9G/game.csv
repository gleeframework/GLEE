"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's keep working towards a mutually agreeable price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute limit.  This price reflects the value of the product and ensures we both get a good deal.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
