Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 undervalues the product's unique capabilities and the long-term benefits it offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's make it $1,000,000. This is my final offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair compromise considering our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to Bob's perceived value, but we're still significantly below our minimum. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can get closer to $1 million."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementing his offers in smaller amounts, signaling he's unlikely to reach our desired price point. We've given it a fair shot, and it's now more profitable to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
