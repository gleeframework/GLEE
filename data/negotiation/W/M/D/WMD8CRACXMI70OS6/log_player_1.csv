Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.  It's a strong opening position that will hopefully encourage Bob to counteroffer.  I'm also aware that I have John as a backup, so I'm not desperate to close this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still significantly above Bob's initial offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  John's offer guarantees me a good deal, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiations with Bob that could potentially result in a lower price."
