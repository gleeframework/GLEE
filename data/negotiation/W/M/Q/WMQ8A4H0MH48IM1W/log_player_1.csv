"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high sets a strong baseline and allows for potential negotiation room.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's potential benefit to Bob emphasizes its worth.
* **Open Communication:**  The message encourages Bob to engage and express his thoughts, potentially revealing his level of interest. 

**Strategy:**

By opening with a high offer, I aim to gauge Bob's seriousness and potential budget.  I'll adapt my strategy based on his response. If he rejects, I'll consider lowering the price slightly, but not too drastically, to maintain leverage.  I'll also be prepared to accept John's offer of $800,000 if necessary, ensuring I don't lose out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. I would like to propose a price of $950000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly closer to my desired price point. Accepting this offer secures a favorable sale and prevents the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price. 

**Strategy:**

While I initially aimed for $1,000,000,  $950,000 is a strong compromise. Accepting now ensures a good profit while mitigating the risk of lower counteroffers in subsequent rounds. There's also a chance that Bob might be willing to negotiate further, but the potential for a less favorable outcome outweighs the potential for a slight increase in price."
