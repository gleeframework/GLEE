"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $975,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is my final offer before I start to get concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience. I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. To be completely transparent, $1,000,000 is the very highest I can go. If you can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I understand, and I wish you the best in selling the product.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
