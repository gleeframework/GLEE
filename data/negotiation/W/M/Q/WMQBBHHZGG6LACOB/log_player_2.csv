Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty, and I'm glad we've had a good conversation. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is firm:** She's stated twice that $1,050,000 is her final offer. Pushing further might make her walk away.
* **Good Deal:**  You're already getting a $450,000 discount from John's price and a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. 
* **Time:** You're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Continuing the back and forth might lead to a stalemate. 

While getting a lower price is ideal, accepting now secures the product at a very favorable price."
