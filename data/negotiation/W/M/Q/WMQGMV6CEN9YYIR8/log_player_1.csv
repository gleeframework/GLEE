"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than what Bob values the product at, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product, hoping to make the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation, which is important in a multi-round scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $12,000.
* **Negotiation strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I can maintain control of the negotiation and potentially extract a better price in the next round.
* **Risk assessment:** While selling to John is guaranteed at $12,000, I'm willing to take a calculated risk to see if I can achieve a more favorable outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm counteroffering with a price in between Bob's offer and my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining my position:** My counteroffer is still significantly higher than what Bob initially offered, indicating I haven't completely conceded.
* **Framing as a win-win:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise and a mutually beneficial solution, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I believe we can reach an even better agreement. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the deal:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price and is likely the best deal I can get with him. 
* **Time constraint:** With only 6 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting the offer guarantees a sale and avoids the potential of a lower offer in future rounds or the need to sell to John.

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal of $12,000, accepting this offer secures a profit and minimizes the risk of a worse outcome."
