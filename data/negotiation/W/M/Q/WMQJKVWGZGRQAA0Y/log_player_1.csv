"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and while it's tempting to take the $950,000, I believe I can do better. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $1,025,000.  That's a significant value for you, and it gives us both room to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,012,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer once more to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down to $1,018,750. This is a very fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let's seal this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1018750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,018,750 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,009,375. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,009,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,009,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still not worth it to me.  While $1,009,375 is tempting, I'm running out of rounds and it's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  I'm going to sell to John."
