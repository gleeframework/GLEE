Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down while still staying above your desired profit margin.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. If he flat out rejects this high price, you know he's looking for a much lower price point.
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have John as a backup buyer at $15,000. This gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches what John is offering, there's still room for negotiation. Bob is willing to pay $15,000, which is $3,000 more than his initial perceived value. This suggests he might be willing to go a bit higher.  We'll try to push for a slightly better deal before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $15,000 is a bit lower than I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer suggests a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:**  The $18,000 price point keeps the negotiation significantly more profitable than selling to John. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for Bob to counter again if he's really interested, potentially reaching a price point that's a win-win for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $16,000 is a good deal. It's a full $1,000 more than John's offer and significantly more than Bob initially valued the product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting now secures a solid profit. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Extended negotiations can be tiring. Accepting this offer ends the negotiation on a positive note and allows you to move on."
