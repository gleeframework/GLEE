This offer is above my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to Bob's perceived value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $12000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I am able to offer $12200 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,200 is only slightly below my counteroffer of $12,500, and it's still a good amount above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It's in my best interest to accept this offer and finalize the sale."
