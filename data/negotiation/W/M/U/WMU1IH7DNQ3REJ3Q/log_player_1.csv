We're still significantly above John's offer.  Bob is clearly interested and we have room to negotiate before going below our fallback."

We're getting close, but we're still above John's offer. Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's still interested. We need to push him a little further before considering accepting."

Bob is likely to continue incrementally increasing his offer, but the gains are getting smaller. Accepting his offer of $860,000 makes the most sense now as it's a substantial amount above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
