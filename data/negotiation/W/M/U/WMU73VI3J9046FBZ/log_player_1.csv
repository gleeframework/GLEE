Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $600,000. Let me know if that works for you.

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we seem to be hitting a wall here. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, the gap between our positions is still quite large. My last offer is $750,000. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to pursue other options.

Bob is unlikely to budge significantly from his last offer.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer for $1,500,000."
