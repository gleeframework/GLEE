"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $600,000. Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,750,000. This reflects the product's unique benefits. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $1,750,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with.  To be frank, my absolute top end is closer to $700,000.  If that's not doable, we may need to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $700,000 is too far from what I can accept.  Let's try a compromise - how about $1,400,000? This feels like a fair offer considering the value the product brings.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we seem to be hitting a wall here. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, the gap between our positions is still quite large. My last offer is $750,000. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to pursue other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
