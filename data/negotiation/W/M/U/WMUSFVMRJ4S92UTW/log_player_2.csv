{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I find the current price a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,050,000. I believe this offer reflects a fair value for both of us."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After reviewing the market value and the product's potential, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth and is still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:**  By saying $1,250,000 is ""closer,"" we signal flexibility without jumping at her offer.
* **Target a Range, Not Just One Number:** Aiming for ""closer to $1,100,000"" gives us wiggle room if Alice counters again.
* **Open-Ended Question:** ""Meet me somewhere in the middle?"" encourages Alice to make a move without us having to propose another specific number."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth and is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has matched John's price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate or going with John since the price will be the same.  Accepting now secures the deal."
