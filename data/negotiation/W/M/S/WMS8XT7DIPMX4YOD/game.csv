"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $10,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10250.0,Alice,5,
