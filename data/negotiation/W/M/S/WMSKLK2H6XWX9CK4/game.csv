"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a fair price for a product of this quality, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can we meet in the middle?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value and quality of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $700,000. Can we make a deal at this price?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $700,000 is still below what this product is worth. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price, considering both the value of the product and your budget. Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $800,000, which is the price I can afford. I'll offer $825,000. Can we make a deal at this price?",825000.0,Bob,6,
