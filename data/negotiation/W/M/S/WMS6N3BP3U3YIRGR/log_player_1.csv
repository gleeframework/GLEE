Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price might lead to a quicker sale and still nets a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $119 is just below my guaranteed sale price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This makes it more likely he'll perceive it as a good deal and accept. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy aims to maximize the potential profit while still ensuring I can sell the product for its minimum value."
