"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $9,750?  I think that's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,250? I think this is the best compromise we can reach.",10250.0,Alice,5,
