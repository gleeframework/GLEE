# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. My starting price is $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $650,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $650,000 is below my ideal price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $850,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit while also giving you a great deal. Let's continue this discussion and see if we can find a meeting point.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue working with you. However, $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $787,500? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate towards a middle ground. While you could try for an even lower price, $787,500 is a good deal and significantly less than both your maximum budget and John's offer. Accepting now avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down and ensures you get the product."
