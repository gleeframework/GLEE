"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. My starting price is $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $650,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $650,000 is below my ideal price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $850,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit while also giving you a great deal. Let's continue this discussion and see if we can find a meeting point.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $725,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue working with you. However, $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $787,500? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let me know what you think.",787500.0,Alice,5,
