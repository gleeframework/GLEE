"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I've already made several concessions, and I need to get the price I'm looking for. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1050000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
