"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this opportunity. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Alice's offer. Alice's offer is $300,000 less than the value of the product to me, so I can do better by buying from John for the market price.
