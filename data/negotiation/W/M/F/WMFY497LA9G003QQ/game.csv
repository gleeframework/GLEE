"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to start with an offer of $1400000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your understanding of the product's potential value to my business. While I'm interested, $1400000 is unfortunately a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value to me.  I believe this is a good starting point for us to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a new price of $1325000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1325000 is still outside my comfort zone.  To reach an agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to securing this product. Let's work together to close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1300000. Considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a new price of $1285000. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, but still reflects the product's worth to you.",1285000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, your offer of $1285000 is getting very close to what I can afford. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $1275000.
