{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $15,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen $15,000 as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I've kept the message friendly and open to discussion. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little bit away from my target price. How about $13,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm proposing $13,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $13000 is still a little high for me. How about $11000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $11,000 is tempting, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $12,000, which is a significant price drop from my initial offer.  This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident it's a good deal for you too.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm lowering the price to $12,000, which is still above my minimum and closer to Bob's last offer.  I've emphasized the price reduction to show flexibility, and I've included a statement about the value of the deal for both of us to encourage him to accept. Let's see if this final offer convinces Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate. I really appreciate it. I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $11500? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer $12,000, $11,500 is still a good deal for me, especially since Bob is showing a clear intention to finalize the deal.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks losing the sale completely.  At this point, it's better to secure the deal and move forward."
