Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is very valuable to you.  I'm asking for $13,000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $13,000, which is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product has for Bob to increase the chances of a successful negotiation.
* **Open to counteroffers:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **John as a backup:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, so I won't be overly aggressive in my negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $11,000?  That's still a good price for you and a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $11,000 is a good deal for Bob, it's still below my minimum of $10,000.  I cannot accept this offer.
* **Potential for better outcome:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob through further negotiation.  
* **John as a safety net:**  Even if I reject Bob's offer, I have John as a fallback option, which gives me some leverage in negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial asking price.  How about $12,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not drastically lowering my price, but I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving from $13,000 to $12,000. 
* **Highlight the value:** I'm reminding Bob that even $12,000 is still a great deal for him, considering the product's value.
* **Focus on a middle ground:** I'm explicitly aiming for a middle ground to create a sense of fairness and encourage agreement. 
* **Keep John in mind:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not desperate. I know I can sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob won't meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $11,500 is just slightly below my minimum, but it's still a good deal for me considering the potential to get a higher price is now uncertain.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a better price. Bob might be firm on his offer.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, potentially leading to a stalemate.
* **Safety net:** I still have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if the deal with Bob falls through. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a good price and move on, minimizing the risk and effort involved."
