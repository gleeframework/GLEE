"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is still below what I believe the product is worth.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant discount.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
