Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly message makes Bob feel more comfortable and encourages him to engage.
* **Open-ended question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation.

This strategy aims to establish a high starting point while also showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  Since I can sell to John for $120, there's no reason to continue negotiating. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid any potential delays."
