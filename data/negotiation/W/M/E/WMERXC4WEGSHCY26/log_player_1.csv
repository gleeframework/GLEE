Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($150) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $130 offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal, while still keeping me well above my minimum acceptable price ($80). 
* **Alternative Option:**  I am aware that I have John as a backup buyer at $80, which gives me leverage in the negotiation. I won't accept anything below $80 from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend a little less. Would you be willing to sell it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent profit, I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  He's clearly interested in the product. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm looking for a higher price and open the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession & Compromise:** I've come down from my initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate.  
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  This framing technique often feels fair to both parties and encourages agreement. 
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  $120 still provides a substantial profit margin above my minimum ($80). 
* **John in Reserve:**  I still have John as a fallback option if Bob rejects this offer and we can't reach a mutually agreeable price."
