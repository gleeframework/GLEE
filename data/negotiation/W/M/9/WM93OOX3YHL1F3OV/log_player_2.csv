It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further.  Even a small decrease in price will be beneficial."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a decent profit for her, and it gives me a good starting point for negotiations."

Alice has come down a bit, but I think I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer again."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but still try to stay well below Alice's last offer.  This shows I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm not willing to overpay."

Alice has come down to $960,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's getting close to my limit with John.  It's better to secure a deal at this price than to risk losing out to John."
