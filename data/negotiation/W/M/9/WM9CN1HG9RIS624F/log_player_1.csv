{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and gives me a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also frames the offer as beneficial to both of us, which can make Bob more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $11,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $11,750 is still a bit lower than I hoped, it's a better deal than selling to John and getting $10,000. It also seems like Bob is pretty firm on his price, so I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation."
