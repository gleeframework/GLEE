"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and gives me a fair profit. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $11,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",11750.0,Bob,4,
