"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to find it for a little less. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
