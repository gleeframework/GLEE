``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's slightly lower than my minimum desired price ($15,000), but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to secure a sale quickly, but I'm also prepared to negotiate with Bob or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum desired price of $15,000 and even below the value of the product to him ($12,000).  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Bob's offer:
