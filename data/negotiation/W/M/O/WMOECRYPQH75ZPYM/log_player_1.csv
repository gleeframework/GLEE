Round 2

# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget.

While $8,200 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $8,800 to make this work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8800}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,800, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,400. Can you consider that?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,600. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is my absolute limit. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to a deal with Bob, I've now reached a point where I'm not sure if further negotiation will lead to a significantly better outcome. John is offering a guaranteed $10,000, which is closer to my desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation. I will sell the product to John."
