Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product for a price of $1,800,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe the value it holds will greatly exceed your investment. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I want to start high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer helps me gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  The high price leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 

It's important to note that while John provides a safety net, my goal is to maximize profit. This strategy aims to achieve that while still securing a sale."
