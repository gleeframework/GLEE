"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique features and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for the product. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your desired price point, the value this product brings simply can't be matched at $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still quite a stretch for my budget.  Could you consider $12,000? That's a significant amount and reflects my genuine interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's aim for a win-win. Would you consider $16,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm seeing a pattern here and I'm not sure we're going to find a number that works for both of us. To be completely upfront, $13,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob has signaled that $13,000 is his absolute limit. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap between his offer and your minimum price. Accepting John's guaranteed $15,000 makes more sense than risking a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
