"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique features and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for the product. Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your desired price point, the value this product brings simply can't be matched at $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still quite a stretch for my budget.  Could you consider $12,000? That's a significant amount and reflects my genuine interest in the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's aim for a win-win. Would you consider $16,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget constraints.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm seeing a pattern here and I'm not sure we're going to find a number that works for both of us. To be completely upfront, $13,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
