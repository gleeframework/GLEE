# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. There's room to negotiate a better price. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive deal."
