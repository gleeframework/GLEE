"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I can only go as low as $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000. I can offer you $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
