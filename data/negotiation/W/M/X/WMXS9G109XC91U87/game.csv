"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me and your desire to sell it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $10,500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
