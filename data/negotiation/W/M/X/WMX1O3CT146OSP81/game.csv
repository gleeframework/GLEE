"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I believe it's a bit low considering the value of the product to me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This represents a significant discount for you while still allowing me to secure this asset at a price I'm comfortable with. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $1,050,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to secure the asset at a discounted price while giving me a reasonable return on my investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to close the deal on this offer.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not ready to accept $1,075,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,090,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to secure the asset at a discounted price while giving me a reasonable return on my investment.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
