Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I believe it's a bit low considering the value of the product to me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This represents a significant discount for you while still allowing me to secure this asset at a price I'm comfortable with. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
