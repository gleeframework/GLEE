"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,200,000). Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate and can potentially save a substantial amount by rejecting the initial offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I believe it's a bit low considering the value of the product to me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This represents a significant discount for you while still allowing me to secure this asset at a price I'm comfortable with. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $1,050,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to secure the asset at a discounted price while giving me a reasonable return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has several rounds left and can potentially secure a better deal by rejecting the current offer and counter-offering again.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to close the deal on this offer."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not ready to accept $1,075,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,090,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to secure the asset at a discounted price while giving me a reasonable return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,090,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,075,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible, and the price might increase again.  It's more advantageous for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a significant discount compared to buying from John.  Furthermore, with only five rounds remaining, there's less opportunity to further reduce the price."
