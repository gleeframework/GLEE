"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure the price is right.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $825000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $825000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $762500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the transaction.",762500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $800000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $780000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",780000.0,Bob,6,
