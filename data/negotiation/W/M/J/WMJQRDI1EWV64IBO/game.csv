"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $5000 to $8000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $6000 is below the minimum price I'm willing to consider. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $12000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, based on my research and understanding of the market, I believe the product's true value lies between $5000 and $8000.

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I still believe the product's unique features and benefits justify a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you the product for $10000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope it's more in line with your expectations.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints and the current market conditions, I would like to propose an offer of $8000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $8000 is still below the minimum price I'm willing to consider. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $9500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope it's more in line with your expectations.",9500.0,Alice,7,
