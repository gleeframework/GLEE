"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my valuation and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still gives you a good value considering your valuation of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to offer $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and  demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
