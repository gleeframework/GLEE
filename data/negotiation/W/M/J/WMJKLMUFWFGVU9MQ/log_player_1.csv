Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my valuation and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum price.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still gives you a good value considering your valuation of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to offer $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and  demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely we won't get much closer. Accepting his offer is the best choice at this point."
