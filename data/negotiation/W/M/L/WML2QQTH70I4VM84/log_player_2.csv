"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can do better than $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $10,500 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You are still better off than buying from John, but you should still try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's compromise at $11,000. That would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? This is a compromise that should work for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice. You are getting the product for $11,750, which is significantly less than the $15,000 you would pay John. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept your counteroffer, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
