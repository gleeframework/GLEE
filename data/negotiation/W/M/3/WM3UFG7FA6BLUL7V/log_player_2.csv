"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm asking for $1,190,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high and you're willing to walk away. This might lead her to counter-offer with a lower price. Even if she doesn't, you're still guaranteed the product at a better price from John."
