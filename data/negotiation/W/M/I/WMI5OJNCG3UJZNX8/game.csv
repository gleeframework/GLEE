"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? I'm really interested in your product, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $88.50? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both, and we can close the deal quickly.",88.5,Bob,4,
