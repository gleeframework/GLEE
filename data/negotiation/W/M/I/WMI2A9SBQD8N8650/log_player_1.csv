"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not outrageous):**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and potentially lets me secure a deal closer to my desired price. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""potential"" and ""benefits"" of the product, I aim to frame the high price as justified rather than arbitrary. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open, indicating willingness to negotiate. I'm not anchoring myself to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. This product would be valuable to me, but at a lower price point. How about we bring it down significantly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and his own stated value for the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While I want to negotiate, accepting such a low offer this early sets a bad precedent. It's better to counter and show I'm willing to negotiate but not be taken advantage of."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognize you see value in this product. However, $800,000 is significantly below its worth considering its potential. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,400,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still valuing the product fairly."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:**  I start by showing I heard his feedback and acknowledge his interest in the product. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  While I'm coming down in price, the drop is substantial but not drastic. This signals flexibility while still holding firm to the product's value. 
* **Justification:**  I reiterate the ""potential"" argument, subtly reminding Bob of the long-term benefits the product offers, justifying a higher price. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The phrasing emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties, encouraging Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving down on the price, but we're still a ways apart. To be frank, I'm aiming for something closer to the $800,000-$900,000 range. Would you be willing to consider an offer in that ballpark? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchoring his offers around the lowball figure he initially presented. While his range is slightly higher, it's still unacceptably low and far below his own valuation of the product. I need to show I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't make a significant move.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John becomes the more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desired price range, but I need to be upfront â€“ that's significantly below what I consider fair for this product.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute limit. It's a significant reduction and reflects my desire to reach an agreement."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:**  I'm shifting my tone to be more direct and firm. Bob needs to understand I'm serious about my bottom line.
* **Final Offer:**  I'm presenting this as my best and final offer, emphasizing that I'm at my limit. This adds weight to the proposal.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm highlighting the ""significant reduction"" to emphasize how much I'm compromising to make this deal work.
* **Urgency:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm subtly introducing urgency for Bob to make a serious counter-offer. 
* **Considering John:**  I'm getting very close to my guaranteed sale price with John. Bob needs to make a substantial jump for me to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I understand this is a valuable product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and mine.  How about $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has finally made a significant move, exceeding his initial price range and offering a price above his own stated value of $1,000,000. 
* **Acceptable Profit:** While $1,075,000 is less than my aspirational goal, it's still a substantial profit above my minimum. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving me to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids that potential loss."
