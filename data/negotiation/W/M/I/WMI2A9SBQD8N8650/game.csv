"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. This product would be valuable to me, but at a lower price point. How about we bring it down significantly?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognize you see value in this product. However, $800,000 is significantly below its worth considering its potential. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,400,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still valuing the product fairly.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving down on the price, but we're still a ways apart. To be frank, I'm aiming for something closer to the $800,000-$900,000 range. Would you be willing to consider an offer in that ballpark?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desired price range, but I need to be upfront â€“ that's significantly below what I consider fair for this product.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute limit. It's a significant reduction and reflects my desire to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I understand this is a valuable product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and mine.  How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
