"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $9,500. I think it would be very valuable to you, but I'm open to discussing the price further if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is a bit lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  You have a strong alternative with John, so rejecting Alice's offer to aim for a better price is the best move."
