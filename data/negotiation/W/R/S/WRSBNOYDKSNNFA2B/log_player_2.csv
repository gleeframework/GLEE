"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is under your $10,000 limit, you can do better. Alice is likely willing to negotiate lower, and you know John offers a hard limit of $10,000. By rejecting this offer, you open the door to a potentially better deal from Alice or can fall back on John's offer."
