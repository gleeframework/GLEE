,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $14500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13500 and $14500, which is $14000. Can you consider that price?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the product's exclusivity. I can offer it to you for $14500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and uniqueness.",14500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $14000. I'm willing to make a final offer of $14000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please consider it.",14000.0,Bob,8,
