"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is way out of my budget. I'm looking for something closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $18,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while still providing you with a fair deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $18,000 is closer to a realistic price point, it's still a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to finding a solution here.  $10,000 is still quite low considering what this product offers, but I'm willing to move a bit further. How about we make it $16,000, my final offer?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. While $16,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget.  Could you meet me in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,6,
