"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, considering the product is worth $15,000 to him.  Accepting this offer means Bob saves $4,000 compared to buying from John.  While he could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a much higher price."
