Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message aims to gauge Bob's interest while also conveying that the product is in demand (you have another buyer lined up). 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable counter-offering.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net at $10,000, securing a deal with Bob at a higher price is the primary objective."
