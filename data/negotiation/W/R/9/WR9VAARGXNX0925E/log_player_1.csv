{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this item which I believe would be valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value and significantly above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** While the price is higher than Bob's valuation, framing it as a potentially good deal for him might make him consider it. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no pressure to go below that. This strategy aims to get you the best possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
