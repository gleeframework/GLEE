"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to consider that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $110 is a bit low for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to meet me at $115? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is more reasonable for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that.  However, $115 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $120?  That's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
