"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
