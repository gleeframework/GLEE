"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate further.  Let's split the difference. I'd be willing to accept $1,400,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about we settle on $1,350,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
