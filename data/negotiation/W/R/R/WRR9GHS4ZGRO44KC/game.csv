"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is a significant step away from where I see this product's value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while giving you a more accessible price point.
