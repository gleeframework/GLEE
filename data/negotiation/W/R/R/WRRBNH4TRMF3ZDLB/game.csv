"Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I like it, $180 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $115? That's a fair price that works for me.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $130? It's a fair price that's closer to my minimum, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer. I can do $120, but that's really the most I can offer.  It's a fair deal considering I have other options available.",120.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $120 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $135? It's a fair price that's close to your offer, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,7,
