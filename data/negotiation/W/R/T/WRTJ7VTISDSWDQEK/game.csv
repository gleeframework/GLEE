"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value this product offers.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $12,000? This offer reflects the value of the product while hopefully still working within your budget.",12000.0,Alice,5,
