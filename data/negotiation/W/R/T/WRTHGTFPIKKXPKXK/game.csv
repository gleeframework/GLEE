"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me halfway. Would you consider $1,250,000 for this product?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
