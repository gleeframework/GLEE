"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $25000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to consider that?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $18000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $22000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $22000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer $20000. Would you be willing to consider that?",20000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $20000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $22500. This is my final concession, so I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",22500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I can offer $21250. Would you be willing to consider that?",21250.0,Bob,6,

"I've made significant concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's value. However, I still need to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'll meet you at $22000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",22000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I've already made multiple concessions, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll meet you at $21500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",21500.0,Alice,9,
