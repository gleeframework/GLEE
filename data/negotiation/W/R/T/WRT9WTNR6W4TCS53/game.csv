"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to you.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price we can both agree on. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This price would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,4,
