,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000?  This would still be a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1050000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
