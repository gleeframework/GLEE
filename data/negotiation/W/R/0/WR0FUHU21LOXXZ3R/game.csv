"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the significant return on investment you can expect.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $1,200,000. This reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above the mark. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. This is the highest I can go without compromising my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've reviewed my figures carefully, and to close this deal quickly, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,175,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,175,000, which would be $1,162,500. This is the best I can do.",1162500.0,Bob,6,
