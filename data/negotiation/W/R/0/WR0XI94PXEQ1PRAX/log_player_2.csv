"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price.  He has a fallback option with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a substantial discount.  He's aiming for a price that's still attractive to Alice but significantly lower than her initial offer.  This aggressive approach might lead to a quick deal if Alice is willing to compromise or set the stage for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a good price. While Bob could try for a lower price, there's a risk of Alice becoming stubborn or walking away from the deal entirely.  Accepting the offer ensures a purchase at a good price while still saving $400,000 compared to buying from John."
