I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiations and allows me to gauge his interest. I want to see if he's willing to play the negotiation game and how far he's willing to go."

We're running out of rounds and Bob's offer is below my minimum. It's time to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but it's clear he's not willing to meet my minimum value. It's better to secure the deal with John than risk getting nothing from Bob."
