"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $12,000, and Alice's offer is exactly at that limit, there's no room for negotiation to potentially save money. Buying from John for the same price guarantees you the product without any risk of a prolonged negotiation."
