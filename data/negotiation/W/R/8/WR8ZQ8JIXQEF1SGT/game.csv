"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about $10,200? This is a great deal for a product that's worth so much to you.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm really trying to stick to my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500 again? It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,6,
