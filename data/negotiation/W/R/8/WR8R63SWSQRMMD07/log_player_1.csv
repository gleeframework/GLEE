"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a strong opening position, allowing room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a significant profit.  I'll be closely watching Bob's response to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still being above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for me, and I'd rather secure the sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on this price."
