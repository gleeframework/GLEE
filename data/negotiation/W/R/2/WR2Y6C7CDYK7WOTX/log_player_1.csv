"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 150} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm open to hearing Bob's perspective. This is important to avoid immediately shutting down the negotiation. 
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language to emphasize the product's value and build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $120.
* **Negotiation:** I'm using this rejection to start a negotiation.
* **Room to maneuver:**  I need to explore if I can get a higher price from Bob than $120.
* **Next round:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping for a bit more to make this worthwhile. Would you be willing to consider $135?  I think this price still offers a good value for you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value for Bob with the phrase ""good value for you"".
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm still leaving room for further negotiation to potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a bit more, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $125? I think that's a fair price for the product 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum of $120.
* **Time Constraint:** We're already in Round 4, and the time is ticking.
* **Risk of John:**  If I reject this offer and keep negotiating, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be stuck selling to John for my minimum.
* **Potential for Higher:**  While it's not ideal, accepting this offer allows me to quickly close the deal and potentially use the extra $5 to negotiate with John for a higher price later."
