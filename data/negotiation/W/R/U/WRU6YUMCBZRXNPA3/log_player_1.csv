"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer slightly, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also starting to get concerned that Bob might not be willing to meet my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,800 is simply too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop to $8,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $7,900 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer slightly again, we are approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds.  His offers are still below my minimum acceptable price, and it is unlikely he will come up to my price point. It's better to sell to John for $10,000 than to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get a worse deal."
