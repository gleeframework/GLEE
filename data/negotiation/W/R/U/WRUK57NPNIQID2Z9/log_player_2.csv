"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to go that high.  I will try to negotiate a lower price."
