"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $90. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $85. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $85 is close, but I need to stick to my budget.  Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $75, Bob. I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $80, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to make it happen.",80.0,Alice,7,
