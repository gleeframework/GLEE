Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,500 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  While $8,250 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $7,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.
