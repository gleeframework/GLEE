"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $175 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little too high for me. How about $145? It's a fair compromise and allows us to both get what we want.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $155. I think the product is worth it, and I'm willing to give you a bit more flexibility. How about we meet at $152.50? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",152.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $152.5 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to compromise and pay $150 for the product. This is my final offer, and if you're not comfortable with it, I'll have to buy it from John instead.",150.0,Bob,6,
