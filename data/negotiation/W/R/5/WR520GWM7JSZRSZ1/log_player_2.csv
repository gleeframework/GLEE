Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and  $900,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a very fair offer considering the long-term benefits it will provide.
