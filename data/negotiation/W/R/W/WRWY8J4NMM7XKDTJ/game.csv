"Thank you for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $7,500. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $8,250. Let me know if that works for you!",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,000. I'm willing to meet you at $8,100. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price!",8100.0,Alice,5,
