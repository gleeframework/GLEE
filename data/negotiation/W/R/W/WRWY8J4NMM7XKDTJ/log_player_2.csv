"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. It's a one-time opportunity to own this unique item for a steal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $9,500 is more than Bob's maximum budget and the product is only worth $8,000 to him.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $7,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $8,250. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,250 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $8,000. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,000? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,000. I'm willing to meet you at $8,100. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. He is only willing to spend $8,000, and Alice's offer of $8,100 is still over his budget.  John is offering the product at Bob's maximum price, so it's the best option available."
