"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? It's a significant saving for me, but still allows you a decent profit.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,250,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000? It feels like a fair compromise where we both gain.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This is the absolute lowest I can go while still getting a reasonable return on my product.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
