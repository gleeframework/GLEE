It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price. You know you can get it for $800,000 from John, so you have room to bargain."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice has come down from her initial price, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John, so you have leverage to continue negotiating."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $900,000 is a good offer, but I need to be at $925,000 to make this deal work for me. It's a small difference, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's worth accepting Alice's offer.  You're getting a good deal at $925,000, which is only $25,000 more than what you could get from John.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal with Alice and then having to buy from John at a higher price."
