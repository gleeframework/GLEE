{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Benefit for Both:** My message emphasizes a win-win scenario, hoping to make Bob more receptive.
* **Room for Counteroffers:** This offer leaves space for Bob to counteroffer without making me feel like I'm immediately giving away too much.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I know I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not overly pressured to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $850,000 is less than my absolute minimum of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While it's a lower price, it's not completely unreasonable. There's room to negotiate, which makes rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer the most strategic option. 
* **John's Offer:** I have John's offer as a fallback, so I'm not in a rush to settle for a price that's not close to my goal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.  
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:**  My message again focuses on finding a solution that benefits both parties, hoping to build trust and encourage acceptance. 
* **Maintain a Margin:**  $950,000 is still above my minimum of $1,200,000, but it's significantly closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Keep the Negotiation Moving:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility while maintaining my stance on a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $900,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000.  
* **John's Offer Remains:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so there's no urgency to settle for a price lower than my minimum. 
* **Further Negotiation:**  $900,000 is closer to my target price, making further negotiation a worthwhile option. There's still room to potentially reach a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $900,000 is a good offer, but I need to be at $925,000 to make this deal work for me. It's a small difference, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Counteroffer:** I'm only increasing the price by $25,000, showing a genuine willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Shared Benefit:** My message stresses that this small difference will result in a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Close to Bob's Offer:**  $925,000 is very close to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Maintaining My Value:**  While I'm coming down, I'm still holding firm on a price that meets my minimum requirements."
