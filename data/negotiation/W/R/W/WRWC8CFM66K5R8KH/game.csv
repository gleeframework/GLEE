"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $900,000 is a good offer, but I need to be at $925,000 to make this deal work for me. It's a small difference, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this happen.",925000.0,Alice,5,
