Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Room for compromise:**  The $13,000 offer allows for a middle ground where both of us can feel like we've gotten a good deal.
* **Positive language:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of selling to Bob while still securing a price that is above my minimum. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too low:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would leave me with a significant loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I believe there's still room for a higher offer. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John would guarantee my minimum, I'm still hopeful to negotiate a better price with Bob.  The risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob is worth the potential for a higher payout."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair price:**  $12,000 still represents a good deal for Bob, as it's below his perceived value of $10,000.  
* **Positive language:** The message remains friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation going.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us. I'm hoping that by offering a more reasonable price, Bob will be more inclined to accept and I'll secure a better deal than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Near the limit:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below it.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob and ending up with a lower price than I'd like is too high. 
* **Guaranteed outcome:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation that could lead to a less desirable outcome.

In this situation, the certainty of selling to John outweighs the potential of a slightly better deal with Bob, especially considering we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation."
