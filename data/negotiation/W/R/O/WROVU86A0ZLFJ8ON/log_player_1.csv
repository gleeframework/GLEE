"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value, but still potentially attractive to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to stick with my minimum value for now. If Bob still isn't willing to meet me at $12,000, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still holding out for a good amount. If Bob rejects this, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal. If Bob rejects this, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to get a price closer to my desired value. Bob's offer of $9,800 is still below my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get him to go higher in these last rounds.  Selling to John for $12,000 ensures I get my minimum value and don't risk losing out completely."
