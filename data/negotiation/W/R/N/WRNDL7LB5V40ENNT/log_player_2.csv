"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a decent price, it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000, but it's still above her minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking for a good deal.  It's a starting point for negotiation that is likely to lead to a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there is still potential to get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer allows for more negotiation and potentially a lower final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise.  This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and closer to Alice's likely acceptable price, making it a good compromise point for both parties."
