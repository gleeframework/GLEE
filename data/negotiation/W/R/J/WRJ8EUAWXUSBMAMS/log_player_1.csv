Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds based on his reaction."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,000 is too low for me, considering the product is worth at least $10,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if I can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise. I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm coming down again, but this time by a smaller amount. I want to see if Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, and if he's not, I might consider selling to John in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm hoping to squeeze out a bit more.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round. If Bob rejects that offer, I'll likely consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm only willing to go down to $10,500.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John in the next round."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better to secure the $10,000 from John than to risk a further drop in price with Bob."
