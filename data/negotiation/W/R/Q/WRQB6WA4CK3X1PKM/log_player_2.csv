"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is far above his budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer, potentially lowering the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with the maximum price he's willing to pay, hoping to secure the product at the lowest possible price. He's immediately offering John's price, hoping Alice will accept and avoid further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000, securing the product at his maximum budget.  Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the product entirely."
