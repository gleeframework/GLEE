Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to both of us, I propose a price of $1,000,000 for it. This is a special introductory offer considering the high demand for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I would like to make a counterproposal. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I am willing to consider $950,000 as the price for it. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant improvement from her initial $1,000,000 offer and puts me closer to my desired price point.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a decent price and avoids the risk of a lengthy negotiation that may not result in a better deal."
