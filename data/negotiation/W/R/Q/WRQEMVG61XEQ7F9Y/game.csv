"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll find fascinating. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest. While the product sounds intriguing, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $900000 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $850000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to give up much more. I'm now offering the product to you for $875000. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
