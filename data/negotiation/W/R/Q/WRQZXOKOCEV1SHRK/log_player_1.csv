"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a high price, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm being positive and highlighting the benefit for Bob, hoping to encourage a quick deal. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible while still leaving room for negotiation. I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and the number of rounds remaining. If Bob isn't willing to negotiate, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value and even lower than what the product is worth to him. Accepting this offer would result in a huge loss. 

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will continue to negotiate with him. I believe there is still room for a deal that's beneficial for both of us, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still well above my minimum value. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving in to his lowball offer.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing fairness. I'm also suggesting a ""meet in the middle"" approach to encourage Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's initial offer, I'm aiming to show flexibility and encourage him to come up on his price. I'm still confident I can get a higher price than his initial offer, but I need to be strategic to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product is valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I could go up to $700,000.  That's a significant increase from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is an improvement, it's still significantly below my minimum value and even below what the product is worth to him.  Accepting this offer would mean a substantial financial loss.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to continue negotiating with Bob. Although time is running out, I'm confident that with strategic counteroffers, I can secure a deal closer to my desired price.  It's crucial to stay firm and not settle for an offer that is significantly lower than the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still not enough.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's last offer, but still significantly above his initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but am not giving in to his lowball offers. 
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, emphasizing fairness, and expressing a desire to work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Strategy:**

With only 5 rounds left, I need to close the deal quickly while still securing a price as close to my minimum as possible. By offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, I'm hoping to make him feel like he's getting a good deal while still achieving a decent profit.  If this offer fails, I'll need to evaluate the remaining time and Bob's negotiation behavior to determine whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still lower than my target price.  With only 4 rounds left, I need to keep negotiating to secure a better deal.  

**Strategy:**

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to push the price closer to my desired amount. If Bob is unwilling to budge further, I'll have to weigh the risk of continuing to negotiate against the certainty of selling to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference: $762,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm ready to close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 762500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that's in the middle of our last two offers, showing my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable profit.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing fairness, highlighting the value of the product, and expressing my readiness to finalize the deal.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds left, I'm pushing for a quick deal. By offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, I hope to incentivize him to accept. However, if he rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round, as the risk of not reaching a deal increases with each passing round."
