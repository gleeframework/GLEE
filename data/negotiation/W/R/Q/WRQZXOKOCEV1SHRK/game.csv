"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still not enough.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's work together to make this happen.",775000.0,Alice,5,
