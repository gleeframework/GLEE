Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. If you're not willing to go that low, I'm going to have to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for a higher price, Bob's mention of John suggests he might be serious about walking away. Accepting the $85 offer is better than risking a deal with John for only $80."
