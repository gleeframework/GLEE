"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is unfortunately a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value it brings to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. Considering your interest and the value it brings to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $900,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a better deal. Given my maximum budget, I'm offering $875,000. This reflects a significant commitment from my end and is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer the product to you for $887,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",887500.0,Alice,5,
