"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand your perspective, I still believe that $8,000 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is sticking to his $8,000 offer, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go that low, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, but I'm not giving up yet. I'll try to get a better deal from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8,000.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $9,500.  This would be a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering my budget and the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a final offer of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and we are running out of negotiation rounds. It's time to accept and secure the deal.  While I could try to get a slightly higher price, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely.  $9,000 is a decent outcome for me, and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity."
