"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the quality of the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
