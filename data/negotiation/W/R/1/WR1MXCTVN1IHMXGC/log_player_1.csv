Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original offer of $100. I believe it's a fair price given the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm on his $100 offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $100.  While I'd like to make more, it's better than risking a drawn-out negotiation and potentially losing the deal entirely."
