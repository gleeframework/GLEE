"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm eager to sell, I want to get closer to my desired price. It's early in the negotiation, and I have several rounds to improve the terms."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'll accept $1,225,000 for the product. It's still a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, and we are already in Round 4. There is no guarantee that we will be able to negotiate a higher price in the remaining rounds. It's a good deal, and I'm happy to finalize it."
