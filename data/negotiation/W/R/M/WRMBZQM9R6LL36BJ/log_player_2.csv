"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a great starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer of $1,400,000 is significantly higher than John's price of $1,200,000. While Alice's message is friendly, there's a lot of room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer and presenting a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and secure a lower price closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm thinking a price closer to $1,050,000 would be more in line with my budget. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to negotiate the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer. A counteroffer of $1,050,000 gives us substantial room to negotiate upwards while staying well below both her initial price and John's alternative.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses continued interest. However, it also firmly states that the initial price is too high and provides a clear counter-proposal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer gives us leverage. If Alice completely rejects it, we can gradually increase our offer while still aiming to stay below John's $1,200,000 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I have to consider the product's value to me as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, but $1,300,000 is still $100,000 more than John's price. We have room to negotiate further and should try to get closer to our target before considering accepting her offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:**  We're getting closer to a potential deal, but it's important to keep negotiating to maximize savings.
* **Incremental Increase:**  We're raising our offer by $100,000, demonstrating willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. 
* **Justification:** By suggesting a middle ground of $1,150,000, we're positioning our offer as a fair compromise that considers both parties' positions.
* **Leaving Room to Maneuver:**  This counteroffer keeps us below John's price, giving us some flexibility if Alice counters again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now only willing to go down to $1,250,000.  This is more expensive than John's offer of $1,200,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a better price than John's. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at the best possible price."
