"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm thinking a price closer to $1,050,000 would be more in line with my budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I have to consider the product's value to me as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
