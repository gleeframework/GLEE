"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $950,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value to you while also allowing me to earn a fair profit.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
