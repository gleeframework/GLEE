"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, and while John's price is higher, it's a fallback option if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $950,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value to you while also allowing me to earn a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Even though it's a discount from her initial offer, it's still above my target.  I'm going to try and counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value to you while also allowing me to earn a decent profit. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still higher than my ideal price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get her down to a price closer to $900,000.  If she doesn't budge, I might have to consider buying from John, but I want to exhaust all options with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I think we're very close to a deal.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000 for the product.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe this offer is fair considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 910000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is a slight increase from your previous offer. I believe this price is a fair compromise and allows us to finalize the deal. Let's see if we can wrap up the transaction at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $10,000 higher than my last counteroffer.  While it would be nice to get it down to $910,000, there's a chance she won't budge.  At this point, I'm closer to my target price and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price.  I'm going to accept this offer and finalize the transaction."
