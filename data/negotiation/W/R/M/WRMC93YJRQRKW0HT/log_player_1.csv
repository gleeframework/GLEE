Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. It invites him to engage in the negotiation.
* **Back-up Plan:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I'm aware of John's offer and can walk away if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low offer right away. It's important to establish a stronger starting point. 
* **Counter-Offer:** I will make a counter-offer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal my willingness to continue the negotiation while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $1,050,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant jump from Bob's initial offer but still below my ideal price. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** Aiming for a price in the middle of our initial offers (between $900,000 and $1,250,000) shows a desire for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Value Proposition:** The message again emphasizes the value Bob will gain from the product, encouraging him to see the worth of the offer.
* **Clear Price:**  I'm stating a clear counter-offer price, leaving no room for ambiguity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Enough:** While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:**  I'm in a strong position because I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay my desired price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation.
* **Counter-Offer:** I'm confident I can secure a better deal by making a counter-offer. My goal is to bridge the gap further, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal my determination to negotiate for a price that's more favorable to me while leaving the door open for a successful deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 just isn't enough for me to move forward.  How about $1,000,000? That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product, and it allows me to reach a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're willing to go that far."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This offer is my final compromise, aiming for a price that is closer to Bob's value but still profitable for me.
* **Clear Signal:** The message emphasizes the finality of the offer while still maintaining a friendly tone. 
* **Value Justification:** I reiterate the value proposition for Bob, making it clear that the price is justified by the benefits he'll receive. 

By sticking to my position and offering a clear price, I'm hoping to persuade Bob to accept my counteroffer and finalize the deal. If he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John for my desired price."
