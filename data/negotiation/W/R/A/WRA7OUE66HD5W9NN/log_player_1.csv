Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $25,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 25000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, aiming to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a good profit.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal and expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob. This could encourage him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, signaling my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $18000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer, it's still below my floor of $15,000.
* **Negotiation room:** Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation and try to get a better price.
* **Ten rounds:** I have enough rounds to continue negotiating without risking losing out to John.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $21,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 21500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing my willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and suggesting the compromise is fair, making the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $21,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $21500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $20000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While $20,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I have several rounds left, and I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Risk assessment:** Selling to John for $15,000 would guarantee a sale but would result in a lower profit. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially securing a better deal with Bob.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $20,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about $20,750?  It's a small step closer to your offer, and I'm confident you'll find the value of this product well worth it."", ""product_price"": 20750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession by moving closer to Bob's offer, showing my flexibility.
* **High enough:** $20,750 is still above my minimum acceptable price and allows for a decent profit.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value again and suggesting that the price is fair, increasing the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  I'm trying to bridge the gap between our offers without giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $20750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $19500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $19,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $19,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:**  $19,500 is still higher than my minimum of $15,000, which is good.
* **Room for negotiation:** With 4 rounds remaining, I have time to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of selling to John:** While selling to John would guarantee a sale, it would result in a lower profit. I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. I aim to find a price that is closer to my desired value and potentially reach an agreement before the remaining rounds run out."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm again proposing a middle ground between our current offers, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.

* **Limited rounds:** With only 3 rounds left, it's important to try to reach an agreement to avoid losing out to John."
