"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000.  This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still well within your budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it would be a great starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll reduce my price to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair offer that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $1,275,000? That's a smaller step than before, and we're getting closer to a deal.  Let's find that common ground. ",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offers, so I'll propose $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
