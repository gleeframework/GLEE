Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000.  This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still well within your budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll reduce my price to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair offer that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $1,275,000? That's a smaller step than before, and we're getting closer to a deal.  Let's find that common ground.
