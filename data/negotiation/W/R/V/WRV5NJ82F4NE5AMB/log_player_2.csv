"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way too high, and Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He's offering $600,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum value of $800,000. This is a bold move, and it's likely to make Alice think about lowering her expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a better offer than the initial $900,000, Bob still has room to negotiate further. He can likely get a better price by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer.  Remember, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's still a gap between Alice's offer and what he's willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise. $700,000 is still a significant discount from Alice's last offer and is closer to the middle ground between their positions. This move could encourage Alice to accept the offer or come back with a counteroffer closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob has already rejected several offers, and while he wants a lower price, Alice is showing some flexibility.  Accepting the offer at $820,000 allows Bob to acquire the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer, while still leaving some room for profit.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that the negotiations will drag on.  It's a calculated decision to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
