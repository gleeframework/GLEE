"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. This reflects the true worth and potential I see in its application for your specific needs."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  While I know Bob values the product at $800,000 and my minimum is $1,200,000, I start with a strong offer of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation but establishes a firm upper anchor.
* **Justification:**  I provide a reason for the high price, focusing on the product's value and potential benefits *specifically for Bob*. This framing aims to shift his focus away from just his valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting point gives me room to negotiate down if needed, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profitable outcome.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm aware I have the option to walk away and sell to John at any time. This knowledge gives me leverage and confidence in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your perspective on its value. After careful consideration, I would like to propose an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to his valuation but still falls short of my $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a significant gap between his offer and my starting price, suggesting there's room for negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:**  I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiation doesn't move closer to my target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the product's value.  To be frank, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident that this product can generate significant returns for your business, which is why I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between its potential and the current market conditions."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $150,000, which is a significant move designed to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  Crucially, I'm still well above my $1,200,000 minimum, leaving room for further adjustments.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's potential value specifically for Bob's business, subtly anchoring the discussion around its benefits rather than just the price.
* **Observation:** I'm paying close attention to Bob's counter-offers to gauge his potential upper limit and adjust my strategy accordingly in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've given this careful thought, and I would like to counter with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 matches my absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strong Position:**  While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob would agree. Accepting now secures the deal at my desired minimum. 
* **Time Consideration:**  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk that Bob might not go any higher or that the deal could fall through. Accepting now eliminates that risk."
