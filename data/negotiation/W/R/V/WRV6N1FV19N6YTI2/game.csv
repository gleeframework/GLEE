"I'm very interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need to be closer to $16,000 to make this work.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000, so I'll offer $14,000. Would you be willing to accept that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
