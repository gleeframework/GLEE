{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $17,000, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($17,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also stating my willingness to listen to his thoughts, which shows I'm open to discussion and not just trying to push a price.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is far too low for me. While I am open to negotiation, I am not willing to accept a price that is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need to be closer to $16,000 to make this work.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm sticking to my minimum goal of $15,000 by offering $16,000. I'm hoping this compromise will entice Bob to continue negotiating.  I'm also using a friendly tone to keep the conversation positive. Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000, so I'll offer $14,000. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough for me.  I'm not willing to risk losing a sale to John for such a small gain. I've already given Bob a significant discount, and it seems we've reached a stalemate.  

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is a fair deal for both of us."
