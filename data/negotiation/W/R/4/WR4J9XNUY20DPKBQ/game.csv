"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering what I've seen so far.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit far from that price point. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This would give you a good deal, and still leave me with a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the worth of the product to you and my own budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
