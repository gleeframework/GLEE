"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's actually more than the product is worth to you! It's time to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $14,000? It's a compromise that still benefits me, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Alice is coming down in price, $14,000 is still above your maximum budget and what you could get it for from John.  It's worth negotiating further."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying, but I need you to meet me closer to my budget."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to increase your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product. However, $10,000 is still below my minimum price. Considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12,500? It's a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to work with you, but also reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,500, and you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John to secure the best deal."
