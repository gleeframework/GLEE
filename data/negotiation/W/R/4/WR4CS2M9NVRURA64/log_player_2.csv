"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it for $150.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $150 for the product, there is no reason to negotiate with Alice.  John is offering the same price, so buying from him saves you the time and effort of negotiation."
