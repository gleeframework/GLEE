Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially gain more.
* **Justification:** While I don't want to reveal all my cards, I hint at the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm directly asking for Bob's ""thoughts,"" signaling I'm open to hearing his perspective and potentially negotiating.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still having a good chance of securing a deal with Bob."
