"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me. However, $110 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $95?  That's closer to what I can afford and would be a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget. $105 is still a bit too high. Let's meet in the middle at $100. That would be a good compromise, and I'd be happy to buy the product.",100.0,Bob,6,
