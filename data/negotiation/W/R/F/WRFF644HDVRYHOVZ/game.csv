"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant discount for you.  Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would that work for you?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $700,000 is still not within my range.  To make this work, I need to be closer to $900,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
