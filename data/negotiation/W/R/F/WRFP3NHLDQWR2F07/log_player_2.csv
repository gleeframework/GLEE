Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,150,000 to make this work for me. This is a fair price considering the product's true value, and it gives us both a good deal.
