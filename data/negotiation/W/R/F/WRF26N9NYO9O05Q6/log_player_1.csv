Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning you believe the product is worth ""a great deal"", you're subtly suggesting the price is justified. 
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you're creating a subtle sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker.

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down.  The worst-case scenario is you sell it to John for your minimum price."
