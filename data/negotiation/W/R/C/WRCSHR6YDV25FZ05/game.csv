"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you coming down from your original price, but I'm still looking to get a slightly better deal.  Would you be willing to go down to $1,000,000?  It's a great product, but I'm hoping to keep the cost closer to my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
