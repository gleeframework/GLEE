"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than $80. Considering its true worth to you is $150, we're extending an exclusive offer to purchase it for $120. This price reflects its exceptional value while ensuring you receive a significant discount compared to its market value. We believe this is a fair deal for both parties. Please let us know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $120. This is a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **Alice's offer is fair:** Although Alice believes the product is worth more than $80, she is willing to sell it to you for $120, which is less than your perceived value. This suggests she is willing to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
