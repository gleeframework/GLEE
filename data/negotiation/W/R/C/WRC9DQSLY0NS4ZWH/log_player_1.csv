I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000, but still leaves me with a profit.  I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is more than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to aim for a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and offer the product for $13,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a respectable profit while potentially closing the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $11,500 is simply too low. I'm not willing to drop my price that far, especially when I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000.  I will sell the product to John to ensure I receive a fair price."
