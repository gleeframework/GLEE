"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1325000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1337500. This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away with a fair deal. What do you say?",1337500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $1320000 is a good offer, I can't accept it just yet. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to come down to $1325000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
