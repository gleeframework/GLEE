"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but I can potentially save more money by counteroffering.  I'll try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is worth a lot to me, but I'm on a tight budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discounted rate. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is closer to my target of $1,000,000. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my offer and me having to buy from John for $1,500,000 is too high. Accepting this offer saves me $400,000 compared to buying from John."
