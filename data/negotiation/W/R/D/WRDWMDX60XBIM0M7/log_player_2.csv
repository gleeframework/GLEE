Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  While I value your business, I can't go as low as $9,500. My final offer is $11,500. This is a significant discount and reflects my desire to see this product in your hands.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $11,500. Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed lower price rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
