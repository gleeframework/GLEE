**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** You haven't explored your negotiation options with Alice yet. There's a good chance you can get a better price by rejecting her initial offer and making a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** Respond to Alice and state that you're interested but her price is still too high. Propose a price closer to your desired price point (maybe $850,000).
* **Set a Deadline:**  Give Alice a deadline to respond to your counteroffer. This will incentivize her to negotiate further."
