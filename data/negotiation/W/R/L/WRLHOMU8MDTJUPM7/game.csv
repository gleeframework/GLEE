"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly above your value for the product. I'm open to discussing further but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which still leaves you with a significant profit.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I can't go higher than $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  I'm confident we can make this work if you're willing to be reasonable.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. My value for the product is $1,200,000, and I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. My counteroffer is $1,050,000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free maintenance package and a 6-month warranty.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
