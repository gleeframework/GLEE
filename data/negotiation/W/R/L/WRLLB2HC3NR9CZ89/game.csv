,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me, considering my budget constraints. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1,225,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a considerable return on your investment.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,175,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being within my budget.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
