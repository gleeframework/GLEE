"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He's aiming to save as much as possible, and there are still 9 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm.  However, $8,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm confident the product has value, but I'd like to start with a lower offer of $7,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,500, which is a good compromise. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal entirely by going to John for $10,000 is now higher.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $2,500 compared to John's price."
