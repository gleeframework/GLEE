Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm.  However, $8,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm confident the product has value, but I'd like to start with a lower offer of $7,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}"
