Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it's of great value and would be beneficial to you."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible without losing him to a rejection.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $90 is a strong starting point, it leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have John as a backup buyer at $80, so we don't want to offer the product to Bob below that price."
