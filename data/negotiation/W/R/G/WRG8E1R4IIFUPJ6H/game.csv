"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else.",200.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $150 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the original price I had in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get an amazing deal.",175.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $155 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",155.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $165. It's getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",165.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle.

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not convinced it's the best deal for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",140.0,Bob,8,
