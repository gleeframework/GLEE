Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm proposing a price of $16,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""anticipated demand,"" you create a sense of desirability and scarcity, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you start at $16,000, the tone suggests you might be open to discussion. This keeps Bob engaged rather than immediately rejecting the offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so you're not desperate. This allows you to be firm in your negotiation with Bob."
