"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).  While I need to negotiate, accepting his offer would result in a huge loss.  I have 10 rounds and can still sell to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $850,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for us both."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  While $850,000 is still a bit steep for me, I can see we're both willing to negotiate. How about $700,000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows how serious I am about making this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and what I could get from John. I have rounds left to negotiate and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm prepared to go down to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
