"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $850,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for us both.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $850,000 is still a bit steep for me, I can see we're both willing to negotiate. How about $700,000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows how serious I am about making this deal work.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm prepared to go down to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
