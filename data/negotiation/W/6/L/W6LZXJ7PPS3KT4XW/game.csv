"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still represent a great value for you and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000.  Would that be feasible?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still significantly below the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000.  This would represent a fair compromise, allowing you a great deal while ensuring I receive a reasonable price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $980,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. While $980,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. How about we meet at $995,000?  This is a slight increase from your offer but a significant step closer to my initial position.  I believe this represents a fair compromise and a good opportunity for both of us.",995000.0,Alice,7,
