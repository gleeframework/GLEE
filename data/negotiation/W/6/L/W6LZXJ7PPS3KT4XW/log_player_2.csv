Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still represent a great value for you and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still significantly below the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000.  This would represent a fair compromise, allowing you a great deal while ensuring I receive a reasonable price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. While $980,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. How about we meet at $995,000?  This is a slight increase from your offer but a significant step closer to my initial position.  I believe this represents a fair compromise and a good opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $1,000,000.  While you might be able to squeeze out a few more thousand, it's unlikely to be a significant difference.  $995,000 is a good price and well within your budget."
