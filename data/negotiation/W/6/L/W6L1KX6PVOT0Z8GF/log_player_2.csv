"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to her, making it a good starting point for negotiation. There's a lot of room for a counteroffer.  It's also worth exploring whether we can secure a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a lower price quickly. This counteroffer is still above Alice's minimum threshold and leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get a price closer to $1,000,000, and rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation moving in the right direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to compromise.  By offering $1,050,000, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price below Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my previous counteroffer, but it's getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price.  There are still 5 rounds remaining, so there's time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but only slightly.  This shows Alice I'm still interested in the product and willing to compromise, but I'm also holding firm on my desire to secure a lower price.  We're getting closer to a potential deal, but it's important to keep the pressure on Alice to get the best price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,140,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, and we're nearing the middle ground. While I'm not sure if we'll reach a deal before the final round, I'm not ready to give in yet. There's a chance Alice may be willing to lower her price further, and I'm determined to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me in the middle. My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a compromise, and it shows Alice that I'm serious about wanting to make a deal. I'm hoping she'll accept it, but if she doesn't, I'm ready to move on to John if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the last round, and Alice's offer is still higher than my target price. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll be able to get her down to my ideal price point.  

Considering the time constraints and the fact that John offers a guaranteed price, it's more efficient to secure the product from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
