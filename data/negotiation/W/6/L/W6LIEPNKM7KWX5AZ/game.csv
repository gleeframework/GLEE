Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.,1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this incredible product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're still looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go below $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1275000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your final offer. I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1240000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1240000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate after my final offer. I'm not willing to go below $1250000, and I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $1240000. I think we've reached a stalemate. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1200000.",0.0,Alice,7,
