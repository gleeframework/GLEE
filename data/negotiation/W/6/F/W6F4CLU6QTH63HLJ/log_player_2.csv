"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate a much better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message maintains a positive tone and expresses continued interest in the product.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts us in a good position. Even if Alice rejects it outright, we've set a low anchor point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to our desired price, $9,000 is still significantly higher than our alternative with John ($8,000). We have room to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair price and I'm ready to close the deal today if you're happy with it."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between her current offer ($9,000) and our previous offer ($6,000). This can be a persuasive negotiating tactic.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning ""closing the deal today,"" we subtly increase the pressure on Alice to make a decision.
* **Near Our Limit:**  We're getting close to John's price, so we're signaling that we're serious but also nearing the end of our negotiating flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I'm not quite ready to accept $7,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice has made it clear that $8,500 is her final offer.
* **Better Alternative:**  John offers the product for $8,000. While a deal with Alice might be possible at $8,000, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  John's price is guaranteed.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure the product at a better price from John."
