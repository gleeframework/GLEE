"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to consider paying $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's worth to you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
