Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to consider paying $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
