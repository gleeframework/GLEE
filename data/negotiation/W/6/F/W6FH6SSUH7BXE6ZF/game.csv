"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,200,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is a significant way off from what I have in mind.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. I think this reflects the true value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,250,000, which would be $1,125,000. Would you be open to considering this price?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
