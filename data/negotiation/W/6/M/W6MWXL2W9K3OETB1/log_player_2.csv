"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. While it's a good deal compared to her actual value, it's worth trying to negotiate further. You can try to get a lower price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is very tempting, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While this product represents a significant investment, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your ideal price, but it's now within your budget.  Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk Alice will reject and you might end up with no deal. At $1,100,000, you're still saving $100,000 compared to buying from John. It's a reasonable compromise."
