"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also leaves you a significant profit margin (as the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice).  It's a good deal, so accepting it is the best strategy."
