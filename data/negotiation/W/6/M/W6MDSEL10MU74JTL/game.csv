"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique opportunity,  $1500000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for 1300000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1300000. However, I'm still a bit over budget. Would you be willing to consider $1100000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 1100000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for 1200000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value it brings. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
