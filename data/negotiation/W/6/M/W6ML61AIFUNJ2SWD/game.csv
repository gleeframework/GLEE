"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential return on investment for you.  I could consider a price of $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
