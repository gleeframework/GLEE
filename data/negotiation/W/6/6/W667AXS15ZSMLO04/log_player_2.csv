"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a price of $120. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $150. Let me know if you're interested!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

At this point, Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit but is also showing a willingness to negotiate. While we might be able to push her down a little further, the potential savings are getting smaller and smaller. Accepting $118 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down, forcing us to buy from John at $150."
