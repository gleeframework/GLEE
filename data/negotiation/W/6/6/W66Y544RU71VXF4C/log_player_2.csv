"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
Let's negotiate! Alice's starting price is higher than both your maximum and her perceived value. There's room for you to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Polite and Positive:**  Maintains a good negotiating relationship with Alice.
* **Expresses Interest:** Shows you are serious about buying, encouraging Alice to continue negotiating.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The offer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but still leaves room for negotiation while staying above Alice's perceived value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see the value you place on the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still not in a range I'm happy with. It's worth another counteroffer to see if she'll move closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could you do $8,750? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 8750
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Acknowledges Progress:**  Recognizes Alice's movement and keeps a positive tone.
* **Clearly States Budget:**  Reiterates that the current price is outside your comfort zone.
* **Offers Compromise:**  Suggests a specific price that is a significant jump towards your goal, but still leaves room for Alice to negotiate slightly upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your target price, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I can see the value you're placing on the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! We've negotiated Alice down $1,000 from her initial offer. While we could try to push for even lower, there's a risk she'll walk away. Accepting at $9,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
