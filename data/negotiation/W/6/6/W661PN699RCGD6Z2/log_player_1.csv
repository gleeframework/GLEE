Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he doesn't, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I don't want to give away too much value too early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I believe this is a fair price that shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 less than what I would get from John. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm confident I can still make a profit.  It's important to secure the sale and not risk losing the deal to someone else."
