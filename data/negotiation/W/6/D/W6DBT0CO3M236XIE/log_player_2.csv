"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $95, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's closer to my limit, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, as it's still higher than what I'd pay John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still above my limit.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly higher price, but still within my budget. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, while also leaving a bit of room for her to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get it for $80, this is the best offer I've gotten from Alice, and it's only $9 over my limit. I'm risking running out of rounds before I can get a better price from her."
