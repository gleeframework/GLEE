"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $10,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $10,000. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me to let go of this product.  I'm feeling generous, though.  How about $9,500?  It's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with it. Let's close this deal!",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $9,000. I'm starting to consider buying from John, who is willing to sell it to me for $10,000. Can you really do any better than $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
