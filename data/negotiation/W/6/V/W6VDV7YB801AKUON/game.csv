"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a little bit more. How about $15,500 and we have a deal?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $15,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,500.  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",14500.0,Bob,6,
