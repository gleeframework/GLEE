"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a great compromise, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product at this price.",950000.0,Alice,3,

This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe you'll be happy with the quality and features you'll get at this price.",900000.0,Alice,5,
