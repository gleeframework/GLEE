"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I see in the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering both our interests. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'd be willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your firm stance.  However, $1,075,000 simply isn't enough for me to part with this product. Let's make a final compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,090,000. This is a small step from my last offer, and a big step for me. I believe this is a fair price that allows us to both walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,090,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
