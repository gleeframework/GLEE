"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident we can come to a deal at this point.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $13,000. Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free upgrade and a warranty, which adds significant value to the product. I'm still firm on the price, but I'm open to negotiating further. My final offer is $14,000, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
