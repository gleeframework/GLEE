``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation, but still significantly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This way, I can maximize my profit while still having a chance to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counterpropose a price of $10,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and our shared goal of finding a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but closer than his initial perceived value. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. This will test his willingness to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position and respect the value you place on the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,750. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I've already made several concessions. While I could continue to negotiate, the potential for a better outcome is diminishing. To ensure I secure my minimum profit, I'll choose to sell to John for $12,000."
