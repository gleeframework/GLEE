{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price slightly or consider his counteroffer. However, if he accepts, I've made a good profit.  It's important to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but $9,500 is too low. I will make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I've lowered my price, but I'm still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while staying within my minimum acceptable price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price of $12,000, it's better to secure a sale now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing."
