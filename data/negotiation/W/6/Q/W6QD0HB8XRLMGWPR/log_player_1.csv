Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it's a great deal at $115. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you earn more than your minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning listing the product publicly implies scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer."
