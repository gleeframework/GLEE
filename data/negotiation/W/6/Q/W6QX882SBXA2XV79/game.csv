"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. $12000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go to $9500.  This is my final offer, I'm not able to go any higher.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $11000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
