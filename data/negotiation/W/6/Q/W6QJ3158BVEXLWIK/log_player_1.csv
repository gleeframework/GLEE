"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $180. This is a bold move, but I believe it's a good starting point given my minimum value of $150 and the fact that I can always fall back on selling to John for that price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate towards a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's well below my minimum value of $150, and I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round to see if we can find a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130. This is a significant concession, but I'm still above my minimum value of $150.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging Bob's lower valuation.  I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will encourage Bob to negotiate further and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough to make it worthwhile for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round. I have some room to negotiate, but I'm also aware of the time limit, so I'll need to be strategic with my next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm dropping my price to $120. This is a further concession, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my initial asking price.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's previous offers.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will finally be acceptable to Bob and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $150. I'm not willing to accept a loss on this product. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm dropping my price to $115.  We're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a small profit.  This is my final counteroffer, and if Bob rejects it, I'll sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time and it seems like Bob isn't willing to budge any further.  I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum value and ensures I don't end up with a bad deal."
