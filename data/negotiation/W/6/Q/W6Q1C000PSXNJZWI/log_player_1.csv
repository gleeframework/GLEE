Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This allows for some room for negotiation and hopefully maximizes my profits.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
