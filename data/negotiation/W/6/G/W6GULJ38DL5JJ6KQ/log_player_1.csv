Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  The price is still lower than the product's value to Bob ($15,000), making it potentially attractive to him. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own, always aiming to get as close to his maximum value as possible.

I'm confident that starting with this offer will initiate a fruitful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I still believe I can achieve a better price.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's counteroffer shows his willingness to compromise. This creates an opportunity for me to counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **Strategic Play:**  By rejecting his offer, I signal my willingness to negotiate further. This can potentially lead to a higher price closer to my desired range.

I'm choosing to continue the negotiation with Bob, aiming to secure a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price of $11,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable price.
* **Fair and Reasonable:** This counteroffer presents a fair middle ground, encouraging Bob to accept while remaining above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to further negotiate. If he rejects, I can adjust my next offer accordingly.

I believe this counteroffer is a strategic move that will lead to a successful negotiation."
