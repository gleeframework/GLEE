Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a better deal than John's price of $15,000. While it would be great to get the price lower, there's no guarantee that Alice will continue to lower her price. Accepting the offer saves you $4,000 compared to John's price."
