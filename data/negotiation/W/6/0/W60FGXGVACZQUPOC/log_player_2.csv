Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than what John is offering.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John for a guaranteed lower price. Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of further price increases or a protracted negotiation process that could lead to missed opportunities."
