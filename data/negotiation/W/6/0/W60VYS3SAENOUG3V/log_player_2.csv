**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently rejected Bob's offers and is unlikely to go significantly lower than $11,050. At this point, continuing the negotiation has a low probability of resulting in a significantly better price than John's offer of $15,000. 

While Bob would save a small amount by continuing to haggle with Alice, the risk of her not budging and the potential time wasted outweighs the potential savings in this scenario."
