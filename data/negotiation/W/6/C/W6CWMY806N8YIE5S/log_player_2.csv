"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  You should try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. This strategy aims to understand Alice's flexibility and potential for a deal.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message maintains a polite and interested tone to encourage continued negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** By suggesting $8,000, I'm leaving space for Alice to counter with a price lower than her initial offer, but hopefully closer to my acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $18,000 was a bit high. However, $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, $14,000 is still higher than what John is offering. It's likely we can negotiate further with Alice to reach a price closer to our $10,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still working with a tight budget. Would you consider $10,000?  That's the absolute maximum I can afford at the moment."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Honest:** In this round, I'm being more direct about my budget limitations. By stating $10,000 as my ""absolute maximum,"" I'm signaling to Alice that this is a firm limit.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will reveal whether Alice is genuinely willing to negotiate within a range that works for me or if she's fixed on a price closer to $14,000. 
* **Maintaining Respect:** The tone remains respectful and acknowledges Alice's efforts to find common ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10,000 isn't quite enough for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $12,000? It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's closer to your price point. This would allow me to cover my costs while still leaving room for some profit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly motivated to sell and is negotiating.  While $12,000 is a decent price, we're getting closer to our target. With still several rounds to go, it's worth seeing if we can get her closer to $10,000.  The risk of her walking away is relatively low at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is tempting, but I'm really trying to stick to my budget of $10,000. How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $11,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a classic compromise by suggesting we ""split the difference."" This tactic can be effective in negotiations, as it shows a willingness to find middle ground.
* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm reiterating my $10,000 budget to remind Alice of my constraint but showing flexibility by moving slightly upwards. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The language remains positive, emphasizing fairness and a mutually beneficial solution."
