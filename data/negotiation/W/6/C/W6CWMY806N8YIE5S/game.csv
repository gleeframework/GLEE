"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $18,000 was a bit high. However, $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still working with a tight budget. Would you consider $10,000?  That's the absolute maximum I can afford at the moment.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10,000 isn't quite enough for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $12,000? It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's closer to your price point. This would allow me to cover my costs while still leaving room for some profit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is tempting, but I'm really trying to stick to my budget of $10,000. How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $11,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
