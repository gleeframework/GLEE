"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11,250. Let me know if that works for you!",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,250 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $10,750, which is closer to our middle ground. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,750 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can do $11,000, which is the same price I initially offered, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in!",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still looking for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $10,875 for the product.  This is my final offer, let me know if we can make a deal.",10875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $10,875, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I can do $11,250, but I'll also throw in a warranty and some additional support to sweeten the deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here!",11250.0,Alice,7,
