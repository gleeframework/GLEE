"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John's $8,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  He can counteroffer with a lower price, hoping to get closer to his maximum budget of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to his $8,000 limit as possible.  A counteroffer of $8,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it might entice her to negotiate further. If she rejects, Bob can still choose to go with John's offer, but this gives him a chance to potentially secure a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, Bob has been negotiating and hasn't been able to get Alice to agree to a price he's willing to pay. It's unlikely he can get her lower than $8,500, as she rejected that offer.  Since John is offering the product for $8,000, which is exactly what Bob is willing to pay, it's the most sensible decision to buy from John and end the negotiations with Alice."
