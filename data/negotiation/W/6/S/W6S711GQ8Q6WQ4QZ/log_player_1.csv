Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $135 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** It leaves room for negotiation.
* **Lower than John's offer:** It incentivizes Bob to buy rather than risk losing the product. 

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, there's a good chance he'll accept, allowing me to get a decent price while still leaving some room for future negotiation."
