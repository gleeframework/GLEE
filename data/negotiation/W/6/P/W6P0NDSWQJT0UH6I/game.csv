"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $120 for the product. Can we discuss something in the middle, like $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still more than I'm hoping to spend.  Could we meet somewhere closer to $80?  I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I've already met you halfway and you're still not willing to meet me at a price that covers my costs. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. Can we try $110?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $85, but that's the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $95, which is the lowest price I can accept for the product. If we can agree on this, I'm willing to finalize the sale.",95.0,Alice,7,
