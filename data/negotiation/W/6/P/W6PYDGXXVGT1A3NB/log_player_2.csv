"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's something that could really benefit you. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal. $12,000 is still a decent profit for Alice, as the product is worth $10,000 to her. This counteroffer shows Bob's serious intent to buy the product while also leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is a good compromise.  It's still a good price for Bob, saving him $2,000 compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation rounds that might result in a higher price or a failed deal."
