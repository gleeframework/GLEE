"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $150. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering at $130. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for Bob, while still getting me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a little more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $115. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal without having to go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close to the end, and I'm not sure if Bob will come up to my minimum price.  I'm going to sell to John. While it's not the most I could potentially get, it guarantees me my minimum price, and I don't have time for more negotiations."
