"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $110. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $105. How about $98?",98.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, $98 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $101? This is a final offer. If you're not interested at this price, I'll have to move on.",101.0,Alice,7,
