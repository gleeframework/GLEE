"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a great product that you might be interested in! I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $150, knowing the product is worth at least $100 to me. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:**  I use a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and hopefully make a counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potential price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Can you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Interest:**  Bob's message shows he's interested, which is good. However, his offer of $120 is still below my desired range.
* **Negotiation Room:** I want to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my preferred price.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially landing at a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate your offer, but $120 doesn't quite cover my costs. How about $135? I'm flexible and willing to work with you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise, coming down from $150 to $135, showing flexibility. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  I subtly mention my ""costs"" to remind Bob that the product is valuable.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""I'm flexible and willing to work with you"" encourages further dialogue and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to be within my budget. Can you meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $125 is only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price of $120, I still believe there's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** By rejecting this offer, I can make a counteroffer that might be more appealing to Bob.
* **Time is on My Side:** We're only in round 4, so I have plenty of rounds left to potentially close the deal at a price closer to $135."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a great price for the product, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer of $125 and my previous offer of $135.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the product's value by stating it's a ""great price"" and expressing confidence in its worth.
* **Direct Question:** The question ""What do you say?"" encourages Bob to make a decision or counteroffer. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, adding a subtle sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $128. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $128 is only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Time Considerations:** We are in round 6, and accepting this offer means closing the deal. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might not result in a significantly higher price and could risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **John's Offer:** While John offers $100, accepting Bob's offer gives me a $8 profit, which is better than the $0 profit from selling to John."
