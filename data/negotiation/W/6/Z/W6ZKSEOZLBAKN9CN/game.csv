"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000.  This is a fair deal for both of us, as it's the exact value you placed on the product.  I know you're a discerning buyer, and I believe this product would be a great addition to your assets. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested party ready to purchase at the same price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
