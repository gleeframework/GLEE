"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Bob's Willingness:** This first offer will give me insight into how eager Bob is to purchase and provide a baseline for future rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind John's offer of $800,000 as a fallback. I won't accept anything below that, but I have time to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than my initial ask and leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. Bob's message suggests he's willing to negotiate further. I'll counter in the next round to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm aiming for a compromise by splitting the difference between Bob's offer and my previous price. This demonstrates flexibility while still targeting a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's worth to Bob, reminding him of the long-term benefits and justifying the higher price point. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm aware that Bob might not immediately accept this offer, but it sets a strong position for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at this point. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $975,000. This offer is closer to the middle ground we're aiming for, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, showing a willingness to negotiate.  While $975,000 is tempting, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price in the next few rounds. The difference between his offer and my last counter-offer is narrowing, indicating we are nearing a potential agreement point. I'll counter-offer again to test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen. How about $1,000,000 even? This is my final offer, reflecting the value you're gaining and my own minimum price point."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm firm on this price.
* **Strong But Fair Position:** $1,000,000 is a strong, round number that allows me to maximize profit while still exceeding my minimum by a significant amount. It's also a price point that I believe Bob is likely to accept based on his negotiation patterns.
* **Time Consideration:**  We are past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  It might be time to push for closure and avoid the risk of Bob's offers stagnating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is still slightly higher than my ideal price, but I'm ready to make a final move.  I'm confident we can close this deal at $985,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $985,000 is a substantial amount and very close to my target price of $1,000,000. 
* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, suggesting he may not be willing to go higher.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through entirely. Accepting now secures a highly profitable outcome."
