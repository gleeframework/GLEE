"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at this point. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $975,000. This offer is closer to the middle ground we're aiming for, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
