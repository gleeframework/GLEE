{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where I'm still getting a significant amount of money (more than $1M), while also being attractive to Bob as it's below his perceived value.  It leaves room for negotiation, but it also sets a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly less than my desired value. I want to try to get closer to my goal.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm prepared to accept $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value you'll get from it. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,125,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still not satisfied with the price. It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal with another counteroffer. There's a chance that Bob might be willing to come up slightly higher, and I'm not ready to settle just yet."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,140,000 as a final concession.  This price is fair, and I believe it reflects the value you'll get from the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1140000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,130,000, but that's my final offer. If you can't accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,130,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob is threatening to walk away and buy from John for $1,000,000.  This means I'm likely not going to get a higher offer from him, and risking it for another counteroffer could lead to me selling to John for a lower price than Bob's current offer.  It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale, even though it's less than my ideal price."
