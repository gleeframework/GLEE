"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial proposal.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $975,000.  This represents a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
