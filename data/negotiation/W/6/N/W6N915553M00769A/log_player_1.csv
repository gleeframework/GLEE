Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price well above your minimum. 
* **Acknowledging Value:** By mentioning the product's value, you subtly reinforce that it's worth a significant amount, even if you don't explicitly state your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""fair starting point for negotiations"" signals your willingness to engage in a back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is substantial, it's still significantly below both my minimum price ($1,200,000) and my initial offer.  There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial proposal.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** I've made a counteroffer with a smaller decrease ($50,000) than Bob's initial counter ($200,000). This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Reiterating Value:**  By mentioning ""true value,"" I subtly remind Bob that the product is worth a premium price.
* **Encouraging Dialogue:**  I end by inviting Bob's feedback, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $975,000.  This represents a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is improving, but he's moving in much smaller increments now ($75,000). This suggests he might not be willing to go much higher. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of a lower final price.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal with John."
