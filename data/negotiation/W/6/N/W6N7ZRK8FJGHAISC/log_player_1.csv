Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $100 to him and at least $80 to me. I'm hoping to get as close to his value as possible while still making a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

```

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to accept such a low price yet.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to come down a bit to $90. This is still a good price for me, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a fair compromise."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to sell for $82. I will counteroffer once more to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering a final counteroffer of $87. This is very close to my minimum and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's previous offer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is the best I've received so far, and it's only $5 less than my counteroffer. It's better than selling to John for $80, so I'll accept."
