Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is within Bob's budget and is a better deal than John's price of $100.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
