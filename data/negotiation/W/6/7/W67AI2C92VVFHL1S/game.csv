"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find common ground and make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. But $875,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
