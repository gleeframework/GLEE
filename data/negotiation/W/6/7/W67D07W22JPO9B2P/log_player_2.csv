"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is too high. I can definitely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little too high for me though. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's generally good negotiation strategy to start with a low offer, especially when you have time for multiple rounds. This offer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get Alice to counter with a price closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, but $100 is still significantly more than I want to pay, and quite a ways from my initial offer.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more movement from her side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about $70? That's a fair price for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:**  By increasing my offer to $70, I'm demonstrating  that I'm willing to move closer to Alice's price.
* **Stay below budget:** This offer keeps me well within my $80 budget, allowing room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Appear reasonable:**  $70 feels like a reasonable compromise point, potentially encouraging Alice to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $90 is still above my budget.  We're getting into the later rounds, so I need to start pushing a bit harder towards my target price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get her closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work. How about we settle this right now at $75?  That's the best I can do."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm still negotiating, but I'm also drawing a line in the sand at $75. This conveys that I'm serious but not willing to exceed my budget.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying ""settle this right now"", I'm adding a bit of pressure and suggesting that this is my final offer. This might encourage Alice to accept rather than risk losing the sale.
* **Still Below John's Price:** Even at $75, I'm still saving money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $75. I can offer it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging significantly, and we're running out of rounds. Her latest offer of $95 is too far from my $75 limit.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up with no deal at all. Buying from John for $80 is the most sensible option now to ensure I get the product within my budget."
