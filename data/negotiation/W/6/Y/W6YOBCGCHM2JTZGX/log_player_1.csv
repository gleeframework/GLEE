Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a bit above Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open-ended, inviting Bob to respond. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Value:** I want to get as close to my minimum value ($15,000) as possible, but I'm aware Bob might be unwilling to pay that much.
* **Flexibility:** By starting with a higher price, I have room to negotiate downwards and potentially still secure a good deal.
* **Back-Up Plan:**  John's offer serves as a safety net, ensuring I won't lose out on my minimum value if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That price is a little high for me though. How about $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000, and even below the value of the product to Bob ($10,000). Accepting this offer would be a major loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's interested.  There's room for further negotiation, and I might be able to secure a better price with a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a good back-up.**  If the negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale to John at my minimum price.

**Next Step:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  $8,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $10,500. This is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my starting price, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price for both of us"". This emphasizes that I'm seeking a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $10,500 is still above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential further negotiation if necessary.

**Strategy:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm trying to bridge the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer.
* **Staying Firm:**  I'm not going to accept a price below my minimum value, but I'm open to compromise.
* **Maintaining Open Communication:**  I'm keeping the message positive and open to encourage further dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to. How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my desired price than his previous offer.  While still below my ideal value, it's a significant improvement.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price,  I'm not sure I'll be able to get much more from Bob. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I'll have to sell to John at a lower profit. 

**Strategy:**

* **Accepting the Offer:** This seems like a reasonable outcome considering the negotiation history. It's a good compromise and a decent profit for me.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting the offer ensures a sale and avoids the potential for a longer negotiation with an uncertain outcome."
