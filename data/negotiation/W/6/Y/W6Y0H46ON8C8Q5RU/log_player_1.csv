Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for a price of $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know this product is worth $800,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $850,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm eager to sell the product, $700,000 is too far below my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good price. While $700,000 is a bit low, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $800,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
