"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth $1500000 to you, and I know it will be a great asset for your business. To start, I'm proposing a price of $1750000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price within our 10 rounds.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is higher than my budget.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it.  Let's find a middle ground to make this work for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still outside of my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $1550000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and leaves room for you to make a profit.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
