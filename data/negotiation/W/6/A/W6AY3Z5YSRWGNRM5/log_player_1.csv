Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I know it will be a great asset for your business. To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price within our 10 rounds."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is higher than my budget.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it.  Let's find a middle ground to make this work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not desperate.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still outside of my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $1550000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and leaves room for you to make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  This is a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
