"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm confident it will be worth far more than that to you in the long run.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
