"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and also lets Bob know I value the product highly. I'll be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response, but I want to see if I can get a good deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum value of $800,000. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is still a significant profit for me and hopefully close enough to entice Bob to accept. It also shows I'm willing to negotiate but won't give away the product for a price I'm not comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming to get as close to $800,000 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a compromise, and hopefully, it'll be enough to persuade Bob to close the deal.  If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John at $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$725,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 740000}
```

I'm going to counter with $740,000. This is a small increase from Bob's offer, but it's the last offer I'm willing to make before selling to John.  Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal."
