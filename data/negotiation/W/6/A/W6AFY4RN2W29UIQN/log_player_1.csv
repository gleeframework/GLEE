Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I believe it offers you excellent value at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""excellent value,"" you're subtly anchoring the price in Bob's mind and implying the product might be worth even more.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  Ending with ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially counter-offer if the initial price is too high.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, aiming higher with Bob first is strategically sound. You can always lower the price later if needed."
