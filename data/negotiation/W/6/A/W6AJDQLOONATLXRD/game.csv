"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
