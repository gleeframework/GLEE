"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  This product is worth $8,000 to you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the value you've placed on it.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000, which is a fair compromise.  This would be a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
