Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to invest closer to $1,000,000, but I have to balance that with the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000.

We're still a ways off from my target price. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough call, as it's Alice's final offer. However, I'm still willing to hold out a bit longer to see if she'll budge a little closer to my budget.  There's still room to negotiate before I have to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and my last offer of $1,150,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,112,500. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has shown she is unwilling to meet my budget. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll come down significantly enough to justify the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer. Buying from John ensures I stay within my $1,000,000 limit."
