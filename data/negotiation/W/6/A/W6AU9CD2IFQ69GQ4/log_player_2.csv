"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. Since you don't know her value, you have no information to determine if this is a good deal.  Rejecting allows you to see if she's willing to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A million dollars is a substantial discount from her initial offer, and it will give us a good starting point to see how much she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $1,250,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price point. There's still room for improvement, and I'm not in a rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be appealing to her while still staying within my desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $1,200,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'm going to keep negotiating, especially since I have a safety net in John's offer. I'm optimistic that I can get Alice down to my target price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer again, but by a smaller margin this time. $1,150,000 is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing that I'm willing to meet her halfway. I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can reach a price that works for both of us."
