"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know has a lot of value for you. My starting price is $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but her starting price is $1,000,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds and can make counteroffers, so it's worth trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer starts the negotiation with a significant reduction. It shows you're serious about getting a good price but are still open to discussion.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** $900,000 is still within your budget and leaves room for a few more rounds of negotiation. 
* **Sets a clear price point:**  The counteroffer explicitly states your target price, giving Alice a concrete starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product holds for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work towards a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high.** While it's closer to your target, it's still $50,000 more than your initial counteroffer.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You have 7 rounds remaining, and there's a good chance you can squeeze out a better price. 
* **Going to Jhon is still a last resort.**  It's always better to try and get the best deal possible from the primary seller."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's keep the momentum going."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This shows Alice that you're willing to meet her halfway and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Maintaining momentum:**  The message emphasizes the desire to reach a deal, encouraging Alice to continue negotiating rather than backing away.
* **Still within your budget:** $925,000 is still a good price for you, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point about splitting the difference, but I need to be closer to $950,000 to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to go down to $940,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value to you while ensuring I get a reasonable return. Let's find common ground and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  While her offer has come down, it's still above your desired price point.
* **You're in a strong position.**  You have several rounds remaining, and you've shown willingness to negotiate.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  You're still closer to a deal with Alice than with John.

**Counteroffer (Next Round):**

You could counter with $930,000.  This continues the pattern of splitting the difference and shows you're serious about finding a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up to $930,000. This is a fair compromise that meets us both halfway.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 930000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference again:**  This tactic has worked well so far, and it shows Alice that you're committed to finding a middle ground.

* **Still a good price for you:**  $930,000 is within your budget and leaves a little room for negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $930,000. Let's split the difference one last time. I'm willing to accept $935,000 for the product. This price ensures both of us get a fair deal and allows us to move forward efficiently. Let's close this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $935,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target price.** $935,000 is only $5,000 more than your last counteroffer.
* **You have limited time.** You only have 3 rounds left, and rejecting this offer could risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price. 
* **It's a fair compromise.**  This price represents a significant savings compared to John's offer, and it likely gives Alice a good enough profit margin.

While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, accepting this offer is the most prudent move given the limited time remaining and the potential for a much worse outcome."
