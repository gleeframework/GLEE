"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I see your point about splitting the difference, but I need to be closer to $950,000 to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to go down to $940,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value to you while ensuring I get a reasonable return. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,
