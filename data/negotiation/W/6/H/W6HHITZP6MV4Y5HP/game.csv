"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle? I can let it go for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
