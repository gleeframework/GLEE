{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'll see what Bob's reaction is and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $18,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that this will be a good enough price to get Bob to agree, but still provides me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $17,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to try to get a slightly higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,500. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. I hope this will be enough to finally get a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $17,000 is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price.  I've been negotiating for a while now and I'm not confident I can get a significantly higher price from Bob. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation."
