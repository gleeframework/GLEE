"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
The product is worth $12,000 to me, and Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything less than my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply not enough. My minimum price is $12,000. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $11,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and accept $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10800 for it. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've had 5 rounds of negotiations with Bob and we haven't been able to come to an agreement.  While he's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm starting to run out of time and don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  John is a sure thing, and I'm confident that I can get my minimum price from him."
