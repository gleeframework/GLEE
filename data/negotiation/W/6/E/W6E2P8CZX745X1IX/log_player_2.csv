Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is back to her initial price, but I've already made significant progress in the negotiation. Accepting this offer would still save me a considerable amount compared to buying from John. With only 3 rounds left, I risk losing the opportunity to buy the product at a good price. It's better to close the deal now and save the money."
