"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to your limit than John's price, you can still try to negotiate a better deal with Alice.  There's a chance you can get the price down to $800,000 or closer by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is only slightly lower than her initial offer and is still above your maximum budget.  At this point, you've already tried to negotiate and Alice has shown a reluctance to come down to your desired price. Buying from John guarantees the product for your maximum budget."
