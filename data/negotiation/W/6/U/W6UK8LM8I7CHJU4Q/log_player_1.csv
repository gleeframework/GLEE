"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate.  My asking price is $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum price of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation and suggests I'm open to a deal. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to establish rapport with Bob.
* **Focus on Value:**  I hint at the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to secure a price as close to my minimum as possible within the 10 rounds.  The first offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and set the negotiation framework."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and significantly less than the $10,000 I initially offered.
* **Selling to John is always an option.** Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I can always secure a better deal by selling to him if the negotiation with Bob fails.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially reach a more favorable price within the remaining rounds.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my negotiating leverage.  I'll now counter-offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a compromise before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with a compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $10,000 to $9,500, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but closer to his budget.
* **Maintain value and appeal:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my counter-offer.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** I'm using positive language and emphasizing a desire to find a mutually beneficial solution.

**Strategy:**

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Test Bob's willingness to increase his offer:**  If he's genuinely interested, he may accept or counter-offer closer to my price.
* **Maintain my negotiating position:** While I'm compromising, I'm not significantly lowering my price, preserving my leverage for future rounds.
* **Increase the chances of a deal:** By showing flexibility and a willingness to find common ground, I'm increasing the chances of a successful negotiation before having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I respect your need to maintain the product's value, I still believe we can reach an agreement within my budget. I am willing to pay $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While still below my desired $12,000, Bob's offer of $9,000 is only $3,000 less.  This represents a significant increase from his initial offer and demonstrates his willingness to negotiate.
* **Time is a factor:** We're already in round 4, and with 6 rounds remaining, there's a risk that I could exhaust my negotiation time without reaching a satisfactory price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not in a desperate position.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a deal with Bob and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise considering the time remaining and the potential of selling to John."
