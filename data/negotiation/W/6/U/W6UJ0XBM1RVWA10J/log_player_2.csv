Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand this is as low as you're willing to go, and I appreciate that. However, I'm afraid $13,500 is still pushing my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to squeeze out every last dollar, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a stalemate. I'll make one more offer, and it's a compromise: $13,250. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, she's unlikely to go much lower than $13,250. You've consistently aimed for a price around $12,500-$12,750, and she hasn't budged much.  

At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are minimal compared to the guaranteed savings of buying from John. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, saving you at least $3,250 compared to Alice's last offer."
