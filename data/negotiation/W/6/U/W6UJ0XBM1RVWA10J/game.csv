"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about $12,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is as low as you're willing to go, and I appreciate that. However, I'm afraid $13,500 is still pushing my budget.  Would you consider $12,750? It's a small difference, but it could be the deciding factor for me.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to squeeze out every last dollar, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a stalemate. I'll make one more offer, and it's a compromise: $13,250. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,7,
