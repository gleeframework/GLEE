"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Based on its value and potential, I'm asking for $1500000.  I'm confident this price reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussion. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $1200000, which is the price I've found from another seller. Is there any flexibility in your price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1350000 to facilitate this transaction. This price still reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd like to propose a price of $1250000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
