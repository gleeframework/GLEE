"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for considering my product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a price of $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You're willing to pay up to $10,000, but Alice is happy to get $8,000.  There's room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to go up to $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,500. How about $8,750? It's a great compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  $8,750 is a good deal for you, saving you $1,250 compared to John's offer and still giving Alice a profit above her minimum."
