"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows you a good profit margin while also giving me a great deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I would like to accommodate your budget, I must maintain a reasonable profit margin. I am therefore proposing a revised price of $10,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our interests.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9,750. This would still give you a very healthy profit, and it's a price I'm confident I can manage.  Let's make this deal happen!",9750.0,Bob,4,
