Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows you a good profit margin while also giving me a great deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Bob's offer:
