"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire an item that holds significant value for you at a price that reflects its worth while allowing us to achieve a satisfactory return. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal.  He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. He has a lot of room to negotiate since he's willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice only needs to get $8,000."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows you a good profit margin while also giving me a great deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I would like to accommodate your budget, I must maintain a reasonable profit margin. I am therefore proposing a revised price of $10,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a strong position. He can likely get the product for less than $10,000. Rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer will likely lead to a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9,750. This would still give you a very healthy profit, and it's a price I'm confident I can manage.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9750}
