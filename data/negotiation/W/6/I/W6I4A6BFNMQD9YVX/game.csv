"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't afford $2500000. I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1750000.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1750000 is still outside of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1250000. Let's try to close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
