"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your needs perfectly. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $80. Would you like to make this investment in enhancing your experience with our product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer is technically within your budget, there's no incentive to accept it immediately. Since you know John is willing to sell the product for the same price, rejecting Alice's offer opens up the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice at a lower price."
