"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $150. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within a reasonable range. I'm hoping to gauge her willingness to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $60, which is still a good deal for me. I'm willing to accept this offer as it's a significant saving compared to buying from John for $150. There's still a chance I could get a better price, but I'm not willing to risk losing a good deal and having to pay more from John."
