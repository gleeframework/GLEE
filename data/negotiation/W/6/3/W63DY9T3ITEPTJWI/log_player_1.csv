{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  While I'd like to get a bit more, Bob's counteroffers are getting closer to my minimum price.  However, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit."
