"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  Here's why I'm choosing this approach:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A higher initial offer gives me more room to compromise later. 
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob rejects this offer, it tells me he likely values the product less than I hoped, but it also gives me an idea of his maximum price point. 
* **The ""John"" safety net:** The knowledge that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me confidence to be more aggressive in negotiations with Bob.

I'll be ready to analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my starting price and below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident that I can make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,200,000. Here's my reasoning:

* **Compromise, but not too much:**  This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:**  I want to see how Bob reacts to this offer. If he accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, it gives me a better sense of his true value for the product. 
* **Time is still on my side:**  I have 7 rounds left, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob's offers improve.  

I'm confident that this counteroffer is reasonable and will lead to a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can do better. I'm not in a rush to close the deal, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. 

Here's why I'm rejecting Bob's offer:

* **John's offer:** I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation room:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, and I believe I can get him to go higher.
* **Time is on my side:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have ample time to continue the negotiation. 

I'm confident that with a well-crafted counteroffer, I can secure a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,100,000. Here's my reasoning:

* **Finding the middle ground:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's current offer of $900,000. It shows I'm willing to be flexible and find a price we can both agree on.
* **Testing Bob's limits:** I want to see if Bob is willing to go a little higher. If he accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, it gives me a clearer understanding of his top price point.
* **Remaining patient:** I still have 5 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to close the deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating until we reach a mutually acceptable price.

I'm confident that this offer will be well-received by Bob and will bring us closer to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant. I'm not desperate to sell and want to see if I can achieve a better price. Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **John's offer:**  Remember, I can sell to John for $1,000,000, which is still a more desirable outcome.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob's offer shows he's willing to increase his price, which means there's still room for negotiation.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 4 rounds remaining, allowing me to continue exploring options.

By rejecting, I can make another counteroffer in the next round and see if I can get closer to my desired price range."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000. Here's my reasoning:

* **Closing the gap:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's current offer of $950,000. It shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement but still not willing to budge too much.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to go a little higher. This is likely our last chance to get a price above my minimum acceptable price before I might have to settle for John's offer.
* **Time is running out:** We're down to the last 3 rounds, so I need to be more decisive. 

I'm confident that this offer will be appealing to Bob, given his increasing offers, and will lead to a successful deal. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price and equal to what John is offering.  Given the limited rounds remaining, it makes sense to accept. Here's why:

* **No risk, no reward:** There's no guarantee I can get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds. I might end up having to sell to John for the same amount.
* **Time pressure:**  We are down to our last two rounds. If I reject, it's possible Bob will get frustrated and walk away, leaving me with no deal. 
* **Meeting my minimum:**  $1,000,000 satisfies my minimum requirement and is a reasonable outcome given the negotiation process.

While it would be great to get more, accepting this offer ensures I achieve my financial goal within the allotted rounds."
