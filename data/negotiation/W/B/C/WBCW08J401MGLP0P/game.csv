"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $11,000, so I'd like to offer $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
