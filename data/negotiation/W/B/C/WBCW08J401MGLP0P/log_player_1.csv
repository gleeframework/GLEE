Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  He's willing to pay $10,000, so $12,000 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're comfortable selling for at least $15,000, so you have space to lower the price if needed.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, and it gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counter his offer or sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer and get a quick sale, it's not worth sacrificing that much money. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm still holding firm to my desire to get as close to my $15,000 goal as possible.  This counteroffer moves me closer to Bob's price while still leaving room for further negotiation.  If he rejects this offer, I'll consider selling to John, but I'll try to see if I can squeeze out a better deal with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $11,000, so I'd like to offer $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob, or I can always sell to John.  I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise: it's closer to Bob's offer, but still closer to my target price.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't give away the product for a significantly low price.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good compromise and we can finally close the deal."
