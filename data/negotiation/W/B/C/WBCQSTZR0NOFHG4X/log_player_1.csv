Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for Bob to make a profit. It's a good starting point to gauge his interest and see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a substantial profit.  This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while maintaining my desired value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is close to my ideal price point.  It's worth accepting to secure a good deal and avoid further negotiation."
