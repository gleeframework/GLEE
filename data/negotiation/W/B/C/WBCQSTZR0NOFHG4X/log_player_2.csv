"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $800,000. This means there's room for negotiation and a potential for a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. It's a good starting point for negotiations, and will hopefully encourage Alice to counter with a price closer to the midpoint between her value and Bob's maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still potential for a lower price, especially since Alice rejected Bob's previous counteroffer, indicating a willingness to negotiate further.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's previous offer of $950,000 was rejected. This means Alice is likely willing to accept something closer to $1,000,000.  Increasing the offer to $1,000,000  shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for Alice to make a profit."
