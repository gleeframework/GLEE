Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point given that I don't know Bob's valuation. I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $10,000 is not a price I can accept.  I will counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but also that I'm not willing to sell for his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far too low. I've already lowered my price significantly, and I'm not willing to go lower. At this point, it's better to sell to John for $15,000 and ensure I at least get my minimum desired value for the product."
