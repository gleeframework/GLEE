"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's a good starting point to negotiate, but it's not acceptable at this stage.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's value, your starting price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.
