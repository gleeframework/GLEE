Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After all, I'm not sure what he's willing to pay, and I want to test the waters.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 950,000}

I'm starting with a relatively high price, but not too high, as I want to leave room for negotiation. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a significant amount. Since I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, I think I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer, but still lower than my initial offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
{""counteroffer"": 875,000}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial price, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I think I'll reject his offer again and try to negotiate further.

I'll send Bob a new counteroffer that's slightly higher than his latest offer.

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me at a higher price!"

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is getting closer to his initial offer, and I'm starting to think that he's not willing to pay much more. I've already rejected his previous offers, and I'm not sure if I want to continue negotiating further.

However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $780,000. I'll reject his offer again and send a new counteroffer that's slightly higher than his latest offer.

However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $785,000. I've already accepted that I won't get my initial price of $950,000, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.
