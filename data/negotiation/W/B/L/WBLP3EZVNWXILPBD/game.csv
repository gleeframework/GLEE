"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value this product brings. Let's work towards an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and it's also the price John is offering.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
