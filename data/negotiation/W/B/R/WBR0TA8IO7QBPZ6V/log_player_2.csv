The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice's offer is $120. I can do better than that. I will try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering $90 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $80 to me and $150 to Alice."

Alice is not budging on her price, and it's clear we are not going to reach an agreement. It's time to move on and buy the product from John for $80."
