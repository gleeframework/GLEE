"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering your own value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low. Given the significant value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $975,000.  This offer reflects the value of the product for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $975,000 is still not quite there.  Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price that accounts for the value of the product for both of us, and it gives us a chance to close the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
