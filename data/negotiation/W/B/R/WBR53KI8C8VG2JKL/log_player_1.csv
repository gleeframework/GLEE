Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could greatly benefit you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $10,000, but that doesn't directly influence my initial offer.  
* **Aiming High:** I start with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation and even higher than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Justification:** While the offer is high, I'm providing a message that highlights the ""significant value"" the product offers. This aims to justify the price, even if subjectively.
* **Backup Plan (John):** I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, acting as a strong safety net. This allows me to be more ambitious with my initial offer to Bob.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Ideal scenario, I maximize my profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  We engage in a back-and-forth, potentially settling on a price between $15,000 and $19,000.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I move on to John and secure my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit while acknowledging the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
