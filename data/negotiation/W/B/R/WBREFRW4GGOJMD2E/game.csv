"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree your product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be open to considering $700,000? I feel that's a fair price reflecting both the value and my budgetary limitations.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still believe our product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer a price of $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and acknowledges your budgetary limitations. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close to what I can manage.  I'd be willing to go to $750,000 to make this deal happen.  That's a firm offer, as I need to consider my other options if we can't find agreement.",750000.0,Bob,6,
