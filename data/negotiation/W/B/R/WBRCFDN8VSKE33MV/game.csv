"I'm very interested in the product, but $8500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. Can you meet me at that price?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To accommodate your budget while still valuing the product's true worth, I would like to propose a price of $7500 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the original price and your offer.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $7500 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $6000. Can you consider that price?",6000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Bob. In light of your proposal, I'd like to extend a counteroffer of $7000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value it brings and your budget constraints. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",7000.0,Alice,5,

This reflects a reasonable compromise between our positions and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",6500.0,Alice,7,
