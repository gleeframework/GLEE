I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good margin while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to get the deal done,  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum threshold. I hope Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good deal. Bob seems unwilling to budge much further.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is more than I'd get from Bob. I'm going to sell to John and avoid any further risk with Bob."
