"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture. However, given the value of the product to me is less than $1200000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $975000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
