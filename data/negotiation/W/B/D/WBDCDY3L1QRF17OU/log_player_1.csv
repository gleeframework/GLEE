Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you are willing to make a deal, but not give it away.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture. However, given the value of the product to me is less than $1200000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, I believe we can do better. Let's see if we can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
