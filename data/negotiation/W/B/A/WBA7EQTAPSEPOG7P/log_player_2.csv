"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still too high for him. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. Would that be something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  He's willing to keep negotiating and see if he can get a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $11,500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $11,500. How about we try $11,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has already made a counteroffer of $11,000, and Alice has offered $11,250, which is a reasonable compromise.  At this point, it's likely that Alice won't go lower, and Bob can save $3,750 by accepting the offer. Buying from John for $15,000 is a less desirable option."
