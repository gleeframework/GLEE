I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product.  However, $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly lower than your asking price but still leaves you with a healthy profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
