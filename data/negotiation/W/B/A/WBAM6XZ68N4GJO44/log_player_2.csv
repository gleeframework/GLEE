"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above the product's worth to her ($10,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product.  However, $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly lower than your asking price but still leaves you with a healthy profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,500, which would be $11,250. This is a fair price that still leaves room for a good profit, but also takes into account your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but still above the product's worth to her ($10,000). I believe I can still negotiate a better price, particularly since I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if necessary.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation and see if I can get Alice to come down further."
