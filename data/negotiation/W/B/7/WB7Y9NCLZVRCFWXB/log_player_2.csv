Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but $650,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects its value to you, while also being a good deal for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Even though Alice is coming down in price, it's still worth seeing if I can negotiate a better deal before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $725,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is holding firm, and this price is below my maximum budget. It's better to take the deal now rather than risk the negotiation going sour and having to buy from John at full price."
