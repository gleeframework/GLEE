"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $105. This is still a great price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is my absolute minimum. It's a fair price for the value of the product, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's close this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,6,
