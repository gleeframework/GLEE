"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to me is at least $10000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $15000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is still a good price considering my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $9500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad to see that you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you're placing on it. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10000 for the product, as this is a fair price considering the value we've both placed on it. Let's find a way to close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
