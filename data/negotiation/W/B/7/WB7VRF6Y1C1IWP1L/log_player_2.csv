# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to reject the offer and see if you can get a lower price.  $9,000 is above your budget, and you have 9 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to come down to $7,500? "", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8200. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down a bit, but you can still try to negotiate further. You're still only willing to pay $8,000 or less.  Let's see if we can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Would you consider that final price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
