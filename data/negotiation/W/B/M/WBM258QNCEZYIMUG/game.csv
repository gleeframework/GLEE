"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm starting the negotiations at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in your product,  $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to offer $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while still staying within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum price point.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm happy to offer $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  Let's bridge this gap. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it significantly discounts the value while ensuring a fair deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While it's getting closer to my range, $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm going to push my budget to the limit and offer $950,000. This feels like a realistic price point for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there. I appreciate you working with me on this. To show I'm serious about closing the deal, I'll come down slightly to $975,000. This is a significant compromise and my final offer.  Let me know if you're ready to agree.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $975,000.  It's getting close, but I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm going to offer $925,000 as my final counteroffer.  This is my absolute limit, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,8,
