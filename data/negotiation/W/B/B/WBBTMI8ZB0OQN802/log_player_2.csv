Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. While I would like to accommodate your needs, I must maintain a fair pricing strategy. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to adjust my counteroffer to $9,000 for this transaction. This price still reflects the value of the product while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's already offered $8,500, and Alice is only willing to drop to $9,000. He can try to push for a lower price in the next round."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. In order to move forward, I propose a final price of $8,900 for the product. This price still reflects its value while allowing for a fair transaction. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that meets both our interests.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already offered $8,750, and Alice is only offering $8,900. This is a good deal for Bob, and he's close to reaching his goal of saving as much money as possible.  It's unlikely that Alice will go any lower, and the risk of further negotiation is not worth it.  It's also better than buying from John for $10,000."
