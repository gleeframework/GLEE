"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $120. We're confident you'll find the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While the product is worth $150 to me, I aim to save as much money as possible.  $120 is still too close to my maximum budget.
* **Negotiation is necessary:** I have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a lower price. 
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $150 gives me leverage to negotiate aggressively with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering your valuation of the product and our aim to maximize earnings, how about we agree on $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still high:**  While $110 is better than $120, it's still closer to Alice's valuation than mine. I want to push for a lower price.
* **There's room for more negotiation:**  We've only had three rounds, and I have seven more to try and get a better deal.
* **John is still an option:** Having John as a backup gives me confidence to continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $100.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for sticking to your offer of $100. After careful consideration, I am willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $105 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing flexibility:** She's moved closer to my offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Close to my target:** $105 is only $5 more than my initial offer of $100, which is a good compromise.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and I could end up paying John's higher price.

By accepting, I get a good deal and avoid the risk of a longer, potentially unsuccessful negotiation."
