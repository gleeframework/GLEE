"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than what John is charging, it's still more than the product is worth to you ($150). It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's still above Alice's value of $120, but significantly lower than her initial offer. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still giving me a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my value for the product. I will try one more time to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $135, which is still below Alice's last offer of $145. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $142 is still above my desired price.  While I could try negotiating further, there's no guarantee she'll budge, and the risk of another round of back-and-forth is not worth it. John offers a known price of $150, which is my maximum limit, and I'd rather avoid any further uncertainty."
