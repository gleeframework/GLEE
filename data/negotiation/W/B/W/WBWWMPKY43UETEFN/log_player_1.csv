Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and also sets a clear expectation of the value I place on the product. It's important to remember that I can always fall back to John's offer if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than half of my minimum value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $900,000. This is still a significant amount more than Bob's offer and leaves room for potential negotiation. I'm trying to find a compromise that's fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $600,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I need to be closer to my goal. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $850,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's still above my minimum value of $800,000.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still not close to my desired price. It's time to cut my losses and move on. John is a guaranteed sale at $800,000, which is my minimum value. I can't risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with less than that."
