"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer.  $1,000,000 is more than your maximum budget of $800,000. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you want to pay. You should reject her offer and make another counteroffer. There's still room for negotiation before you need to buy from John."
