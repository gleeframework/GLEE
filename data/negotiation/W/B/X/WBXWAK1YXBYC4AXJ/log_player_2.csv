"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I think it's a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and a good profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get it for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $13,000?  That's still a good profit for you, and a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a modest counteroffer, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  Offering $13,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
