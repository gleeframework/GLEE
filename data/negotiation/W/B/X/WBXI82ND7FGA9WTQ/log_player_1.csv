{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from Alice.  How about we settle at $85 and call it a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$85 is a decent price, and Bob seems willing to close the deal.  Rather than risk another round of negotiation and possibly ending up with John's offer of $100, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
