"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to $13,500.  This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it'll deliver excellent value for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now $13,500, which is a good price for Bob considering his maximum budget is $15,000.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's a good time to accept and avoid further risk."
