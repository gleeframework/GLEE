Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done some research and I believe the market value of the product is lower than you think. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. It's the maximum I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm going to see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you've done your research, but my product is unique and offers significant value.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $15,000. I'm going to see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price a little further to $12,500.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  If you're still interested, let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the price I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold. I've already had 5 rounds of negotiations and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer from Bob. Instead of continuing with the negotiation and risking getting a lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. This guarantees I will get my minimum price."
