You can do better than $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

I'm offering $9,000. It's still a good deal for Alice since she values it at $15,000, and it's within my budget."

I'm offering $10,000. This is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both of us."

Alice is getting stubborn, and while $10,500 is closer to my budget, it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation. I'm going to buy from John for $8,000, it's a sure thing and within my budget."
