"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, and I know it's worth that much to you too. I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for a price you're comfortable with, and I'll get a bit more than my minimum. Let me know what you think!",16000.0,Alice,1,
