,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $115.  What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price given the value of the product to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $125 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
