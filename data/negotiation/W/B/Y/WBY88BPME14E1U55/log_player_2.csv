"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $15,000 to us. Given its high quality and unique features, we believe it would be worth $12,000 to you based on your needs. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, my budget for this purchase is $10,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from it.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
