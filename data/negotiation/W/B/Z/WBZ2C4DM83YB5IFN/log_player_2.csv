"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate down closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $1,000,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm comfortable with. We'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000.  Would you be open to that?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to move much further from her $1,250,000 offer.  Since we have the option to buy from John at $1,200,000, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings."
