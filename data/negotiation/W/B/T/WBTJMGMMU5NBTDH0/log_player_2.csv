# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's flowery language about ""mutual growth and prosperity"" doesn't change the facts. Here's why rejecting makes sense:

* **Your Limit:** You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000.
* **Alice's Needs:** Alice values the product at $1,000,000, meaning there's room for negotiation.
* **John's Price:** John acts as your safety net. You KNOW you can get the product for $1,500,000 if needed.

By rejecting Alice's first offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.  Alice is likely to come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale entirely."
