"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that I believe is fair and mutually beneficial.  I'm confident that it will be a valuable asset for you, given its worth to you. Please consider my offer of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Bob knows the product is worth significantly less to Alice, so he can try to get a better deal."
