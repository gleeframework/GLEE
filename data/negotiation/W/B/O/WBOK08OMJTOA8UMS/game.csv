"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest in the product,  $1300000 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm proposing a price of $1350000.  This would allow me to comfortably reach my desired selling point while still leaving room for us to find a mutually agreeable price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1280000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1280000.0,Bob,4,
