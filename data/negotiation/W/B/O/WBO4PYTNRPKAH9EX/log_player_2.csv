# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique product to you. It holds significant value to us, and we believe it could also be a valuable asset for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This reflects its value to me and allows us to move forward with a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, we would like to counter your offer with a price of $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my budget. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement. There's still room for negotiation and I can always buy from John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,100,000 is still slightly out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to make a reasonable deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand your position and are willing to consider it. In response, we propose a price of $1,075,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise between our expectations and your budget, while still providing a reasonable return for us. We hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly in price, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. At this point, I've already spent several rounds negotiating and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a deal that fits my budget.  It's better to be certain and go with John's offer of $1,000,000."
