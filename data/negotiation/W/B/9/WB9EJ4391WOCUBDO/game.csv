"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $12,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm sorry, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to have to pass on your offer and explore other options.
