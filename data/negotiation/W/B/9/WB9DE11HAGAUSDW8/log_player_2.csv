"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far too high, and Bob can get the same product from John for $10,000.  There's no reason to accept such a high price when a better option exists."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is far too high. I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for this product.  It's the maximum I'm comfortable spending.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is closer to the market value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $17,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob knows he can get the same product from John for $10,000. There's no reason to accept a price that's so close to John's offer when he's not sure if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  While $12,000 is still below what I'd like, I'm willing to accept $14,500. This is a very competitive offer and a fair compromise.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Although it's lower than her previous offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, there's no reason to accept a higher price, even if it's lower than Alice's previous offers.  Bob can continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $14,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
