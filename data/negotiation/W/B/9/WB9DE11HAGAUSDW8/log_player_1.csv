Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $14,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly closer to your $15,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer of $13,000 would mean a $2,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's strategically better to cut your losses and secure the $15,000 from John."
