# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting closer to the price you're comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $105? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $105, and your goal is to spend no more than $100. John offers a guaranteed price within your budget."
