Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation.  Here's why I chose this price:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below my minimum:** It leaves me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, without going below my minimum acceptable price.
* **It's a significant discount:** This incentivizes Bob to accept the offer quickly, rather than risking losing the opportunity. 

Remember, the goal is to get the best price, but also to keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't go below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product.  It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident its true value is much higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000 for the following reasons:

* **Still above my minimum:** This ensures I don't sell below my desired price.
* **Significantly higher than Bob's offer:**  It demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a drastically low price.
* **Middle ground:** This shows I'm willing to compromise and makes it easier for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise that much.  It's clear that we're too far apart in our valuations, and it's not worth continuing this negotiation.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
