"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at a price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be useful, but not at that cost. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This product offers significant value, and I believe this revised price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $13,500? I think that would be a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
