Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be useful, but not at that cost. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $13,500? I think that would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.
