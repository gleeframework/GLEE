Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he negotiates, you know he's interested. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale with John at $8,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob."
