"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

The product is worth $80 to Bob. Alice's offer is $120, which is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $85. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

While $105 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before accepting or buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit out of your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $100. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident that this is the best price I can offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

Alice's final offer is still $20 above Bob's maximum budget.  Since John is offering the product for $80, Bob should choose to buy the product from John and save himself $20."
