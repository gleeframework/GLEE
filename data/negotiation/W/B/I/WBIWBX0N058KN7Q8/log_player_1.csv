Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's estimated value, but still within a range that allows for negotiation. This gives me room to maneuver while still leaving a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I think that's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's try to find a solution we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still quite large for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,175,000. Let's see if we can find some middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to keep negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still not workable for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
