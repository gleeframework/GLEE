"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more. Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. Let's find a middle ground and get this deal done!",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,900 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,800? This would be a fair price for both of us and get this deal finalized.",10800.0,Bob,6,
