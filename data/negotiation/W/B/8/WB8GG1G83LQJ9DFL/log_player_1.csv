Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth so much to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what Bob values the product at ($10,000). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Room to Compromise:**  The price of $13,000 leaves room for me to potentially lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a backup buyer who will pay my minimum price of $15,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, great! If not, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $11,000 for it. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **John is a Safer Bet:** John is guaranteed to pay $15,000, which is a much better outcome for me.
* **Negotiation Risk:**  Further negotiation with Bob could result in him lowering his offer even more, or it could be a lengthy process.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer to Bob:** I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price. However, I'll keep John's offer in mind and be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't come closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm willing to compromise a little by coming down from $13,000 to $12,000.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer tests whether Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm still mindful of John's offer and will not hesitate to walk away if Bob doesn't come closer to $12,000. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, great!  If not, I'll have to decide whether to accept his next counteroffer or go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I believe $11,000 is still a reasonable price given the value of the product to me. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close But Not Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is closer to my desired price, but it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Further negotiation with Bob could lead to more time wasted and a lower final price. 
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired $15,000, providing a certain and profitable outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalizing the Deal:** I'll accept John's offer and finalize the sale."
