"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,250 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer, I need to be a bit higher to make this worthwhile. Let's aim for $13,500. This price acknowledges your budget while ensuring I get a fair return on this product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still working with a tight budget, though.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal at $12,800. It's a good price for both of us, and we can move forward without any further delay. Let's make this happen.",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,800 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $13,150?  This would ensure a fair deal for both of us and allows us to finalize this transaction.",13150.0,Alice,7,
