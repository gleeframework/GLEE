"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still close to the value of the product to me. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and focuses on the potential benefit for Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message doesn't immediately close the door to negotiation, making it clear I'm open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $12,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is lower than desired, I still have 9 rounds to try and get closer to my target price.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 gives me leverage to reject Bob's offer without significant risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to keep the negotiation moving.
* **Middle Ground:**  $13,250 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also protects my interests.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,250 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not there yet:**  $13,000 is closer to my minimum, but still below it. 
* **More room for negotiation:** I still have six rounds left, and there's a chance Bob will increase his offer further.
* **John's offer is the safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 allows me to be patient and hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer, I need to be a bit higher to make this worthwhile. Let's aim for $13,500. This price acknowledges your budget while ensuring I get a fair return on this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm increasing my offer by a smaller amount ($500) to show flexibility. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise without giving up too much.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on finding a ""fair return"" and acknowledges Bob's budget.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm staying above my minimum price, keeping the option to walk away and sell to John as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still working with a tight budget, though.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal at $12,800. It's a good price for both of us, and we can move forward without any further delay. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $12,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I still have four rounds left. There's a chance Bob might increase his offer further, especially if he's keen to close the deal.
* **John is a safe option:**  Knowing John is ready to buy at $15,000 provides me with the confidence to reject Bob's offer without taking a big financial hit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,800 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $13,150?  This would ensure a fair deal for both of us and allows us to finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 13150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again proposing a compromise, meeting halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to work towards a solution.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I frame the proposed price as ""fair"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Urgency:** I mention ""finalizing the transaction"" to add a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider accepting the offer."
