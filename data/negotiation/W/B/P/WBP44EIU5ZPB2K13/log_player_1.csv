Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going for the full $12,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could make him walk away.

This strategy balances getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale above Alice's minimum."
