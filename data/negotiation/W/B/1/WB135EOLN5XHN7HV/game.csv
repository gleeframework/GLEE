"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,000? This still leaves you with a good value, and allows me to make a decent profit. Let's try to reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
