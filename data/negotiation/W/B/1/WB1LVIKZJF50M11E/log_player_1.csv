Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts. Here's why:

* **Profit:** You earn $20 more than your minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob still gets a good deal as he saves $20 compared to his perceived value ($120).
* **John's Offer:** If Bob rejects, you have a guaranteed backup buyer at $80, so this offer doesn't leave you with any risk."
