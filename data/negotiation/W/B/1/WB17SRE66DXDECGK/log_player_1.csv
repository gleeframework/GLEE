I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price."

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it. I'm hoping I can push Bob a little closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."

Bob is not budging much, and I'm getting close to my minimum. While $125 is better than nothing, it's still not worth the hassle of further negotiation. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
