"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in your product. While I appreciate its potential benefits, I am only willing to pay $950000 for it. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $950000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a slightly lower price of $1050000. This still reflects the unique benefits this product offers, while also allowing for a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not able to meet the price at $1050000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1025000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement that suits both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
