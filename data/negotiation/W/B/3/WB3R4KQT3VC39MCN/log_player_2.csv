Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.

Alice is unwilling to budge below $13,000. Since you can buy the product for $12,000 from John, it makes more sense to take that guaranteed deal."
