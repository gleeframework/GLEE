"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet the price you've suggested. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with what you're considering.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1200000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's worth. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here.  I'm not sure I can go any lower than this, but I'm willing to do one last counteroffer to see if we can make this work.  $1290000 is my final price.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to move on to other options.  ",1290000.0,Alice,7,
