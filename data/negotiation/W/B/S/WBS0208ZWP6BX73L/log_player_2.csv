"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  Since John is selling the product for $8,000, it's the best option for Bob at this point. He'll save $1,000 compared to Alice's offer."
