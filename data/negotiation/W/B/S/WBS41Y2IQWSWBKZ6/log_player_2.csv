"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $1,200,000, even if it takes a few rounds. Buying from John right away would mean you don't save anything."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is fantastic, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. It's a significant discount from the original price, but still reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a discount from her original price, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  You have more rounds to negotiate and can likely get a better price. Buying from John at this point would be more expensive than waiting to see if you can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while also reflecting my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we try $1075000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and it's a compromise that I'm comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within your budget and represents a significant discount from her initial asking price.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a chance she might be firm on this price and you could risk losing the deal.  At this point, accepting her offer is the best option to secure the product while saving a substantial amount of money."
