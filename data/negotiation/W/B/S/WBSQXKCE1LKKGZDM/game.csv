"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer of $12,000. How about we split the difference and agree on $10,500? Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you.  $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000. That's a significant discount from my initial offer and closer to your budget. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
