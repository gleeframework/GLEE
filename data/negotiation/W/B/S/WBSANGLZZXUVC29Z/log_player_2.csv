"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice values the product at $8,000, so she's likely willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price closer to Alice's desired selling point."
