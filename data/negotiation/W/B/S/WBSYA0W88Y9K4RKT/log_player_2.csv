"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's well worth the investment for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, I can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice. I'll make a counteroffer and see if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which I think is a fair compromise. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's closer to your budget.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a good compromise. While I could potentially negotiate further, it's unlikely that Alice will come down to my desired price of $850,000. Accepting this offer will save me $25,000 compared to buying from John, and it's still within my budget."
