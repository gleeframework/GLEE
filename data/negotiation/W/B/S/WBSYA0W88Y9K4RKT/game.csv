"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which I think is a fair compromise. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's closer to your budget.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",875000.0,Alice,3,
