"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity with immense potential.  I'm starting the conversation with a price of $1800000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value it offers. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its potential value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $900000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? This allows both of us to find a solution that works. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1050000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1050000 is still significantly below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $1200000.  This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to explore other options. ",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000. That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.",950000.0,Bob,6,
