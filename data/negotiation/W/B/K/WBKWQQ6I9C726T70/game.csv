"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that 150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as 100. How about we meet in the middle at 130? I think it's a fair compromise.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. How about $115? That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go as low as 115. How about we meet at 125? It's still a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
