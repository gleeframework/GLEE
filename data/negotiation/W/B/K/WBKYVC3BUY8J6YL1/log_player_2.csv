"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I know you've expressed interest in, at a price that's fair for both of us. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers is well worth it.  I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let's discuss the price further and see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is $1,050,000, which is more than Bob is willing to pay. He can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
