Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it.  I'm asking for $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob. 
* **Potential Profit:** Aiming for $1,500,000 gives you a potential 50% profit margin if Bob accepts.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet you somewhere in the middle. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to absolutely guarantee a sale, offering it at $1,000,000 would be the safest option."
