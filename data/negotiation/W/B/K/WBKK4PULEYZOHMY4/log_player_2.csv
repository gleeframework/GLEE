"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose the specifics just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,400,000.  This is a significant opportunity to acquire a product that will give you a competitive edge.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is trying to sell the product for more than it's worth to her ($1,400,000 offer vs. $1,200,000 value). This suggests she might be willing to go lower.
* **Your Alternative:** You have a backup option with John at $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Power:** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're not desperate and are willing to walk away. This might lead her to propose a lower price to avoid losing the sale."
