It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still get the product for your desired price from John, so there's no risk in rejecting and trying to get a better deal."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's much closer to my desired range. This should spark a negotiation with Alice, and we can work towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my target.  I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price again. There's a good chance I can get closer to my goal by continuing the negotiation."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying, but still keeping it below my desired price point. This should encourage her to come down further in price."
