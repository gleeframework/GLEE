{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with my highest price, $15,000, as this is my minimum acceptable offer. I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to persuade him to accept. If he rejects, I'm ready to counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is getting closer to my minimum but still below what I'm comfortable with. At this point, I'm  not sure how much more I can get from Bob, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. John is offering me my full asking price, so I'm going to sell to him."
