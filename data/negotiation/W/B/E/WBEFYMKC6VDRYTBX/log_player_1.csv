Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be a great asset to your business. My asking price is $950,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This leaves room for negotiation but still gives me a significant profit. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I mention the product being a ""great asset"" to his business, reminding Bob of the value he sees in it.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Earnings:** A starting price close to Bob's perceived value gives me the best chance of getting a high price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  There's enough wiggle room to negotiate down without sacrificing too much. 
* **Keep John as a Safety Net:** The option to sell to John for $800,000 provides a fallback if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting it would leave me with a loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, his interest in the product shows potential for further negotiation.  
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I can use the next round to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain Leverage:** By not accepting a low offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a sale and maintain my negotiating power.
* **Explore a Higher Price:** I can counter with a price that's more favorable to me, potentially reaching a compromise closer to $950,000.
* **Keep the Option to Sell to John:** If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can still sell to John for $800,000."

```

**Explanation:**
