"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  My asking price is $950,000.  This gives you a substantial advantage, and ensures I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested, or we can discuss it further.",950000.0,Alice,1,
