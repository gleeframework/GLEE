Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than what I would get from John. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer in a positive light, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By not stating this is my ""final"" price, I leave the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 threshold I set for myself.  
* **Room for counteroffer:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a backup:**  John provides a safety net, so I'm not pressured to accept a deal that's not beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's still a good deal for a product this great.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Not Too Low:** $105 is still above my minimum price of $100, and closer to my ideal outcome.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product again, hoping to encourage Bob to see the value in my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:** While Bob has moved closer to my price, $92 is still below my minimum.
* **Risk of further haggling:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a protracted process and further price reductions. 
* **John's offer is secure:** John's offer of $100 is guaranteed, giving me the best possible outcome without further negotiation.
* **Time is a factor:** It's always good to secure a deal when you have a solid alternative."
