Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and for valuing the potential of this product.  I've tried to be realistic about its market value, and I need to stay closer to $1,050,000.  I believe that still leaves us some room to negotiate, so I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is my best offer."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $1,075,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm thinking of $950,000. This is my best offer so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but Bob is still significantly under the product's value to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to aim higher to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground here. Let's try to wrap this up quickly. To meet you closer, I can go down to $1,025,000. However, I need you to understand that this is my absolute final offer."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, and I'm thinking of $925,000. This is my best offer so far, and I hope we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's clear that his valuation is anchored far below mine. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk getting even less from Bob in further rounds."
