Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a higher price. However, it's not too high that Bob would instantly reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price point.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
``` 

I'm offering $155, which is still lower than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still trying to get a price closer to what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $145.  While it's still lower than my desired $150, it's very close.  I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation. There's a chance I might not get a higher price, and John is always an option if future negotiations fail."
