Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's a bit lower than what I can accept right now. Given the unique value of this product and the potential it holds for your business, I'm confident a price closer to $1750000 would be mutually beneficial.  It would leave room for us to both walk away satisfied. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1375000 is simply too far below what this product is truly worth.  I'm open to finding a compromise that respects both our positions. How about $1625000? It's a fair price considering the potential benefits this product can offer, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000.
