"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's a bit lower than what I can accept right now. Given the unique value of this product and the potential it holds for your business, I'm confident a price closer to $1750000 would be mutually beneficial.  It would leave room for us to both walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1375000. This is my final offer, and I'd appreciate it if you could consider it.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1375000 is simply too far below what this product is truly worth.  I'm open to finding a compromise that respects both our positions. How about $1625000? It's a fair price considering the potential benefits this product can offer, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1625000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I still think $1625000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1450000. This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
