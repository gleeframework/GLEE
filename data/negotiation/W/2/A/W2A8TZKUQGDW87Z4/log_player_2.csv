Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the value you placed on the product at $1,500,000. If you're still interested, I'm willing to accept $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice has reached her lowest acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal, and John's offer is significantly higher. Accepting $800,000 secures a good price for Bob."
