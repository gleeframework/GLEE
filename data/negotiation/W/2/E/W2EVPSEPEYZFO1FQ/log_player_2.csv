"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your maximum budget and significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or simply proceed to buy from John at a lower cost."
