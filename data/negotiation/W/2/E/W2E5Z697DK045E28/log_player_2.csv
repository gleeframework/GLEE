"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose the specifics without an NDA, I assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm confident you'll find it even more valuable. To make this a mutually beneficial deal, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This price reflects the potential upside you'll gain. Let me know your thoughts.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit, stating the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to her.  Offering $1,500,000 is a big markup.  While the product might be more valuable to Bob, it's better to reject this offer and purchase from John for $1,000,000, saving Bob $500,000."
