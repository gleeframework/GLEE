"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is there any wiggle room in the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a substantial reduction, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the reduction, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hopeful that I can get a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer and try to close the deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. It's a significant discount from my initial price, and it's also above John's offer, so this is my final offer. I believe we can both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $11000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. While I'd like to get more from Bob, his offer of $9,000 is simply too low. With John offering a guaranteed $10,000, it's the best option to secure a decent profit."
