"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your initial offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and would allow us to finalize the deal.
