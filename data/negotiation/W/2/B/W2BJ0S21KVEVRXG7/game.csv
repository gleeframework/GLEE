,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your initial offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is quite a distance from what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and would allow us to finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
