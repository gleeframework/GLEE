Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I know the product's value to Bob ($15,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), I start by offering a price significantly higher than both. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high value without revealing my hand. It aims to pique Bob's interest and make him consider the offer seriously.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm comfortable with this offer because I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000. If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose anything.

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible profit while considering the potential buyer's perspective and the existence of a backup option."
