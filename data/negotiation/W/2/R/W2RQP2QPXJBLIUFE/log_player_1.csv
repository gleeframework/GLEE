Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have room to start high. Aiming for a significantly higher price initially allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  While not revealing your bottom line, the message hints at the product's value to justify the high price without being overly aggressive.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains conversational (""What are your thoughts?"") to encourage Bob to engage in a dialogue and potentially negotiate, rather than outright rejecting the offer.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit:

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts your initial offer, or a price close to it.
* **Worst Case:**  Bob rejects the offer, and you sell to John for your guaranteed $800,000."
