Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows me to potentially earn an extra $1,500.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a strong offer for Bob. It's a significant discount from the public price and still a good deal for me. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is phrased to invite discussion. If Bob counters, I have room to negotiate down to $12,000 and still meet my goal."
