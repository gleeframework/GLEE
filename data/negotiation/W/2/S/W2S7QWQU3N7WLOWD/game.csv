"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1500000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to drop my price to $1800000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let me know if this works for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
