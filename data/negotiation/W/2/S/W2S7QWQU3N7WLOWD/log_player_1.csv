"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. My asking price is $2,000,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm subtly emphasizing the product's value without revealing too much. 

**Strategy:**

This is a high initial offer to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. It's important to be confident but also willing to negotiate if needed.  If Bob rejects, we'll use subsequent rounds to adjust our offer based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the opportunity, but I am only able to pay up to $1500000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's potential to earn more.  I'm not desperate to sell, and rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Gain leverage:**  Rejecting shows I'm not desperate and willing to negotiate further.
* **Gather information:** This gives me valuable insight into Bob's perceived value of the product. 
* **Set the stage for a counteroffer:** By rejecting, I control the next move and can potentially push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will carefully consider Bob's offer and propose a counteroffer that is higher than $1,500,000 but still within a reasonable range.  I will aim for a compromise while maintaining a firm stance on the value of my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,500,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,800,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraint and offer a significant price reduction from my initial $2,000,000.
* **Value Justification:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price compared to Bob's initial offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and cooperative tone to encourage a deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still leaving some room for negotiation.  By reducing my price significantly, I show flexibility and commitment to reaching an agreement.  The goal is to see if Bob is willing to move slightly higher than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I am still unable to meet your previous offer. I would like to propose a price of $1600000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm not desperate to sell and want to see if I can secure a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Gaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer shows I'm not under pressure and willing to negotiate further. 
* **Potential for a Higher Price:** I'm hoping to push Bob closer to $1,700,000 or $1,750,000 in the next round.
* **Information Gathering:** This rejection helps me understand how far Bob is willing to go.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer that is higher than $1,600,000 but still below my initial price. My goal is to find a compromise that both parties find acceptable."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to go down to $1,700,000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value while remaining within your budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round to avoid further negotiation.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's last offer ($1,600,000) and my previous offer ($1,800,000). This shows a clear willingness to compromise. 
* **Urgency:** I suggest we reach an agreement in this round to avoid further negotiation, subtly adding pressure. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I still reiterate the product's value to justify the price. 

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to be a strong compromise while keeping the door open for potential adjustments based on Bob's response.  The goal is to secure a deal as close to $1,750,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your effort in trying to find a middle ground. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a final price of $1650000 for the product. I believe this price reflects both the value of the product and my financial situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is just below my ideal target of $1,700,000.  However, considering:

* **Limited Rounds:**  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation process.  
* **Potential Deal:** Accepting this offer is still a significant profit and above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of Rejection:** Rejecting and making a counteroffer might lead to further rounds of back-and-forth, potentially ending with a lower price or no deal.
* **John's Offer:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, it's only slightly less than Bob's offer.

**Decision:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $1,650,000.  This is a good deal that secures a substantial profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation or losing the sale entirely."
