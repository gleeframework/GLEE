"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can save potentially $1,000 if you can get her down to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my desired selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can still potentially get a better deal from Alice.  While $8,750 is a good price, it's worth seeing if you can push her down just a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,600 for the product. This is a small step down from your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise that we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $8,700. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my desired selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is offering a price that is close to your target. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a chance she'll reject your offer, and you might end up having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting her offer guarantees a good deal for you."
