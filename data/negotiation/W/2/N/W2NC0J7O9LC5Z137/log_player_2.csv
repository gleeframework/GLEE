"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good deal, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  He can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  $110 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $108. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is now within Bob's budget of $120, and it's a better price than what John is offering.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll end up paying $120 to John. It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product for a reasonable price."
