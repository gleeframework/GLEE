"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $999000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $999000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $925000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $850000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, while also giving you a significant amount for your investment.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $850000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $900000. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, and $900000 is getting closer. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to go up to $875000.  This is a very fair price considering our previous discussions and the value I see in the product. Let's try to finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $925000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $885000, which is a good compromise considering our previous discussions. I hope you can see that this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize this deal.",885000.0,Bob,8,
