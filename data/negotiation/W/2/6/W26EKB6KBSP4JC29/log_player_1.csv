Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob above his perceived value ($1,000,000) maximizes Alice's potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob recognizes its true value. Bob gets it for less than Alice's minimum, and Alice earns a significant profit.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" we introduce a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
