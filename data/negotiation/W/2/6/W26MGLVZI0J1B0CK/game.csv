"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $17,000? ",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $17,000, so I'll offer $14,750. Can you consider this price?",14750.0,Bob,4,
