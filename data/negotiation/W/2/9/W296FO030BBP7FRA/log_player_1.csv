Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without risking him rejecting the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $115 is a strong starting point, it leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** It's crucial to stay above your minimum acceptable price ($100) to ensure a profit. 

This offer balances maximizing your potential profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
