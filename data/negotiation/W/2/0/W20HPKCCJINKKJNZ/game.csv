"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your operations, and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, the price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While your offer is tempting, I know how transformative this product can be and  $950,000 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and aim for $987,500.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",987500.0,Bob,4,
