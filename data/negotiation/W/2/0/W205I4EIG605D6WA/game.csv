"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  This is my maximum, considering the value I see in the product. Let me know if you're willing to discuss this.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber.  Its value far exceeds that.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a significant adjustment on my end, reflecting my eagerness to work with you. Let's make this happen.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,900,000 is still outside my financial limitations. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which reflects a significant increase from my initial offer. I hope you'll consider this as a genuine attempt to bridge the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. It demonstrates your serious interest in this product.  To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This offer reflects my desire to close this deal and recognizes the significant value this product holds for you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm still not able to meet that price. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents my final offer. I believe this is a fair price that considers both our interests.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
