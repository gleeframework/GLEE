"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time, I'm willing to move closer to your range. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects my product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000  falls short of what I can accept for the product. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price considering the significant value this product offers. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
