Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000. This means he's unlikely to pay significantly more.
* **The Goal:** You want to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay before he walks away.

**Possible Strategy**

Start high, but leave room for negotiation. This allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he haggles, while still giving you a chance to secure a higher price.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:**  The $950,000 starting price aims to maximize your potential profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" you provide a reason for the high price without explicitly stating it's non-negotiable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower to avoid turning him off completely.
* **Market Conditions:**  If similar products are selling for significantly less than $950,000, you might need to adjust your offer.

**Remember, the goal is to find the sweet spot where Bob feels like he's getting a fair deal while you secure the highest possible price!**"
