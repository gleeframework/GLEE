"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I can't go as low as $12,000 but how about we settle at $14,500? This is my final offer.

You have three options:

While Alice is coming down on price, $14,500 is still significantly higher than John's $8,000 offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge that gap."
