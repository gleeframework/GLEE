"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair deal considering the value it brings.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
