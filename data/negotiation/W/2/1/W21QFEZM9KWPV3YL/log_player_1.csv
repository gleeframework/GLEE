Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
