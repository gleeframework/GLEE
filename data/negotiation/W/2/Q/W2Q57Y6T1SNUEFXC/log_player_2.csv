{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price and save more money.  He has 9 more rounds to try and get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best price possible, so he starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and represents a good starting point for negotiations."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price. While he's getting closer to his goal, Bob should continue negotiating to try and secure a lower price.  He still has 7 rounds left and the potential to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is the same as her initial offer from Round 1. Bob has already rejected this offer twice, and it is likely that she won't lower her price further.  With only 3 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a decent price within his budget.  While he might be able to get a slightly lower price, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal completely."
