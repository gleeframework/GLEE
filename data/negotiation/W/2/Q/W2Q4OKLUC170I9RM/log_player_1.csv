Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's a bit higher than my minimum acceptable value, leaving room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd rather sell to Bob than John, his price is significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is still above my minimum, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  It's also a reasonable middle ground that could potentially entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough to justify selling to Bob over John. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter with $115. This is a further compromise, but still above my minimum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential for further negotiation."
