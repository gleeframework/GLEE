Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you.  My initial price is $1,500,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum goal of $1,000,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by negotiating further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left and believe I can push for a higher price.  I want to try and bridge the gap a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm happy to continue working towards a mutually beneficial deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still only halfway through the negotiation rounds.  I want to keep pushing to see if I can close the deal at a price closer to $1,300,000. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is still an option, but I want to exhaust the negotiation with Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm committed to reaching a deal that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000, which is a significant concession on my part. This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. I believe this is a fair offer and hope you'll accept."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to our last two rounds, and Bob is not budging significantly on his offer. While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum goal.  Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might result in a lower price, I'll take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It's better to secure a known value than risk a lower offer from Bob."
