"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price of $140. Given its value to you, this offer represents a great opportunity to secure it at a reasonable discount. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is a discount, you know you can get the product for $150 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a better price with her or sticking with your backup plan of buying from John."
