"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $900,000 is still significantly more than what the product is worth to Alice ($800,000). There's room for negotiation.
* **Opportunity to save:**  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better deal.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you can always buy from John, ensuring you acquire the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint offer:** This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point, splitting the difference between Alice's offer ($900,000) and Alice's value ($800,000).
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further. If Alice accepts, you save $50,000. If Alice rejects, you can adjust your strategy for the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is worse:** Alice has increased her price from $900,000 to $920,000. This suggests she might be less willing to negotiate than initially thought.
* **Time to push back:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal your determination to get a better price. You still have multiple rounds left to negotiate.
* **John's offer remains a backup:**  You can still buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail.
* **Potential for a lower counteroffer:**  It's possible that Alice will be more open to a lower counteroffer after her initial offer was rejected."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly higher counteroffer:** This counteroffer increases your offer by $25,000 from the previous round. It's still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer ($920,000), but shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **Testing Alice's flexibility:**  This allows you to see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway or if she's still holding firm to a higher price.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  A higher counteroffer could potentially lead to a faster deal, but there's also a risk that Alice might reject it.
* **Staying within your budget:**  $875,000 is still well within your maximum budget of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting worse:** Alice has continued to increase her price, now at $930,000.  This is a clear indication that she's not very motivated to negotiate.
* **More rounds to go:** You still have 5 rounds remaining. It's worth pushing further to try and secure a better deal.
* **John is still a backup:** You can always buy from John if negotiations fail.
* **Potentially pushing Alice to concede:** By rejecting her offer, you might force Alice to reconsider her stance and potentially make a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:** Increasing the offer by a small amount ($5,000) shows that you are willing to negotiate, but also that you are not willing to budge significantly. 
* **Close to Alice's value:**  This offer is still closer to what the product is worth to Alice ($800,000) than it is to Alice's current offer ($930,000).
* **Trying to bridge the gap:** With only 4 rounds left, it's time to see if Alice will be willing to make a concession. If she rejects, you can still adjust your offer in the remaining rounds.
* **John's offer is still a safety net:**  You are still within your budget and have the option to buy from John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is unacceptable:** Alice's offer is now at $950,000, which is getting significantly closer to your budget limit of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited time:** With only 3 rounds left, there's a high risk that Alice will continue to increase her price. 
* **John's offer is the best option:** It's unlikely that you'll be able to negotiate a better price with Alice in the remaining rounds. Buying from John guarantees you the product within your budget.

**It's better to secure the product with John now than risk a potential stalemate or a price that's too close to your limit.**"
