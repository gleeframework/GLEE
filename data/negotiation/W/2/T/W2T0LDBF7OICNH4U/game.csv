"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. This is a one-time offer, so let's see if we can meet in the middle.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $18,000 is still a little bit outside my price range. Would you be willing to go down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer. I could do $13,000.  Would that work for you?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. I can do $13,500, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent discussing it.",13500.0,Alice,7,
