"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $20,000 is quite steep. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $12,000. How about $15,500? This is my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you say that's your final offer, but I'm finding it hard to meet you there.  If you could do $13,000, I think we'd have a deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
