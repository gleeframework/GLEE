Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $20,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $20,000 is quite steep. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $12,000. How about $15,500? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you say that's your final offer, but I'm finding it hard to meet you there.  If you could do $13,000, I think we'd have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to meet my price point. It's better to cut the negotiation short and take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000 than to risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
