Alice's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $625,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $625,000 is a good deal considering your budget. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will not budge further or that you might end up paying more than $625,000 in the end. It's best to accept the offer and secure the product for a price you're comfortable with."
