"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $12,500. It's a fair middle ground, considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. To be honest, $12,500 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12,750. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",12750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am motivated to buy. How about we split the difference and land at $11,875?",11875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the way you think! Splitting the difference is a great way to find a middle ground. However, I'm still a bit short on my desired price. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is just $625 more than your offer. It's a small ask, but I think it's worth it for the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're hitting a wall here. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be mindful of my budget. My final offer is $12,000. If you can't accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $12,200. It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's worth it for the product's value.",12200.0,Alice,9,
