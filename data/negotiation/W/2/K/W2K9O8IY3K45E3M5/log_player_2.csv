Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise again. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I understand this is your final offer, but I'd be much more comfortable with a price closer to $10,000. How about we split the difference one last time and settle on $10,125?"",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go any higher than $10,250. I've already given you a great deal, and I think this is the best price I can offer. If you're not willing to meet me at $10,250, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm at $10,250.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll budge further. Accepting this offer secures a $1,750 savings compared to John's price, which is a significant amount."
