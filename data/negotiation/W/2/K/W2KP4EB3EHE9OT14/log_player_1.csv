Round 4
Bob's offer:

Let's try to push Bob a little further. We're still getting closer to a price that's above our minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  How about we split the difference and settle at $140? It's a fantastic deal for a product of this quality."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $135, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is unlikely to go any higher, and $135 is a reasonable profit above our minimum. It's better to take this deal than risk him walking away and only getting $120 from John."
