"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your offer. To make things more appealing, I'd like to suggest an alternative pricing structure. How about we split the difference between $110 and $95, making the final price $102.50? This way, both parties get a fair deal, and you can enjoy the benefits of our product without straining your budget too much.",102.5,Alice,3,
