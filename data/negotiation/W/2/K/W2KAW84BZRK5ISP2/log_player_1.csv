Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I think it's fairly priced at $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we know John will buy the product for $10,000, that's our absolute minimum. We want to start higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $12,000 allows for Bob to counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle that is still profitable for Alice. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer also helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he flatly refuses or counters with a very low offer, Alice knows she's better off going with John."
