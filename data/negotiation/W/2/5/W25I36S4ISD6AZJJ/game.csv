"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000 for this product.  Given its value to me, I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,100,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work while ensuring a fair value for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. Would you consider $1,075,000?  I believe this price represents a fair compromise that allows us to both close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're driving a hard bargain!  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to stay above $1,090,000 for this to make sense on my end.  How about we settle at $1,095,000 and finally close this deal?",1095000.0,Alice,5,
