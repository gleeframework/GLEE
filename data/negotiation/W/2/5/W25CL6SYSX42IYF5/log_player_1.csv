```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000, but not so high that it seems unreasonable. I'll gauge Bob's interest based on his response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, so I'll reject it. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be a more enticing offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us before I have to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $14,000. This is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I might be forced to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It seems like Bob and I can't agree on a price, and I'm running out of time.  Selling to John for $15,000 is the best option at this point, as it meets my minimum value."
