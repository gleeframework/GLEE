"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $100, but she's asking for $90. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  If you can't get a better deal with Alice, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $87.50. It's a great compromise that I think you'll find worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.** You were willing to pay $85, and she's offering $87.50. This is a fair compromise.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.** While John is a reliable alternative, Alice's offer is significantly cheaper.
* **There's no guarantee you'll get a better deal.** Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it could also lead to a stalemate or Alice withdrawing her offer entirely. 

It's better to accept a slightly higher price than risk losing the product or paying a higher price to John."
