"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $8,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,250. Let's split the difference - how about $9,000? I believe this is a fair price and allows us both to come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $9,250?  I believe this is a fair price that's reasonable for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I've made a concession to $9,500, and you're trying to go back to $9,250. I'm not willing to go back and forth like this. I'll make one final offer: $9,750. This is my absolute final offer, and I expect you to accept it.",9750.0,Alice,7,
