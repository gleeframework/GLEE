Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob values the product at $100, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) allows room for negotiation if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Bob to Counter:**  The offer of $125 is high enough to potentially be profitable for you but also leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding a slight sense of urgency (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to act quicker rather than overthink the offer. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $125. You have a strong alternative with John, so you're not pressured to go below your minimum."
