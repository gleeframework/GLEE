I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $9,750. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping the price above my minimum."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price, especially since I have John as a backup option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly above my minimum, I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting, he might walk away, leaving me with only the $8,000 option from John. It's better to secure a good deal than risk getting a worse one."
