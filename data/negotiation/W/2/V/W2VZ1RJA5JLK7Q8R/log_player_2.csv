"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a better deal.  $12,000 is more than your maximum budget, and you can likely negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still a bit too high, but it's getting closer.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price.  You are close to Jhon's price so if you are unable to close a deal, you can go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit above my budget.  How about $10,200?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 10200}
