Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. It also shows Bob that I'm confident in the value of the product.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I am willing to negotiate, but not at such a drastic price reduction. I will counter with a higher price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum value, but shows a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value and John's offer.  I believe it is in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale. This will allow me to avoid further negotiations and still get a reasonable price."
