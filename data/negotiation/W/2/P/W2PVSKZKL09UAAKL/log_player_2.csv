Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significant, and $650,000 is well below its market worth. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential return on investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While $720,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $850,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer. While she may be bluffing, it's getting too risky. Her price of $850,000 is too close to John's guaranteed price of $800,000. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John to ensure you get the product at a reasonable price."
