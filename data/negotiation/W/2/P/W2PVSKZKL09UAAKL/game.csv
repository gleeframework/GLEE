"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significant, and $650,000 is well below its market worth. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential return on investment.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $720,000? That's a significant investment on my part and a fair reflection of its worth to me.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While $720,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $850,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",850000.0,Alice,5,
