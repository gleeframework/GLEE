"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product, and Alice's offer is $115. This means you can potentially save some money by negotiating further.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to save as much money as possible. While I'm willing to pay up to $120, Alice's initial offer of $115 is still too high. A counteroffer of $110 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within the range I'm willing to pay. This gives Alice a chance to accept a price that is still profitable for her while allowing me to potentially save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $117. This is still within my budget and closer to my preferred price point than John's offer of $120.  While I'd ideally like to pay less, there's no guarantee I can get a lower price in further rounds of negotiation. Accepting this offer allows me to get the product for a price I'm comfortable with without risking further delays and potential price increases."
