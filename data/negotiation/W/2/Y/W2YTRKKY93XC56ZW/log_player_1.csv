Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $800,000 (John's offer)
* **Bob's maximum acceptable price:** $1,200,000
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to capture a larger portion of the surplus value.  This is a reasonable starting point that allows for potential negotiation.  

By offering $1,000,000, I am maximizing my potential profit while still being within Bob's budget. If he rejects the offer, I will sell the product to John for $800,000."
