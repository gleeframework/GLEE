"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit low for me. I can do $10500, and I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if that works for you!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9500? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $9500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $11000, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's meet in the middle!",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your point, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $10250. That's the highest I can go.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10250. I can do $11200, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal!",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm really close to my budget limit. I can do $10800, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider meeting me at this price.",10800.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $10800. I can do $11500, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal!",11500.0,Alice,9,

"I'm really close to my budget limit, and I don't think I can go any higher. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider meeting me at this price.",11000.0,Bob,10,
