"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer of $800,000, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $1,000,000. This is my final offer on the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
