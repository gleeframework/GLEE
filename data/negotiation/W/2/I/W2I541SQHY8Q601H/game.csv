"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's value, I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you agree?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a significant commitment for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
