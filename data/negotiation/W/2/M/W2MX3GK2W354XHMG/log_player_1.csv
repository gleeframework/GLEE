{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point slightly above what Bob is willing to pay, but below your minimum acceptable price. This allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring you make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. You can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? That's a fair compromise, and it still allows you to get a great deal on this fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Even though Bob is getting closer to your minimum price, it's still not enough.  You're better off selling the product to John for $120 and guarantee yourself a profit."
