"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product. This would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
