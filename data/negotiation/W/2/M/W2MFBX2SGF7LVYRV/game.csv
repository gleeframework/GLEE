"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? It's a fair offer, and it allows us to close this deal today.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  While $1,000,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows us to both move forward with this deal. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
