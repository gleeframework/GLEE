"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price, closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging further negotiation.
* **Targeting Value:** My goal is to get the price as close to Alice's perceived value ($100) as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice met me halfway between my initial counteroffer and her original price. 
* **Within Budget:** $105 is within my $120 budget and represents a $15 saving compared to John's offer.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could push Alice away, and there's no guarantee I'd get a better price.  It's better to secure a good deal now."
