# Alice's message: I understand that you're working with a tight budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","It's time to switch tactics.  Alice is clearly comfortable letting this drag on a bit. Let's try this:

```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Alice is very slowly coming down in price.  At this rate, we may only get a small discount.
* **Time Pressure:** We're over halfway through the rounds. By choosing John now, we create a sense of urgency.  Alice might be willing to make a last-minute better offer to avoid losing the sale completely. 
* **Limited Downside:**  The worst-case scenario is that Alice lets us walk and we buy from John at $12,000.  We haven't lost anything by trying this."
