"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000.

"I understand that you're working with a tight budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000, as it's still below its value to you. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,7,
