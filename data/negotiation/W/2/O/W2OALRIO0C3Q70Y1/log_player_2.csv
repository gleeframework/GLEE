"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way over your budget. It's always worth negotiating, especially when you have a backup option like John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move that shows I am serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  I'm aiming for a price that is halfway between my maximum budget and Alice's initial offer. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still being within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still a significant amount of money. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially as I have a backup option with John. I will continue to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is my maximum price point, aligning with John's offer. By offering this price, I'm demonstrating my willingness to buy but also establishing a firm boundary. If Alice rejects this offer, I can confidently move to John without feeling like I've left any money on the table. This strategy puts pressure on Alice to make a decision, and potentially brings us closer to a final deal."
