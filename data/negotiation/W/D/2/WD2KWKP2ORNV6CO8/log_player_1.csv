Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, this gives us room to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price, but I want to see if he's genuinely interested at a premium price first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $1,000,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering the price to $900,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and it shows flexibility while also demonstrating that I'm not willing to sell for Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, $850,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  There's no guarantee that Bob will raise his offer again, and it's likely that continued negotiation will only result in further concessions from both of us.  Selling to John would only net me $800,000, so this deal is the better option."
