"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! $180 is a bit steep for me, though. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product.  Let me know what you think!",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there at $160. How about $155?  I think that's a fair price that's closer to what I'm willing to pay.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $165. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,
