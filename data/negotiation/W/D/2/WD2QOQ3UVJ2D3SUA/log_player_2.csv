Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $12,000.  That's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,000 is still a significant gap from what I need.  To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price, but I'd rather make this work with you. How about $15,500 and we call it a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,500.  I can offer you $14,000. That's the absolute most I can go.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me."", ""product_price"": 14000}
