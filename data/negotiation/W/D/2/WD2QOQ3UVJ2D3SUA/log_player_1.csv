Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $12,000.  That's a good compromise for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,000 is still a significant gap from what I need.  To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price, but I'd rather make this work with you. How about $15,500 and we call it a deal?"", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,500.  I can offer you $14,000. That's the absolute most I can go.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach $15,000. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed offer from John."
