Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

This still leaves you with a substantial profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your initial offer. How about $1,325,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about $1,275,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $1,260,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, we've reached a stalemate.  Bob's offer of $1,260,000 is still too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, I've reached the point where I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob within the remaining rounds.   I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While this is significantly less than what I hoped for, it's still a good deal considering the alternative of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
