"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. Let's try $1,350,000. This still leaves you with a substantial profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your initial offer. How about $1,325,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to stay within your budget. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about $1,275,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to come down to $1,285,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows you to stay within your budget. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1285000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $1,260,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1260000.0,Bob,8,
