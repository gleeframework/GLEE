"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $1,300,000 is a bit above what I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefits it offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product and the benefits it will bring you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  I'm going to stick with my original counteroffer of $1,250,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and my budget.  I believe this is a fair offer that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

I'm willing to meet you halfway again to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1260000.0,Alice,5,
