Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's valuable and could benefit you greatly. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since I know John will buy the product for $100 as a fallback, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.  
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $150 gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. It also establishes a perceived higher value.
* **Open Communication:** The message is crafted to be friendly and encourage dialogue, increasing the chances of a successful sale. 
 
**Important Note:** While I know Bob values the product at $100, I don't want to start at that price.  There's a chance he might value it more than he initially realizes or be willing to pay a premium for immediate availability."
