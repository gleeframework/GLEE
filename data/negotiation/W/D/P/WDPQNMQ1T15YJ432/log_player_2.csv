"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $95. 
* You are willing to pay up to $100 for it.
* You can get the product from John for $100, which is still within your budget.
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to get the product for a lower price from John."
