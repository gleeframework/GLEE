Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $100, starting with a higher offer ($150) gives us room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay slightly more than $100, especially if he perceives the product as valuable. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, we don't lose anything. We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
