Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **My Floor:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000. This sets my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a $200,000 difference between Bob's value and my floor.  Offering $1,150,000 leaves $50,000 for Bob to feel like he got a good deal, while still securing me a significant profit. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still giving Bob a strong incentive to accept."
