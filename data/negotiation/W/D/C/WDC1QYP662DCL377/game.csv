"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $1,200,000 is too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
