{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, there's still room for negotiation. It's likely that Alice is willing to go lower to secure the sale. By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore a lower price point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.  This price is still within the range where Alice might be willing to sell, considering her own valuation of the product."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is a good price for Bob.  It's unlikely he'll be able to get a much lower price with further negotiation. Accepting this offer saves Bob $75,000 compared to buying from John."
