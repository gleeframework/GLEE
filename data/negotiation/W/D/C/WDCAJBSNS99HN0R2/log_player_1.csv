Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After considering the value of the product to him, I'll offer it to him for:

{""product_price"": $950,000}

This is a reasonable starting point, as it's still a significant discount from the product's true value to Bob, but not so low that it's insulting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000, as it's still below the minimum value I'm willing to accept.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to the true value of the product to him. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $925,000}

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's previous offer, but still a bit below the true value of the product to him. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
