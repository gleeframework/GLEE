"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $9,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $7,500? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,000, so I'm counteroffering $8,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
