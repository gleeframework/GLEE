"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$50 is a great price for a product you value at $80, so accepting Alice's offer is the best choice in this scenario."
