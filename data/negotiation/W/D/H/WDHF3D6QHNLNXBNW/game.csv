"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about meeting halfway at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet at $1,250,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer, but I need to stay above $1,250,000. Would you be willing to agree to $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
