Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below what I value the product at. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about meeting halfway at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet at $1,250,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While closer to my desired price, $1,250,000 is still cutting it close. I believe I can get Bob closer to $1,300,000 with a bit more negotiation.  I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer, but I need to stay above $1,250,000. Would you be willing to agree to $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1275000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

This is a tough decision, but Bob has stated it's his final offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,225,000 is still a significant profit margin and better than John's offer. It's time to close the deal."
