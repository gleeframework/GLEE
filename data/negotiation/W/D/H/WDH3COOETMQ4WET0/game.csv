"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Could we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I believe this product is valuable, I can't justify going as high as $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, but I'm afraid we're reaching our limit.  I can offer a final price of $800,000. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the value it holds for me. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
