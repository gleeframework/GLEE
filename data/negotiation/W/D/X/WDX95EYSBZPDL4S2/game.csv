"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to walk away happy. ",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still leaves room for profit for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. I understand your need for a profit, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This price is fair, as it allows me to buy the product within my budget while still giving you a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
