Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, starting high gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer gauges Bob's interest and allows you to adjust your strategy. He might be willing to pay a premium, or his counter-offer could reveal his budget. 
* **John as Leverage:** While not explicitly stated, knowing you have another buyer provides a subtle psychological advantage. You are not desperate to sell, which can strengthen your position."
