Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below his perceived value of the product. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to move down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer in this range."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm going to offer $1,250,000. This feels more in line with the value I'm seeing in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

We're getting closer, but I believe I can still negotiate a better price than $1,250,000. Bob is clearly interested and recognizes the value of the product.  I'm willing to push a bit further in the next round."
