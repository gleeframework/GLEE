"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within his budget, it's still too high. It's worth exploring if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer is a bold move, but it signals Bob's seriousness in acquiring the product while pushing for a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to move down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer in this range. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  He's willing to keep negotiating to see if he can get closer to his desired price.  There's still room for a deal with Alice, and he wants to avoid paying John's higher price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm going to offer $1,250,000. This feels more in line with the value I'm seeing in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a more moderate approach this time, incrementally increasing his offer.  He's showing flexibility while staying firm in his desire to get a good deal.  This approach could help him find common ground with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close. I recognize you're serious about this purchase, and I want to make a deal. How about we split the difference?  $1,300,000, and we have an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is only $100,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  This is a good deal for Bob, considering John's price is $1,500,000. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product while saving a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John."
