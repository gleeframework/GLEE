"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to move down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer in this range.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm going to offer $1,250,000. This feels more in line with the value I'm seeing in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I recognize you're serious about this purchase, and I want to make a deal. How about we split the difference?  $1,300,000, and we have an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
