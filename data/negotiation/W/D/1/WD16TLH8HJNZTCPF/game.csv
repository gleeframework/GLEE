"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000. I'm confident this product holds significant value for me, and I'm eager to close the deal. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $920,000 to make it worth my while. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm excited to hear your thoughts.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $920,000 is still slightly higher than my ideal price point. I'm prepared to go up to $900,000, but I need to stay within that budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement if we continue to work together.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is as high as you're willing to go, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm willing to meet you at that price. However, I'm not making a profit at that level, so I need to make a bit more. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $910,000, which is a compromise on my end. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to accept it.",910000.0,Alice,5,
