"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still below what I can accept. This product is truly unique and will provide a significant return on your investment. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,600,000.  She's stated it's her final offer and emphasized the product's value. While you could continue negotiating, it's highly probable you won't get her below your $1,000,000 limit. John offers a guaranteed way to stay within your budget."
