"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I agree this product is valuable.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $820,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,5,
