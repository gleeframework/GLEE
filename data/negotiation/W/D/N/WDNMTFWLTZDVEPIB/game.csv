"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price reflects the product's value for me and still gives you a healthy profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is truly significant and $950,000 is a fair reflection of that.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. I believe this is a competitive offer that still ensures a win-win for both of us.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $920,000 is still a bit more than I'm ready to pay. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $885,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good deal and me to secure the product within my budget.",885000.0,Bob,4,
