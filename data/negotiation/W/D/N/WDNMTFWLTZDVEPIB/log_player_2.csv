"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $950,000. I'm confident this price reflects its worth and am open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of $800,000.  This means there's room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price reflects the product's value for me and still gives you a healthy profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is truly significant and $950,000 is a fair reflection of that.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. I believe this is a competitive offer that still ensures a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but the offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming to push the price closer to $850,000.  There's still room for compromise, and rejecting the offer keeps Bob in a strong position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $920,000 is still a bit more than I'm ready to pay. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $885,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good deal and me to secure the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 885000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I aim for a mutually beneficial deal, I must emphasize the true value of this product.  Let's settle at $900,000. This offer recognizes its worth while offering you a reasonable entry point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, but Bob is still aiming to get a lower price.  While $900,000 is better than the previous offer, Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He still has several rounds left, and there's a good chance he can get the price closer to his target."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $890,000. This price is fair and represents a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}
