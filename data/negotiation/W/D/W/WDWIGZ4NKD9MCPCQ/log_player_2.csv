"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save $3,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  It's likely Alice will accept a counteroffer closer to her $8,000 value than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's $12,000 offer, but still above Alice's value of $8,000.  This gives Alice room to negotiate while still giving Bob a substantial saving.  It's a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial $12,000, it's still $3,000 higher than Bob's desired price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still $1,000 below Alice's latest offer and leaves room for further negotiation. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward without immediately going to John for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is now just $500 above Bob's last counteroffer and only $2,500 above his desired price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal, and it's likely that further negotiation will be time-consuming.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most efficient way to acquire the product while still achieving a good price."
