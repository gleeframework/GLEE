"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential price ceiling. 
* **Anchoring:**  The initial price serves as an anchor. While high, it sets the stage and may influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""immense value and potential,"" the message aims to justify the high asking price, even though it's significantly more than Bob's perceived value. 

**Important Note:**  Alice has a strong fallback option with John. This allows her to negotiate from a position of strength and be less concerned about losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. My proposed price for the product is $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase, it's still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Alice has room to negotiate further and try to close the gap. She'll reject this offer and prepare a counteroffer for Round 3."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your proposed price, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher figure. I'm willing to move down to $2,100,000. This offer represents a significant concession on my part and underscores my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** Alice is making a concession by decreasing her price, demonstrating flexibility. However, the decrease is relatively small, maintaining a firm stance and signaling the product's value.
* **Justification:**  The message re-emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price, even with the reduction.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** Alice's counteroffer aims to move the negotiation toward a potential compromise within a range where both parties might find acceptable ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I must stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is now above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While Alice could potentially negotiate for more, accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
