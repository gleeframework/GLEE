"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $10000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price. You can likely negotiate a better deal. By rejecting the offer, you can try to push the price down closer to your desired range or even Alice's own valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's price, but it's still above her own valuation.  It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiation and shows that you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $8500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I can likely negotiate a better price by rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer. This will show that I'm serious about getting a good deal and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a little hesitant at $9,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to meet halfway.  $8,750 is still above Alice's valuation but below her last offer, making it a potentially attractive deal for both parties.  It also sets the stage for a possible final agreement."
