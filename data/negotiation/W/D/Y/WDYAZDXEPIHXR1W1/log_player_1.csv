{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also friendly and encourages Bob to respond.  We're aiming for a good compromise while still maximizing our profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  We can do better by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $8500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a little hesitant at $9000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is above our minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While we could try to push for a higher price, it's unlikely Bob will budge further.  It's best to secure this deal and avoid further negotiation."
