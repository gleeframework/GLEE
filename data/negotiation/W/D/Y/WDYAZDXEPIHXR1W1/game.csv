"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $8500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a little hesitant at $9000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",8750.0,Bob,4,
