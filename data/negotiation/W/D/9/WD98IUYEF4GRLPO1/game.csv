"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $105. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and settle on $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it hard to resist.",100.0,Bob,4,
