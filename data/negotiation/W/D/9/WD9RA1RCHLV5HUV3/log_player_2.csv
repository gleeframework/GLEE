"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but we can still try to negotiate a bit further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $7,000 might have been a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

We are now aiming directly at Alice's perceived value of the product. This is a strong offer that is still beneficial for me, but it might be the most Alice is willing to accept."
