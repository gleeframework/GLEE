"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth more than $80 to me. Considering its quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $100 for it. Would you be interested in discussing this offer further?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $100 to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90, which is the highest I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to accept this price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your perspective, I must respectfully decline as we need to cover our costs and ensure profitability. I am willing to consider a price of $95 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $92, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm glad you're interested in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to lower the price to $93. This allows us to maintain a fair profit margin while staying competitive in the market. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.",93.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $93 is the best value for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $90, which is the lowest price I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. After evaluating the situation, I'm willing to agree on a price of $91 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our positions, ensuring that both parties are satisfied. I believe this is the best outcome for us considering the value of the product.",91.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $91 is the best value for me. I'd like to reiterate that I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement, and I'm considering other options. Can you meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,8,
