"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but it's still higher than what the product is worth to you. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer starts with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still higher than the product's worth to her, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the lower offer, appealing to both the value of the product and your budget.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Alice to continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  Alice's offer is a compromise and represents a significant drop from her initial offer. 
* **Good Value:** While you could potentially negotiate further, $875,000 is a price that provides good value for you, especially compared to John's $1,000,000 offer. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice becoming unwilling to sell at all, leaving you with the less favorable option of buying from John."
