"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is still significantly more than the product's worth to Alice.  It's worth negotiating further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  Considering the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the market value and the benefits you'll gain from owning this product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while allowing us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further compromise, but it still leaves some room for Alice to make a concession.  It's a reasonable price that should encourage Alice to consider accepting."

Round 5

Round 6

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you at $1,087,500. I believe the product's value to you is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  You've already made several concessions, and there's a real risk of going back and forth for several more rounds without reaching an agreement.  At this point, buying from John for $1,500,000 becomes the more logical choice. While it's not your ideal price, it guarantees you get the product and avoids the potential for a drawn-out negotiation."
