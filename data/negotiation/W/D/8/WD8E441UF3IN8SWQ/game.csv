"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm really interested in your product, but I'm still not quite there on the price.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
