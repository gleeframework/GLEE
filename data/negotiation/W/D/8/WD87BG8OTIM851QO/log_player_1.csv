"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $15,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the negotiation game.  If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his perceived value and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction from my initial offer. I'm going to reject his counteroffer and see if I can get him to come up a bit.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm offering $17,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a significant profit for me.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and will be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While $12,000 is closer to my minimum than his initial offer, it's still not a price I'm happy with. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge further. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I still have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $16,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm still holding out for a price that's more profitable than selling to John. I'm hoping that Bob is close to his maximum price and will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal. John's offer is only $1,000 more, and I have several rounds left to try and get Bob to come up just a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to offer $14,500. It's a small increase over Bob's last offer, but it's the best I can do. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm serious about closing a deal and will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiation has stalled. Bob seems unwilling to budge, and even though his last offer is just $2,000 below my minimum, I'm not confident I can get him to agree to a higher price in the next round.  I'm going to sell the product to John. It's not the ideal outcome, but it's better than risking another rejection and having to accept Bob's final offer."
