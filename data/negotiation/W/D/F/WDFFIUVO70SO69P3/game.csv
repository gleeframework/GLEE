"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a great price.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $825,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested.",800000.0,Alice,5,
