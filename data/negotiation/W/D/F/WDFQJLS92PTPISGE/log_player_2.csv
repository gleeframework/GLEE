"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he can get the product from John for $10,000.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's worth to me, I can offer you $9,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better offer than before,  $10,500 is still more than he wants to pay. He can get the product from John for $10,000. It's better to keep trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet at $10,000? This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and it aligns with the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the previous offer. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'll offer you $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice has shown that she's unwilling to go down to $10,000, and Bob is likely to keep getting counteroffers at or above that price.  It's better to just buy from John at $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
