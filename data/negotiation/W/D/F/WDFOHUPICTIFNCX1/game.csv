"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. While I value it at $15,000, I'm not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This would still be a good deal for you, as you value it at $10,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000.  This represents a significant savings for me, while still allowing you to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to compromise further.
