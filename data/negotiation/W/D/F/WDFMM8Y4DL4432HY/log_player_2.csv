"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'll sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
We're aiming to spend less than $100, and Alice's first offer is higher. We have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get her to come down on the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a price below our $100 limit.
* **Polite and Interested:**  We're maintaining a polite and interested tone to encourage continued negotiation. 
* **Strategic Goal:**  Our ideal outcome is to get Alice closer to $90-$95. By starting low, we increase the chances of landing within that range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not quite:** Alice is getting closer to our desired price range, but we're still aiming to save as much as possible.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate, especially since we have several rounds left. 
* **Slight Risk:** We're taking a slight risk that Alice might not go much lower, but the potential savings are worth it at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $95 is getting closer, but I was hoping to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Fair:** We're proposing a specific price that represents a compromise (""meeting in the middle"").  
* **Respectful but Firm:** We acknowledge Alice's movement but reiterate our desire for a lower price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $90 is our target price. If Alice accepts, we've achieved a great deal. If she rejects it, we have a few more rounds to potentially negotiate or consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'll sell the product to you for $97.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Savings Potential:** While $97.50 is not our ideal price, further haggling is unlikely to yield significant savings.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $97, and we'd only save $2.50 by going with John.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Continuing to push Alice might lead to her hardening her position or us running out of rounds. 
* **Good Overall Deal:**  $97.50 is still a decent price, saving us $22.50 compared to Alice's initial offer."
