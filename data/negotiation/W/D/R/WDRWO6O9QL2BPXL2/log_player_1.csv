"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

1. **Start High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
2. **Justification:** By highlighting the ""immense potential,"" I aim to frame the product's value beyond Bob's current understanding, potentially shifting his perception.
3. **Open to Negotiation:**  The language ""initially proposing"" and ""starting point"" signals my flexibility and openness to negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the door open for a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his initial perception, it's still considerably lower than my target price.  I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to go lower, but not this early in the negotiation. By rejecting, I signal that I'm seeking a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  I'm willing to move closer to your price, but $1,800,000 is still significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet halfway at $2,050,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

1. **Show Flexibility:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and willingness to negotiate, signaling I'm flexible.
2. **Strategic Compromise:** By proposing $2,050,000 (exactly halfway), I demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still anchoring the negotiation above $2,000,000.
3. **Reiterate Value:** I subtly reinforce the product's high value to counterbalance Bob's lower offer and justify my price point.

The goal is to find a price point that is acceptable to both parties while maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and staying within my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to the $2,000,000 mark, which is a positive sign. However, the gap between his offer and my minimum price is still significant. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation. I'm not ready to accept $1,950,000 yet, and selling to John for $1,500,000 would be a significant loss at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my part."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

1. **Show Respect and Understanding:** I acknowledge Bob's seriousness and effort in the negotiation.
2. **Final Offer Tactic:**  By stating ""$2,000,000 is my final offer,"" I create a sense of urgency and emphasize that I'm at my limit. 
3. **Justification:** Highlighting the ""significant compromise"" reminds Bob of the initial price gap and frames this offer as a valuable concession.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely. If he rejects this, I'm prepared to walk away and accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I stated $2,000,000 was my ""final offer,"" Bob's counter of $1,900,000 is strategically a good place to accept. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and represents a substantial profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for more risks Bob walking away. The difference of $100,000 is not worth jeopardizing the deal at this stage. 
* **Negotiation Pattern:** Bob has consistently increased his offers in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll drastically increase from this point.

Accepting at $1,900,000 secures a very good deal and avoids the potential loss of walking away with nothing."
