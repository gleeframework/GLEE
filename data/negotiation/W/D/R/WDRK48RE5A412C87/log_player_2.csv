You can do better than $120. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $100. There's room for negotiation!"

Alice is getting closer to your price range, but there's still some room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price before giving up."

Alice has come down to $126, which is a good deal considering your maximum budget is $150. It's worth accepting this offer as you're likely to save more money than if you continue negotiating or buy from John."
