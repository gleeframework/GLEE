# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. I believe it holds significant value that could greatly benefit you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Buying from Alice for $12,000 saves Bob $3,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Although Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($8,000), it's still a good deal for Bob, who values it at $15,000."
