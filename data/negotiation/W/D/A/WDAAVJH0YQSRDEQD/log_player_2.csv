Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is far too low for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,175,000. This reflects the value we both see in this product and allows for a fair deal. I believe this is a good starting point for our continued negotiations.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down further to $950,000.
