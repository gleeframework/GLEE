"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I know it's a valuable asset to you, and I'm confident you'll see the potential in it. Let's make this happen!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that's a high starting price. I see value in the product, but $1,750,000 is not feasible for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 to start the negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is far too low for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,175,000. This reflects the value we both see in this product and allows for a fair deal. I believe this is a good starting point for our continued negotiations.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  However, $1,175,000 is still too high for my budget. I can offer $700,000. I think this price reflects a willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the value of your product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down further to $950,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle on $800,000?  That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal considering the current market and the value it presents to me. ",800000.0,Bob,6,
