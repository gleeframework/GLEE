"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I know it's a valuable asset to you, and I'm confident you'll see the potential in it. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below my minimum ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value for both of us, encouraging a win-win scenario.
* **Confidence:**  I'm confident in my product's value, and my message reflects that, hopefully encouraging Bob to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a high starting price. I see value in the product, but $1,750,000 is not feasible for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 to start the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he acknowledges the product's value and is willing to negotiate. There's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I have 9 more rounds to explore options and potentially get closer to my desired price. Selling to John immediately would be a guaranteed $1,500,000, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is far too low for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,175,000. This reflects the value we both see in this product and allows for a fair deal. I believe this is a good starting point for our continued negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize the shared value of the product and frame this as a fair starting point for future negotiations.
* **Reasonable Counter:** My counteroffer is within a range that shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my desired profit margin. 
* **Clear Communication:** My message is clear and direct, leaving no room for misinterpretation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  However, $1,175,000 is still too high for my budget. I can offer $700,000. I think this price reflects a willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, $700,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation continues:**  I have 6 more rounds to reach a more favorable price.
* **Potential for higher offer:** By continuing the negotiation, I can explore options and potentially get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:** I'll propose a counteroffer closer to my desired price but still within a range that shows a willingness to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down further to $950,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Concession:**  I'm reducing my price further, demonstrating my flexibility while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Focus on Shared Needs:** I emphasize finding common ground and a fair deal that benefits both of us. 
* **Strong Closing:**  My message is assertive and conveys a sense of finality, encouraging Bob to seriously consider the offer.

**Strategy:** 

By continuing to negotiate and making small but significant concessions, I'm hoping to push Bob closer to my desired price while maintaining a positive and collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle on $800,000?  That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal considering the current market and the value it presents to me.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Even though Bob is offering his ""final offer,"" it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Time is running out:** We're now in round 6, and we have only 4 rounds left. Continuing the negotiation might lead to a stalemate, wasting valuable time.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.

**Conclusion:** While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, it's not worth risking further negotiation when I have a guaranteed and more profitable offer from John."
