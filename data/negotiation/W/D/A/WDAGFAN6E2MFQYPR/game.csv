"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiations.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $850000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm afraid $850000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being a fair compromise for me.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Let me think about it for a moment. I would like to propose a price of $900000. This is still below your initial offer, but I believe it is a fair compromise given my valuation of the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not convinced that $900000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'm thinking more along the lines of $975000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've considered your latest proposal, Alice. While I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, I would like to stick closer to my original valuation. I am willing to pay $925000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $925000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1000000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $975000 is too low, so I'll meet you in the middle at $950000. Let's see if we can get a deal done.",975000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, thank you for your patience and willingness to negotiate. I've carefully considered your last proposal, and I believe we can reach a fair agreement. I am willing to pay $950000 for the product. I hope this offer will help us close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to accept $950000. I'm at my limit for concessions, and I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to make a firm offer of $1000000, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
