"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $150 is my absolute minimum. This product is worth more than that, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable investment. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $135. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $142.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $142.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget of $80. I'll offer $130. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",130.0,Bob,6,
