This offer is a good starting point as it is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a clear expectation of the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
