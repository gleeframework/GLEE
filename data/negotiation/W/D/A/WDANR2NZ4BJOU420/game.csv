"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm a savvy buyer, and I've done my research. I believe this product is worth a lot to me, but I'm not willing to pay top dollar. Can you meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're a savvy buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your research. However, I have to say that $8000 is a bit low for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to counteroffer at $10500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $10500 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $9000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
