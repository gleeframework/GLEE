Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $14,000 for it. I think it's a fair price considering its worth and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand where you're coming from, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
