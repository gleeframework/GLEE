"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,500,000 is still too high for my budget. I can offer you $900,000.  I feel this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're both serious about getting this deal done. I'm ready to be very direct to find a solution that works for us both.  I'm willing to drop my price significantly to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while offering you a very fair deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to be direct.  To be equally transparent, my absolute maximum is $1,000,000 for this product.  I can offer you $950,000 as a final attempt to meet somewhere in the middle.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
