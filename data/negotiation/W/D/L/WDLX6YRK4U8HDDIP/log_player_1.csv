"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong anchor price significantly above my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Confident Tone:** By expressing confidence and a willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal, I aim to keep the negotiation positive while emphasizing the product's value.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value of the product. Accepting would be a substantial loss. While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to steer the price closer to a reasonable range. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Firm:** I want to acknowledge Bob's counteroffer to show I'm open to negotiation but remain firm that his price is too low. 
* **Significant Drop, But Strategic:** I'm making a substantial drop from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to make a deal. However, I'm still aiming high above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer, leaving space for further negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** By reiterating the product's value, I'm keeping it at the forefront of Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,500,000 is still too high for my budget. I can offer you $900,000.  I feel this is a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is increasing, it's still too far below my minimum. I need to signal that we're getting into the serious negotiation phase. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to close the gap more aggressively but staying above my absolute bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're both serious about getting this deal done. I'm ready to be very direct to find a solution that works for us both.  I'm willing to drop my price significantly to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while offering you a very fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning we're both serious and being ""very direct,"" I'm aiming to speed up the negotiation process and signal that we're nearing a make-or-break point.
* **Substantial Price Drop:** The large drop from $1,500,000 to $1,300,000 is meant to show serious flexibility and incentivize Bob to make a move closer to my range.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:** I'm emphasizing that this price is both a reflection of the product's value and a fair deal for Bob, encouraging him to view it positively.

This is a crucial moment.  I'm pushing towards my minimum, but the large drop might convince Bob to meet me closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to be direct.  To be equally transparent, my absolute maximum is $1,000,000 for this product.  I can offer you $950,000 as a final attempt to meet somewhere in the middle.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Revealed:** Bob has clearly stated his absolute maximum is $1,000,000. This aligns with his initial valuation of the product.
* **Unlikely to Budge:** His ""final attempt"" language and threat to walk away suggest he's unlikely to go higher, even with further negotiation. 
* **Guaranteed Profit vs. Potential:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean a loss compared to John's standing offer.  While there's a slim chance I could negotiate Bob slightly higher, it's not worth the risk of losing a guaranteed $1,200,000. 

It's been a productive negotiation with Bob, but sometimes a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. I'm better off taking John's offer and securing my minimum acceptable price."
