# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $115.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

You can do better than $115.  You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before buying from John."

You're still closer to your goal of $100 than Alice is to her goal of $110.  Continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price."
