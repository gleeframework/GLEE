"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

You're looking to save as much as possible, and $9,500 is still a bit more than you want to spend. You can counteroffer Alice and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500?  I know it's close to your value, but it's the best I can do at the moment."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That way, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is within your budget and is a better price than what John is offering. You're willing to pay a little extra to secure the product rather than risk losing it to another buyer."
