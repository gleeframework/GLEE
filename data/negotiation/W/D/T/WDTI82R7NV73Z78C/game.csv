"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that price point is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to move closer to your number. How about we meet halfway and settle on $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $825,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $760,000? It's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're driving a hard bargain! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm prepared to come down slightly to $800,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  This is my final offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
