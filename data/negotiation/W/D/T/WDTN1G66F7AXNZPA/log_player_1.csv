Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. While I have other interested buyers lined up, I believe this would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but still offer an incentive for Bob to buy. 
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit adds urgency to Bob's decision-making.
* **Alternative Buyer:** By mentioning other buyers, Alice reinforces the value of the product and the risk of missing out to Bob.

**Why not higher?:**

While Alice could try for a higher price, going too close to $1,200,000 eliminates the incentive for Bob to buy *now* instead of letting Alice go to John.  There needs to be a win-win situation for a deal to happen."
