"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it and it will be a great value for you. Would you like to purchase it from me for $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $9,000 is under your $10,000 limit, you can do better.  You know John is willing to sell it for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for her to potentially offer a lower price, closer to her $8,000 value."
