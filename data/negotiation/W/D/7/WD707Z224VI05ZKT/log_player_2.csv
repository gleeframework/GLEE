"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of our product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a better price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget for it is $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is your budget for the product, but I have to consider my own costs and profits. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still not within it.  Since I know I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's more beneficial to end negotiations with Alice and buy from John.  I've saved $100,000 by choosing John."
