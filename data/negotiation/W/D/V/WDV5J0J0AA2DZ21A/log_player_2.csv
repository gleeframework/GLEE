"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you that I believe will be of significant value to your business. I'm offering you the chance to acquire [Product Name] for a price that reflects its potential.  While I understand its worth to you is significantly higher, I'm willing to offer it at a price that's still very attractive.  I'm confident you'll find this to be a compelling proposition.  Let's discuss further.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $1,200,000 is significantly less than $1,500,000.
* **You still save money:** Even at $1,200,000, you're getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000."
