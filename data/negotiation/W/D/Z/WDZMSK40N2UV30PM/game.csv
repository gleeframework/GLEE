"Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that 80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for 110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $90 for it, and I think that's fair considering my original offer.  Let's make a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that 90 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for 100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $100 is still a bit out of my budget. If you can come down to $95, I'll take it off your hands.  It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that 95 is getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you the product for 105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",105.0,Alice,7,
