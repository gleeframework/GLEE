Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is in high demand, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $14,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $13,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good deal. It surpasses my minimum acceptable price by $3,000 and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or losing Bob as a buyer entirely."
