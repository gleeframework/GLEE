"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $175 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $150?  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
