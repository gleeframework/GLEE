"Round 1

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $18,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  He can still get the product from John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Alice fails."

Round 3
