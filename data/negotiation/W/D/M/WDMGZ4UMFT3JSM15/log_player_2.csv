"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10800. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has come down in price, $10,800 is still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth rejecting and seeing if Alice will go lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While there's a chance Alice might come down further, it's not guaranteed, and continuing to negotiate risks exceeding Bob's budget. 

At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids the risk of a drawn-out negotiation that might not result in a favorable price."
