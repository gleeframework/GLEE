Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it still allows for some wiggle room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by highlighting the value of the product and framing it as a good deal for him.  I'll be ready to adjust my price if needed, but I'm not willing to go below $100, as that's my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I could accept $85, it's better to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my goal. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to keep the negotiations going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm not thrilled about selling to John for $100, Bob is stubbornly sticking to his offer of $85.  This is not acceptable, as it's below my minimum.  It's time to move on and take the guaranteed $100 from John."
