"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount, given the product's value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  

It's important to remember that Bob can always buy from John for $1,000,000, so this strategy carries no risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate. 
* **Midpoint Approach:**  It's close to the midpoint between Bob's maximum budget and Alice's initial offer. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair"" price, potentially appealing to Alice's sense of reason and willingness to compromise.

**Strategy:**

* **Test the Waters:**  This counteroffer gauges Alice's willingness to negotiate further. If she rejects it, Bob can adjust his strategy accordingly. 
* **Keep Options Open:**  Bob still has the option of buying from John, which allows him to be more aggressive in his negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,050,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Budget:**  $1,080,000 is only $80,000 over Bob's maximum budget, a relatively small difference.
* **Alice's Finality:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, making further negotiation risky. 
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** Even if Bob rejects, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. She might simply end the negotiation.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  By rejecting and risking a stalemate, Bob might miss out on the product and be forced to buy from John at a potentially higher price.

**Strategy:**

This decision is a calculated risk. Bob is sacrificing some savings to secure the product, but the chance of a better deal is low, and the risk of losing the deal is high."
