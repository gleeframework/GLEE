"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about a compromise? I'm willing to drop the price to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
