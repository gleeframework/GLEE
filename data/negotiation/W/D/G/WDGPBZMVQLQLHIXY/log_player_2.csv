The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $22,000. It's too high, so Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 reflects the true value, I'm willing to come down to $20,000. This offer stands as a compromise and reflects the value you'll gain from it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
