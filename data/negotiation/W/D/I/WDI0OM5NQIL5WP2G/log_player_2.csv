# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll go for $11,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $11,250 is still a bit higher than what I'm able to pay right now.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

```

Alice's offer of $11,200 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000.  He's getting a better deal and it saves him more time."
