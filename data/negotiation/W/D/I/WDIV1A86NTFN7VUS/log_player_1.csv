"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can offer you $120 for the product. I hope this price works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're showing interest. While I understand your perspective, $120 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still get great value out of the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
