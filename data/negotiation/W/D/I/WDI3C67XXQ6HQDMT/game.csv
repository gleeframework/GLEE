"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer.",18000.0,Alice,3,
