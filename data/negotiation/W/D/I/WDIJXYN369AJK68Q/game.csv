,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $75?  I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $85 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. How about $82?  It's a fair price and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",82.0,Bob,4,
