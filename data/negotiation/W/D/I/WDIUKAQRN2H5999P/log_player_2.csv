(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still above your target of saving as much as possible.  You have room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a better deal.  You can counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point.  It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This shows that you are serious about buying the product but are also willing to negotiate.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate, but also incentivizes her to accept your offer to avoid losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your target price. While it's closer to your desired price than her initial offer, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You can make another counteroffer and see if you can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your previous offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet Alice halfway. It's still lower than Alice's current offer, giving her some room to negotiate while still achieving your goal of saving money. This move allows you to test Alice's willingness to concede and get closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, she's clearly holding firm to a price that's still too high for you. You've already made multiple counteroffers, and it seems unlikely that you'll be able to get the price down to your target range. At this point, buying from John for $1,000,000, while not ideal, is the most sensible option. It ensures you get the product and avoids potentially endless negotiation with Alice."
