"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high for Bob's budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $800,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. This starts the negotiation process and allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise. It's a reasonable starting point while still leaving room for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is the same price as John's offer. There's no benefit to continuing negotiation, so Bob should accept Alice's offer and secure the product at the lowest possible price."
