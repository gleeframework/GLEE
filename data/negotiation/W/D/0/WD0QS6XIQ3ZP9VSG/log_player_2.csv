You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Alice values the product at $800,000, so there's potential for a better deal.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He's offering $850,000, which is still a good profit for Alice considering her valuation of $800,000. This counteroffer signals Bob's serious interest while also leaving room for further negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer and closer to her initial asking price. However, Bob is still hoping to get a better price, and there are more rounds left to negotiate.  There's still a possibility that Alice may budge further. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $945,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $945,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price point.  While he could continue negotiating, time is running out. With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice and having to buy from John at $1,000,000 is high.  Accepting this offer secures a deal that is within Bob's budget and a good compromise."
