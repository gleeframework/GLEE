"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for a price below its true value to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay the full $1,200,000. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency and make you think you're getting a special deal. However, you know John will sell it for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a better price or proceed with your backup plan and buy from John."
