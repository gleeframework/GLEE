"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for your product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a strong starting point for a successful transaction. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1250000 is a bit too low for me. I'm open to meeting in the middle. How about $1350000? This price still offers you a good deal while ensuring I get a fair value for my product. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of your product while staying within my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1300000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $1325000 as a final offer. It's a fair compromise that ensures both of us get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
