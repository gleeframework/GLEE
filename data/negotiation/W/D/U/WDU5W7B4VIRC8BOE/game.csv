"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value.  I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. Can you meet me in the middle and consider a price of $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full value.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. Can you consider a price of $975,000? I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm prepared to accept $1,000,000 for the product, which is my absolute minimum. This price reflects the product's true value and allows us both to come away satisfied. I hope you'll accept this final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
