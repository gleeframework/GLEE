{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value.  I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly more than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. Can you meet me in the middle and consider a price of $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can secure a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full value.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and express my willingness to negotiate further. 
* **$1,025,000:**  This offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counter-offer. It still allows me to get a decent profit while potentially securing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. Can you consider a price of $975,000? I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell below that point.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can find common ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm prepared to accept $1,000,000 for the product, which is my absolute minimum. This price reflects the product's true value and allows us both to come away satisfied. I hope you'll accept this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's efforts, reaffirm my minimum price, and emphasize that this is my final offer. 
* **$1,000,000:** This is my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.  

This offer is a calculated risk. I'm hoping that Bob, seeing my determination and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement, will accept. If he rejects, I'll proceed with the sale to John."
