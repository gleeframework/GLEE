{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth your consideration. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial offer:** Starting at $10,000 is a good compromise. It's more than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to make a profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By offering a price that is not my absolute minimum, I can potentially negotiate higher if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Alternative buyer:** I'm keeping the option of selling to John for $12,000 in mind, which gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  $9,000 is still below my minimum of $12,000, so I'm not willing to accept it yet.
* **Potential for higher negotiation:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. He's already shown interest and is willing to negotiate.
* **Keeping the option open:** By rejecting his offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to my target.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $9,000 but lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? It's still a great price for a product like this. "", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer ($9,000), but still lower than my initial offer ($10,000). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **""Meeting in the middle"" framing:**  Using this language makes it seem like a fair and balanced offer.
* **Still profitable:**  $9,500 is above my minimum of $12,000, so I'd still be making a profit, albeit smaller than my initial goal. 
* **Staying open to further negotiation:**  The price is still slightly below my ideal, which leaves room for more negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  While $9,200 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I want to maximize my profit.
* **Potential for a better offer:**  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and he's getting closer to my desired price point. 
* **John's offer:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $12,000, which is my target price. This gives me strong leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

**Next Step:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $9,200, but still lower than my initial offer of $9,500. I want to see if I can reach a price closer to my minimum before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I really appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,300 seems fair, given the value of this product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 9300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** This offer is slightly higher than Bob's offer of $9,200 but still lower than my previous offer of $9,500.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage a positive response.
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm using language like ""finalize this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and motivate Bob to accept.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $9,300 is still above my minimum of $12,000, ensuring I'm still making a profit.
* **John's offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup, but I'm hoping to secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to make sure I'm staying within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  $9,000 is my minimum price, and I'm hesitant to go any lower. While it's great to get a deal, I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and Bob is clearly unwilling to move much further.
* **John's offer:**  At this point, I'm better off taking the guaranteed $12,000 from John.  It's a significant increase over Bob's offer and achieves my goal of selling the product for at least my minimum.
* **Time and energy:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag on, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get him to budge. John's offer provides a quick and easy solution.

**Final Thoughts:**  While I would have loved to get closer to my initial target price, I'm happy to secure a profitable deal with John. It's important to recognize when a negotiation has reached its limit and move on to a better opportunity."
