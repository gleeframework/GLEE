Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Confident Tone:** I'm presenting the offer with confidence, hoping to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly implies that I'm willing to discuss the price further.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely watch Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation.  
* If he's too far below my minimum, I'll move to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price for the product ($12,000). 
* **No Room for Improvement:** There's no guarantee that I can get a better price from Bob by rejecting his offer and counter-offering.
* **Time is Money:**  Delaying could mean losing Bob as a buyer, and I'd have to rely on John, who might not be as immediate a sale. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice given the current situation."
