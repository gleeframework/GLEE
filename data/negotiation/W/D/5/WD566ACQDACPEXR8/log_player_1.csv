{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's work something out."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **The message is friendly and encourages negotiation:** It sets a positive tone and emphasizes mutual benefit. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below where I'd like to be. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to purchase the product at a price you're comfortable with and me to get a fair price for my investment.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$920,000 is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm going to counteroffer again, as I believe I can push for a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $920,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer the product for $935,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal you'll be happy with. Let's finalize this transaction and move forward."", ""product_price"": 935000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $915,000. That's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, Bob's counteroffers are still too low. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not sure I can get a much better price from Bob. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and saves me further negotiation time."
