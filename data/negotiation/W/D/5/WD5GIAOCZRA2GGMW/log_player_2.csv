While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still a good starting point.  There's room for negotiation, and we have 10 rounds to try and get a better price.  Rejecting allows us to make a counteroffer and see if we can get closer to our desired price point."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price point that's more appealing to me. This will likely be rejected, but it establishes my desire for a lower price and sets the stage for further negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 710000}

I'm making a smaller counteroffer this time, aiming to gradually close the gap and find a price that's acceptable to both of us. By moving closer to Alice's previous offer, I signal my willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, I believe we can still negotiate a better price.

There are still several rounds left, and rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to make another counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 720000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's sticking to a range above my initial target.  I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, aiming to meet her halfway.  This shows I'm serious about buying but also that I'm not willing to overpay.  With only a few rounds left, we need to get closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds left, the time for further negotiation is running out. Alice is clearly not willing to budge much further, and I'm close to my target price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a decent price while leaving some room to potentially get an even better deal in the future."
