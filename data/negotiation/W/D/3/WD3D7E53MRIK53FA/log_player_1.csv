{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that allows for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit. 
* **The message:** It's friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:**  This allows for room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Focus on value:** By highlighting the product's worth, I aim to pique Bob's interest.
* **Prepared for counteroffers:** I am ready to negotiate and potentially adjust the price based on Bob's response. 
* **The John fallback:** Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net and prevents me from settling for a price below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but based on my research and budget, I am only able to offer $10000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.** 
* **I'm not willing to settle for a loss.**  
* **Rejecting his offer allows me to try and negotiate a higher price.**

**Next Steps:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $10,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This still gives you a great price, and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I've made a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Reasoning:**  I explain the counteroffer by referencing the value of the product, emphasizing that $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Closing:** I conclude with a question to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer aims to meet halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I continue to emphasize the product's value to maintain Bob's interest.
* **Positioning for a deal:**  By showing willingness to negotiate, I am positioning myself to secure a mutually beneficial agreement."
