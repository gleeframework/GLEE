Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA)"":**  Exists between $1,000,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not scare Bob off. Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. It offers significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting confidently above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** While not explicitly stating why, hinting at ""careful consideration"" implies your price is well-founded.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone is positive and encourages Bob to engage in discussion. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob is likely to counter-offer. Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go.
* **John as Leverage:**  You don't need to mention John directly, but knowing you have a backup offer gives you negotiating power."
