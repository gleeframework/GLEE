Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for potential negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price higher than Bob's value, I'm leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. However, I also have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails. This gives me leverage and ensures I won't settle for a price that is significantly lower than what I consider the product to be worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm choosing to reject his offer and proceed to the next round to see if I can push for a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell and I'm willing to walk away if necessary. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob, potentially motivating him to raise his offer.  However, I have the safety net of selling to John for $12,000, which gives me a strong bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between his offer of $9,000 and my previous offer of $10,000. 

**Strategy:**

By making a small concession, I'm showing flexibility while still trying to achieve a price closer to my target. I believe this counteroffer is appealing enough for Bob to consider, while still leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary.  I'm confident that I can achieve a mutually agreeable price without having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, the risk of further negotiation failing and having to sell to John at $12,000 is not worth it. 

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and guarantees a profit. While it's not the ideal outcome, it's a reasonable compromise considering the potential risks of further negotiation. I'm satisfied with the outcome as it allows me to move on to other opportunities."
