"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that you're willing to sell it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but I need to at least get $9,000 for it.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
