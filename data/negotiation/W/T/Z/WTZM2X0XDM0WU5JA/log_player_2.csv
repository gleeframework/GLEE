"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than John's offer of $12,000.
* **You're still within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer allows you to get the product while saving $500 compared to buying from John."
