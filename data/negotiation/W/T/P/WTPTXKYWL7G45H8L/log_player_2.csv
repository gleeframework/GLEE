"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a limited time at $150. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and the value of the product to Alice. There's plenty of room for negotiation.  You should reject this initial offer and make a counteroffer much closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Testing the Waters:** By offering $60, you're aiming to see how low Alice is willing to go. If she accepts, you've secured a great deal. If she counters, you'll have a better idea of a reasonable compromise.
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you can always walk away and buy the product from John for $100 if negotiations with Alice don't go your way."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $60 is quite low for the value this item provides. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down significantly from her initial offer, $110 is still above your $100 budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, having moved considerably from her initial price. 
* **John as Backup:**  You have the security of John's offer at $100 if negotiations with Alice don't yield a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However,  $110 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:**  You are gradually moving your offer closer to your maximum budget while still aiming for a price significantly below Alice's last offer.
* **Testing Flexibility:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further. A large jump from your previous offer might make her less inclined to counter.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  You're positioning yourself in a good spot for a potential compromise. Alice might counter with a price between $80 and $110, getting you closer to a deal."
