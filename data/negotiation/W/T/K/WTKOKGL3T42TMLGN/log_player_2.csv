"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $2,000 over Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible while still getting the product.  Starting with a counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's seriousness in negotiating. This price is also below Bob's maximum budget, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Since there are still rounds available, rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer gives Bob a better chance at achieving a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to increase his offer slightly to $9,500. This shows that he is serious about buying the product and willing to compromise, but still within his budget. This price is a reasonable middle ground, potentially leading to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price higher than Bob's maximum budget.  While it's getting closer, there are still rounds available to negotiate a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but still remaining within his budget.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while also showing that he is not willing to go much higher.  By offering $9,750, Bob is making a clear attempt to meet Alice halfway, potentially leading to a successful deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there are still a couple of rounds remaining.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially get a better price.  Bob is aiming for a price closer to $10,000, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to compromise further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final counteroffer.  He's offering his maximum budget of $10,000.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate down to a point close to her value, and this is a good final attempt to see if she'll accept and make a deal. If Alice rejects, Bob can still purchase the product from John for the same price."
