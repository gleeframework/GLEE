"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a number that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done, but I'm not willing to go below this price. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you, given that it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,400,000 was a bit above your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a good price for both of us.  This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
