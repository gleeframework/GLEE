"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our unique product to you. This extraordinary item holds immense value to us, but considering its significance to you, we believe it would be fair to propose a price of $1,200,000. We understand the importance of this product to you and hope this offer reflects our commitment to making this transaction beneficial for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  While John offers a higher price, there's a chance Alice will be willing to drop her price enough to make a deal more beneficial for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and your potential profit. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway. In order to ensure a satisfactory outcome for both parties, we would like to propose a revised price of $1,100,000 for the product. This figure aims to provide a reasonable profit for us while still being within your budget considerations. We look forward to your response and hope to reach an agreement that benefits us all.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, but there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue to try and bring the price down further. Buying from John is still a less desirable option, as it significantly exceeds Bob's budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest proposal, Bob. We understand your position and are willing to consider it. In light of this, we would like to offer a price of $1,090,000 for the product. This figure aims to strike a balance between our profit expectations and your budget constraints. We believe this could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. Please let us know your thoughts on this proposal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,090,000, which is only $20,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult and time-consuming.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is still within his budget and reasonably close to his desired price.  Buying from John is still a less desirable option as it is significantly higher than the current offer."
