"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves a good margin for you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
