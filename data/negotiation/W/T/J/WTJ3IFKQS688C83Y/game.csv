"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  While I think this product is great,  $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you consider $10,000? I'm ready to buy today if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $11,000? It's a great compromise that still gets you a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
