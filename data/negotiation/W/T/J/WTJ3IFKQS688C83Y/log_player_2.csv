"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counteroffer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  While I think this product is great,  $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you consider $10,000? I'm ready to buy today if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $11,000? It's a great compromise that still gets you a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks going back and forth and potentially losing the deal.  It's a good compromise, and Bob can still save $1000 compared to buying from John."
