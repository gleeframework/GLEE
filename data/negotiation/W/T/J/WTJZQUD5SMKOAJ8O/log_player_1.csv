Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay more than he thinks it's worth. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price to $140, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low and I don't want to risk going lower and ending up with a profit below my minimum.  I'll sell to John for $150 to guarantee a decent profit."
