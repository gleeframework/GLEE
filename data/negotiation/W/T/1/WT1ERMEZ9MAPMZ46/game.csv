"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you tailoring it to my interest. However, $10,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of our product. I am unable to accept $8,500. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering $9,000 for the product?",9000.0,Alice,3,
