Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation. It's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but gives him a chance to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product's worth. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired amount.  I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can secure a better deal than Bob's current offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm feeling $1300000 is a fair price that allows for a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not convinced it's a good deal for me. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, giving me a safety net."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1250000. How about $1275000? This is a fair compromise that allows us to finalize the deal quickly.
