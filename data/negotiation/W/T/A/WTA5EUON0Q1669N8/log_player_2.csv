It's too early to buy from Alice at that price, especially since I have a fallback option with John. I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."

While $4,200 is closer to my ideal price, it's still a bit high, and I want to see if I can negotiate a better price. I have 5 more rounds, so I can still make some counteroffers before resorting to John."

With only one round remaining, it's not likely that Alice will come down to a price I'm willing to pay.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John."
