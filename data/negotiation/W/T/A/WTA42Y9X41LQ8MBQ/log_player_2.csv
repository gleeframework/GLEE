"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $140 is too close to his maximum price of $150. It's worth seeing if he can get a better deal with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  $130 is a reasonable counteroffer that still leaves room for negotiation, but is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This move signals Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously, while still keeping his maximum price in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's still lower than Bob's maximum price of $150, and it's within the range of what Bob was hoping for after his counteroffer. There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and the risk of going to John means paying a higher price. It's a good time to close the deal."
