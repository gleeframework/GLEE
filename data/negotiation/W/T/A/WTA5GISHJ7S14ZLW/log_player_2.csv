"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  

**Next Steps:**

Bob should make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round, aiming for a price closer to his $15,000 limit or lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $13,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob is starting with a modest counteroffer, aiming to  reduce the price while remaining within a reasonable range. 
* **Value Proposition:** Bob is signaling his interest in the product but also establishing a starting point for further negotiation.
* **Next Steps:**  The goal is to see if Alice will accept the counteroffer. If she rejects it, Bob can continue to negotiate or consider buying from John as a backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $13,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $13,800 is within Bob's budget and is a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, making it likely that further negotiation will only yield a small price reduction. 
* **Risk of Delay:** Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice becoming less flexible, or Bob running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial option at this point."
