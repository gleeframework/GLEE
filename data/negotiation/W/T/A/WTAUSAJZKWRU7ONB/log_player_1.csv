Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This would still give you a great deal considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to propose a price of $825,000. I hope this is closer to what you're comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's a good deal for me, and I'm confident that I won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
