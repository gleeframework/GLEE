"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $120. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. This still gives me some wiggle room, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $125 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140 as a final offer. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",140.0,Alice,5,
