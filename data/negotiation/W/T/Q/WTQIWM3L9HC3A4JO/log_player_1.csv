{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but lower than my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a chance to potentially earn more.
* **Friendly approach:** A friendly message makes Bob feel comfortable and might encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message implies I'm open to negotiation, which could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've made a profit!
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll wait for his counteroffer and analyze whether it's worth pursuing further. I'll consider his counteroffer, my minimum price, and John's offer.
* **If the negotiation isn't fruitful:** I'll switch to selling to John for $150, ensuring I at least get my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $120. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $150.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially getting closer to my desired price.
* **Consider John's offer:**  While John is willing to pay $150, I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob first. 

**Next steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price that's higher than $120 but lower than my minimum $150. I'll aim to strike a deal that's profitable for me while still being attractive to Bob.  
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll assess the situation and decide whether to accept his offer or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. This still gives me some wiggle room, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to my minimum:**  I'm offering $130, which is just $20 below my minimum price of $150. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but not at a loss to myself.
* **Appeal to fairness:**  I emphasize the ""fair price for both of us"" to create a sense of mutual benefit.
* **Open to further discussion:** I end the message with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially reach an agreement.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a profitable sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze the situation and determine if I want to make a final counteroffer, or if I should sell to John for $150 to guarantee a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $150 threshold. I can't afford to sell for less.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  I've already lowered my price twice, and further concessions would be detrimental to my profit.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer or sell to John:** I will make one final counteroffer to Bob at $140, hoping to reach a compromise. If he rejects this, I will proceed with selling to John for $150 to guarantee my profit."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $125 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140 as a final offer. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final counteroffer:** This is my last offer before switching to John. I'm trying to get as close to my minimum as possible.
* **Compromise language:**  I'm emphasizing ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:**  I'm suggesting a ""closing deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a profitable sale close to my minimum price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'm confident John will purchase the product for $150."
