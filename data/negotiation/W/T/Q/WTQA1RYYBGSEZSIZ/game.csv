"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is fantastic, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1050000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1175000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1175000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1225000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
