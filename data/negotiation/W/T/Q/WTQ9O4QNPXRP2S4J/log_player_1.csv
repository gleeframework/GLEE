Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Reservation Price:** $1,500,000 (This is the minimum she'll accept)
* **Bob's Valuation:** $1,200,000 
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** $1,500,000

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale at her reservation price with John.  Therefore, she should aim to get as much as possible from Bob without going below $1,500,000.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  I know it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. While my asking price is $1,600,000, I'm open to discussing a figure that works well for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Negotiable Starting Point:** Alice starts high ($1,600,000) to leave room for negotiation while staying above her reservation price.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message emphasizes a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable countering. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Counter:**  Bob will likely counter with an offer below $1,200,000. Alice should be prepared to negotiate but hold firm above her $1,500,000 reservation price. 
* **Walking Away:** If Bob isn't willing to go above $1,500,000, Alice should politely decline and proceed with selling to John."
