"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $162.50. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",162.5,Alice,3,

"I'm still not willing to go as low as $155, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $160. It's a fair price that still gives me a decent profit, and I think you'll find it's a good value.",160.0,Alice,5,
