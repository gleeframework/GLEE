Round 2

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is significantly below what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,750 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,250, which is a good compromise.  It's important for me to get at least that much to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting closer to my asking price. However, $7,900 is still a little below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $8,050.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $8,000. She's consistently met in the middle, and while further negotiation is possible, it's risky. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your target price."
