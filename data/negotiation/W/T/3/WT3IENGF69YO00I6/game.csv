"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice! I'm interested in making a deal, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm making a counteroffer of $11000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11000. I'm willing to make a counter-counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $12500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $11500, as I mentioned earlier. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider my offer?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $13000. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit off track. I'm still very interested in the product, but I really need to keep my costs down. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll give you $11000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to keep costs down, Bob, but I'm not willing to sacrifice the value of the product. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $12750. It's a fair price considering the product's worth, and I'm willing to meet you halfway to reach a deal.",12750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product, but I'm really struggling to justify spending more than $11000. I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll give you $11000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $15000.",11000.0,Bob,8,
