Alice's offer is way too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Let's start with a price that's closer to my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, but I'm open to negotiation."

Alice is clearly not willing to come down to a price that's comfortable for me. At this point, it's better to secure the product from John for $1,000,000.  It's a guaranteed deal, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Alice."
