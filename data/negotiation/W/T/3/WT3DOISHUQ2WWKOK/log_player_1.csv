"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  While $800,000 is the product's worth to Bob, I believe I can push for a slightly higher price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is a significant amount, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob, and if not, I can always sell to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal profit margin. This counteroffer should be more appealing to Bob, and hopefully, it will lead us to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my ideal price, I want to see if I can push for a bit more.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I think I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only slightly. This is a compromise, reflecting Bob's desire for a lower price and my own desire to maximize my profit. I believe this offer is fair and could be attractive to Bob, given the limited rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is tempting, I'm still hopeful that I can secure a slightly higher price.  The negotiation is getting tense, but I have a few more rounds to try and get closer to my target. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

With only a few rounds remaining, I'm making my final push for a price closer to my initial goal.  I believe Bob is getting closer to his limit, and this offer should be tempting enough for him to accept. If not, I'm prepared to sell to John at $800,000 and end the negotiation."
