"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $8,500?  This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,250. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming to pay as close to $8,000 as possible. He has 7 rounds left, and it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This feels like a fair compromise, considering your product's worth to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to go down to $8,750. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $9,100. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected two counteroffers, and Alice has clearly stated this is her final offer. While it's still higher than Bob's ideal price, it's closer to the product's worth to Alice than the price John is offering.  With 5 rounds remaining, it's safer to accept this offer and secure the product for a decent price. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk of Alice walking away or Bob being forced to buy from John at a much higher cost."
