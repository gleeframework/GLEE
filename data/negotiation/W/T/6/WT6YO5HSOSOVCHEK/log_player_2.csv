```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110, which is still a good deal for you and within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a final offer from me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
