``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves some room for negotiation. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, but it gives me a good starting point and allows me to see if he's truly interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground.  If Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your flexibility. However, $8,750 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,875.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit below my minimum, and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm confident that John will buy the product for $10,000.  It's time to move on and secure the better deal."
