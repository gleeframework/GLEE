"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This reflects the value it holds for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit steep.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $10,750 for the product.  This would give us both a fair deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm offering the product to you for $11,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
