"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is within his budget, he can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price, or Bob could make a counteroffer that Alice might accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above John's price. This allows for room for negotiation while also showing Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than John's offer. Bob is determined to save as much money as possible and should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price from Alice. He has several rounds left and a guaranteed fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to John's price, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This is a more aggressive counteroffer, showing Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget but wants to save as much as possible. He should continue to negotiate. Even if Alice rejects his next counteroffer, he has a guaranteed fallback option with John. With several rounds remaining, there's a good chance he can get a price closer to his ideal $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1030000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to his goal of $1,000,000 while also being mindful of Alice's potential willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is a small increment from his previous one, showing Alice that he's serious about getting a deal but is also willing to compromise.  It's likely Alice is getting closer to her lower limit, and a few more rounds of negotiation might get them to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,050,000, which is only $50,000 more than John's price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might reject his next counteroffer, and he would be forced to buy from John. At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product while minimizing the price difference. It's a good deal, and the risk of trying to negotiate further is not worth it."
