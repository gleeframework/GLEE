"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, you can likely do better.  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $120. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm interested but  $130 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125?  I'm really looking to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is a great fit for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $127.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $127.50 is very close to my ideal price of $125.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my offer again and ending up paying $150 to John is too high. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
