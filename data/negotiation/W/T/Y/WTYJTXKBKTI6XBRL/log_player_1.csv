{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is above my minimum value of $120. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a positive message to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to let Bob know I'm open to discussing the price.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  I will need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and my assessment of his interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my target. 
* **John as a safety net:** While John offers a guaranteed $120, I'm not desperate to sell to him just yet. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! While I value your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, how about $130?  I think it's a fair price considering the quality of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I show that I heard Bob's offer and am willing to negotiate.
* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $130 is a compromise, showing that I'm flexible. 
* **Highlight the product's value:** Reminding Bob of the product's quality can help him justify a higher price.
* **Open ended question:** This allows Bob to either accept or counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $100 would be a fair price for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:** While $115 is closer to my minimum price of $120, it's still below my target. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can get closer to $120. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $120, which I'm not afraid to take if I can't get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $115 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a little hesitant.  How about $118? That's only $3 away from your offer, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 118} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show appreciation:**  I acknowledge Bob's efforts and express gratitude for his persistence.
* **Offer a small compromise:** $118 is a minor concession from my previous offer but still a fair price considering my minimum value.
* **Highlight the small gap:** Emphasizing the small difference between our offers can make it seem like a minor hurdle to overcome.
* **Open ended question:** I encourage Bob to consider my offer and respond with a decision or a counteroffer."
