"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! While I value your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, how about $130?  I think it's a fair price considering the quality of the product.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $100 would be a fair price for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $115 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a little hesitant.  How about $118? That's only $3 away from your offer, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think.",118.0,Alice,5,
