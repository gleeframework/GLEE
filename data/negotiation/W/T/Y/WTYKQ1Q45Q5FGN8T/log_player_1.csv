Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product for $99 is a strong strategic move. It's just below your guaranteed price but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob the impression of a deal while maximizing your potential profit. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is straightforward and highlights the offer without being overly pushy."
