"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price.  Since I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John, I have room to negotiate and can afford to be somewhat aggressive in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still lower than what I initially hoped for. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating to try and get a higher price.  I still have 8 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $15,000 to $13,500. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial goal.  I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now only $500 below my initial offer.  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.  Accepting his offer will guarantee me a sale above my minimum value, and I can move on to other opportunities."
