"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. It's better to reject it and see if we can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $150, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my limit. It's better to buy the product from John for $100, even though I'm giving up the chance to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
