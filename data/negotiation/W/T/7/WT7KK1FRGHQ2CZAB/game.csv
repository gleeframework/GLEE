"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $150, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",150.0,Alice,3,
