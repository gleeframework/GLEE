Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $100 as possible, but still give Bob a reason to buy.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $95 is a price that gives you a significant profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It's a $15 discount from your ""backup"" price with John.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and focuses on the value proposition for Bob."
