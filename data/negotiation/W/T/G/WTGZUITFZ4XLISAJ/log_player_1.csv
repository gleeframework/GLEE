Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $95. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

* **Starting High:** I want to start with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($100) than my minimum ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $95, I signal that I'm open to negotiation but still value the product highly. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to buy and how much bargaining power I have. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is more than my minimum, I know Bob values the product at $100. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further to see if I can capture more of that value.  I'll aim for a price closer to $90 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm coming down by $5 from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price above Bob's initial offer.
* **Simple and Clear:** This counteroffer is straightforward and keeps the negotiation moving. 
* **Close to Target:** $90 is a good compromise that allows me to potentially earn a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your price, Alice. I would like to counter with $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob seems anchored at $85. There's a risk he walks away if I push further, leaving me to sell to John for $80. 
* **Profitable Sale:**  $85 is still a $5 profit over my guaranteed sale to John. It's better to secure a good profit now than risk losing the sale entirely."
