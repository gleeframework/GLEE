Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is based on the assumption that the product is valuable and I want to maximize my profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I can always lower the price or sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,750.  This is a compromise, but still higher than Bob's offer.  Hopefully, he'll see it as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer $9,750, $9,600 is still a good price and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal entirely."
