"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay that price for the potential benefits it could bring to my business.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can see the potential benefits of this product for your business, and I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll sell it to you for $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, considering its potential benefits to my business.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1500000. However, I'm still a bit concerned that we might be leaving some value on the table. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell it to you for $1600000, but that's as high as I can go. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and potential benefits to your business.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more compromise, but I'm afraid $1600000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but that's my final offer. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and get a deal done.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
