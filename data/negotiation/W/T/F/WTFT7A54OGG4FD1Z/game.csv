"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  It's a fair price, and it allows us both to make a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  Let's split the difference - how about $900,000? This price recognizes the value of the product while still giving you a good deal.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
