"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price that reflects its exceptional value.  Considering its potential, I believe $950,000 is a fair price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  He should counteroffer and see if he can get Alice to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  It's a fair price, and it allows us both to make a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  Let's split the difference - how about $900,000? This price recognizes the value of the product while still giving you a good deal.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high. John is offering the product for $800,000, which is the best price available. There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
