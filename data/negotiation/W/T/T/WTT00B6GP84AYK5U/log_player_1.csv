"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I appreciate his interest, $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $1,350,000? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000? I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the true value of the product.  I'll counter with a price closer to my previous offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to. However, $1,250,000 still doesn't cover the value I'm placing on this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous offer. Let's try $1,300,000. This is a very fair price, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, but I'm still not sure $1,300,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting a little concerned about time running out,  $1,200,000 is still too low for me. I'm hoping that with a few more rounds of negotiation, we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to find some common ground."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to make one final concession to try and close this deal. How about $1,275,000?  This is the lowest I can go.  If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is my absolute maximum budget. If you can accept this price, I'll make this deal happen.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I would prefer to get a higher price from Bob, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  With only two rounds left, it's too risky to keep negotiating with Bob. I don't want to end up with nothing. Selling to John guarantees me a good profit, and it's the best option for me at this point."
