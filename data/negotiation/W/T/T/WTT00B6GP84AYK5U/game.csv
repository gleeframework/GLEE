,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $1,350,000? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000? I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to be within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to. However, $1,250,000 still doesn't cover the value I'm placing on this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous offer. Let's try $1,300,000. This is a very fair price, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, but I'm still not sure $1,300,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that price?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to make one final concession to try and close this deal. How about $1,275,000?  This is the lowest I can go.  If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to consider my other options.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is my absolute maximum budget. If you can accept this price, I'll make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
