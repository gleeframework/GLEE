"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. While I value it at $1200000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a significant discount, and it's a price I'm confident will be beneficial for both of us. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details further. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another interested party. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
