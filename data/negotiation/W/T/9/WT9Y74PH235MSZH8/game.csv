"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I think it's a fair price considering the potential returns you'll get.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Given my research and the market value, I'd be willing to offer $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in its value at $1,000,000, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $925,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is fair given the product's market value.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
