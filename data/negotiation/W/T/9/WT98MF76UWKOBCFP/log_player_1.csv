Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a strategic decision. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and ensures a healthy profit margin. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging negotiations has a cost.  Closing the deal now puts the money in hand to be reinvested elsewhere. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  There's always a risk Bob could walk away. Accepting a strong offer secures the deal."
