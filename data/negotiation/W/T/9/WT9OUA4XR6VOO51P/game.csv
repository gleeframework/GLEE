"Alice,  $12,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 reflects the product's true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you believe the product is worth $12,000, but $10,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
