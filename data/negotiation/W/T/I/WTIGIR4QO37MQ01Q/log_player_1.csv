Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I want to make this work. However, my budget is really pushing its limit.  Could you do $10,750? I'm hoping we can find an agreement on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is clearly very interested and is steadily increasing his offer.  Accepting $10,750 ensures a good profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in further rounds."
