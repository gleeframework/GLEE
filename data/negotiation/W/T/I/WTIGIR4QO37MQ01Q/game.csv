"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 at the moment.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident you'll see its value at that price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,000 is closer, but I need the price to be a bit lower. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I want to make this work. However, my budget is really pushing its limit.  Could you do $10,750? I'm hoping we can find an agreement on this.",10750.0,Bob,6,
