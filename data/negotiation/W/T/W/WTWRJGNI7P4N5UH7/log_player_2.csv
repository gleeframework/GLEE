"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is $120.** This is more than your maximum budget of $150.
* **You have the option to buy from John for $150.**  While this is your upper limit, it's still a better deal than accepting Alice's offer. 

Rejecting Alice's offer means you can still get the product, but at a lower price from John."
