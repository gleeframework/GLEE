Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're already getting more than your minimum of $120.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is likely to want a lower price, giving you room to negotiate. 
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob sees the product as worth $150, so there's potential for a deal that benefits both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $125 is still above my minimum of $120 and a decent deal.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get me a higher price, and I risk losing the sale altogether.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale."
