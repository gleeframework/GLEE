"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product would be valuable to me, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch. To keep this moving, how about we settle at $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $925,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope you can meet me at this point.",925000.0,Alice,5,
