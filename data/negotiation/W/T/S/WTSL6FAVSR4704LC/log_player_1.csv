Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,400,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This is a fair price, as it's still significantly more than what I could get it for elsewhere.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.
