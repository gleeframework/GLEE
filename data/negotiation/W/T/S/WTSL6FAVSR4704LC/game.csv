"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,400,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This is a fair price, as it's still significantly more than what I could get it for elsewhere.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,250,000 is your maximum budget, but I believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's unique features and potential returns. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,320,000. This is my final offer before considering other options. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
