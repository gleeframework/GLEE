"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  You can aim for a lower price, potentially closer to your $800,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counteroffer process and potentially save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still significantly higher than your desired price point.  You should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  It's important to remember that Alice is willing to sell for $800,000, so there's still room for a good deal to be struck."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $962,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 962500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $962,500 is close, but I'm aiming for something a bit closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider $985,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $985,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $962,500.  It's a good compromise, and you're getting a better price than John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to further concessions, but it's also possible that Alice could become unwilling to sell at a lower price.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product at a price within your budget and a good deal compared to John's offer."
