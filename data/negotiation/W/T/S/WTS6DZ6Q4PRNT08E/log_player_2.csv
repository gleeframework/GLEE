Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a fair price considering the product's potential, and it gives us both a chance to make a good deal.
