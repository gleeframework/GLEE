Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is still a bit low for me, and I think I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go lower than $90. This product is truly valuable, and I believe $90 is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. There are only a few rounds left, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $88.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 88}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, it's clear that Bob and I are not going to reach an agreement. While I'd prefer to get more than $80, it's not worth risking getting nothing at all.  Selling to John at $80 is the best option at this point."
