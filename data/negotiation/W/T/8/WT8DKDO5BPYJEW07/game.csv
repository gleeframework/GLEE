"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I still feel that we're not quite there yet.

"I understand you're still looking to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1325000, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm going to make a final counteroffer at $1320000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
