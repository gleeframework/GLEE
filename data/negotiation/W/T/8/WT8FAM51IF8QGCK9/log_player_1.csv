Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm willing to make this transaction particularly smooth for you and am proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, there's a chance to earn an extra $400,000 if Bob accepts our offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,400,000 is still significantly beneficial for Bob (a $400,000 gain for him) while leaving a substantial profit margin for us.
* **Exclusivity:** By phrasing the offer as ""exclusive"" and highlighting a ""smooth transaction,"" we subtly nudge Bob towards a quick decision, potentially avoiding prolonged negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Depending on your risk appetite and any additional information about Bob's negotiating style, you could adjust the price slightly higher or lower."
