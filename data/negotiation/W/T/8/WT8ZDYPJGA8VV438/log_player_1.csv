"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes my desired price point and leaves room for negotiation. I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay before considering John's offer of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price point, but I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but it also leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary. I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial $1,000,000 goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $925,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly better than John's offer of $800,000.  We've already had several rounds of negotiation, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of time.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer."
