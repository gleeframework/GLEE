"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it! I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering it for $11,000. There's room for negotiation to save money.
* **More rounds are available.** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's no need to rush into accepting the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer.**  $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Alice's minimum price of $10,000.
* **Show willingness to negotiate.** The message conveys that you're interested in the product but are also seeking a fair price."

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit higher than my ideal price point.  How about $10,750? This seems like a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slightly higher price than your previous offer.**  This shows that you're serious about buying the product but still want to save money.
