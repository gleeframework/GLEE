Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is slightly below Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and focuses on the potential value to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counter-offer, making the negotiation feel more collaborative.
* **Plan B:** I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategy:**  By rejecting, I can make a counter-offer and try to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $13,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone in the message can help keep the negotiation from becoming adversarial. 
* **Clear Expectations:**  The message makes it clear that I'm still looking for a higher price but am open to reaching a fair agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $13,250 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and it's significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Rejecting again and counter-offering risks Bob walking away, and I might end up stuck with John's lower offer.
* **Time is Money:**  The negotiation has already gone a few rounds, and continuing might prolong the process, potentially leading to a lower price or a missed opportunity. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** Accepting Bob's offer is a strategic compromise that allows me to secure a decent profit while avoiding unnecessary delays or risks."
