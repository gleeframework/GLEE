Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my spending under $8000. Would you consider lowering the price to $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still aiming to keep my budget under $8000. Could you possibly lower the price to $8750?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price. If he doesn't budge, I can always sell to John for $10,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While $8,900 is closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $9,000. There are still rounds left, so I want to see if I can push Bob a little further. If he doesn't budge, I can always sell to John."
