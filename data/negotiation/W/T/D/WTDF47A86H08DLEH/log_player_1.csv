Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1500000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1100000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let me know what you think.
