Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000,  which still allows me to make a reasonable profit. I believe the product is worth this value to you and hope you'll consider it. Let's find a middle ground.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000.

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1250000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to go with John's offer.  It's a sure thing, and saves me $50,000."
