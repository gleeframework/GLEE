"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1500000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1100000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000,  which still allows me to make a reasonable profit. I believe the product is worth this value to you and hope you'll consider it. Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
