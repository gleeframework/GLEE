**Reasoning:**

Bob is highly unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  He's consistently stayed below $1,000,000, and while his increases are getting smaller, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a significant profit and eliminates further uncertainty."
