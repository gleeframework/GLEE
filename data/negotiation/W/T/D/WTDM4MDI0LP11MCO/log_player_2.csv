"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($950,000 vs $800,000), but it's still significantly less than what Bob is willing to pay ($1,500,000).  Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. While there's a risk that Alice might walk away, it's worth trying to bring the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. After re-evaluating the value of the product, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $885000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $885,000, which is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk of Alice walking away increases. Accepting this offer means saving $615,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially advantageous decision at this point."
