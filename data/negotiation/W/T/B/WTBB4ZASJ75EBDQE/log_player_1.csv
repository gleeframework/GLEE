Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Framing as a deal:** The message emphasizes the deal Bob is getting by purchasing at this price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates I'm open to discussing the offer, encouraging Bob to respond.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John allows me to be more aggressive in negotiating with Bob. 
* **Potential counteroffers:** I anticipate Bob will counteroffer. I'll adjust my subsequent counteroffers based on his response and the need to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Can you meet me at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob's counteroffer is closer to my target price, but I believe I can still get a better deal. 
* **John as leverage:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. 
* **Room for counteroffers:** There's still a gap between my desired price and Bob's offer, which allows for further negotiation. 

**Next Step:**

I will counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price reflects the value you'll get from the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I've dropped my price by $50,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above Bob's value:**  The price is still higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's getting closer to what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Emphasis on value:** The message highlights the value Bob will get from the product, hoping to make him more agreeable to the price.
* **""Meeting in the middle"" approach:** This implies a sense of compromise and fairness, which could make Bob more inclined to accept the offer.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's offer as a safety net:** I'm confident in my ability to secure $1,200,000 from John, so I can be more firm in my negotiations with Bob.
* **Anticipating counteroffers:** I expect Bob to counteroffer again. I'll be prepared to adjust my next counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000. Can you consider $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $925,000 is only $75,000 away from my initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant gain considering the product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate may result in a lower price or a stalemate, potentially leading to me having to sell to John at a lower profit. 
* **Time factor:**  While I could continue negotiating,  accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly and move on.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's offer:**  While selling to John for $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm confident I can achieve a reasonable profit by accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Future negotiations:**  Accepting this offer allows me to avoid the potential for lengthy and uncertain negotiations with Bob."
