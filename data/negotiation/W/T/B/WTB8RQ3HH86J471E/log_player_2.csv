You have three options:

Alice's offer is too high.  You can likely get a better price by counteroffering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $92, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice's offer is still higher than your target. You can try to counteroffer again and see if she's willing to come down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference at $88? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

While $90 is still above your ideal price, it's a good compromise. You're still getting a significant discount compared to John's offer, and continuing to negotiate risks the chance of Alice walking away entirely."
