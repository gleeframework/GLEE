"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the value of the product to us and your budget, I would like to suggest a price of $105 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm happy to see you're willing to come down in price.  $105 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm sure we can both agree this is a fair price.",100.0,Bob,4,
