{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a good starting point and gives Bob a reason to engage in a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $125? I really think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $125 is above my minimum acceptable price of $100. It's also a good deal for me considering the potential of going back and forth with further counteroffers.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
