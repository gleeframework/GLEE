"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product at a competitive price of $14,000. I think you'll find this a very appealing offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to consider $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise:** $13,500 is a fair middle ground, bringing the price closer to Bob's target range.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or Bob having to pay John's higher price.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Time spent negotiating could be spent elsewhere.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice, balancing the desire for a lower price with the potential risks of further negotiation."
