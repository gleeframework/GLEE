"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. This is a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $110 to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a middle ground.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $105. It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
