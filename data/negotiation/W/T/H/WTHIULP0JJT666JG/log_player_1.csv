Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the price to encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Openness:** I invite Bob to share his thoughts, suggesting a willingness to negotiate further. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value while acknowledging Bob's interests.
* **Avoid immediate rejection:** A high starting point may deter Bob, but it gives me more leverage to negotiate down.
* **Maintain control:** By inviting Bob's thoughts, I control the negotiation and can react strategically to his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.**  Accepting it would result in a huge loss for me.
* **Bob's offer is also significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,000,000.**  This suggests that he may be willing to negotiate further.
* **Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value.** However, I'm not willing to give up on potentially getting a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than my minimum. I'll need to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and determine if further negotiations are worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with Compromise:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's a significant step down from my initial $1,000,000, but still above Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Open-Ended Invitation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by inviting Bob to find ""common ground.""

This approach is designed to:

* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm not dropping my price drastically, which ensures I'm not giving up too much ground.
* **Encourage Further Negotiation:** My counteroffer is a clear signal that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoid a Stalemate:**  I'm hoping to avoid a situation where we both refuse to budge, leading me to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is only $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Rejecting Bob's offer might lead to a stalemate, forcing me to sell to John at a lower profit. 
* **Time Factor:** It's unclear how much longer Bob will be willing to negotiate.  Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal and secure a good profit, even if it's not my ideal price.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical choice. It balances the risk of losing a sale with the possibility of a quick and profitable transaction."
