"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth a bit more than that. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand your perspective, Alice. Let me counter with $105 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise considering its value to me.",105.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,115.0
"I see you're willing to meet me at $105, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not sure if that's the best we can do. I'm willing to go up to $115, but I think I can do better than that. How about we meet at $112.50? It's a bit more than your offer, but still a good compromise.",112.5,Alice,5,,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I'd like to make a small adjustment to get closer to my target price. How about $112? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for a deal with you.",112.0,Alice,7,,
