"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this fantastic product for $850000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price of $800,000.  Therefore, it's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 780000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $780000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. How about $820000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we could finalise the deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than Bob's maximum price of $800,000.  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price, and if unsuccessful, he can always buy from John for $800,000."
