"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $14,000 is a fair price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. How about we split the difference again and go with $15,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $13,500 is a fair price.",13500.0,Bob,6,
