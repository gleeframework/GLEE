{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high (but not unreasonably so) allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing on a price higher than $15,000. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $14,500 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This might make Bob feel like he's getting a ""deal"" if he manages to negotiate the price down a bit, even if it's still above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't know how much Bob is willing to pay. If you had more information about Bob's budget or the product's importance to him, you could adjust your strategy."
