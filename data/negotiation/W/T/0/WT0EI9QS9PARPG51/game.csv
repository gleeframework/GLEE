"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that I believe you'll find invaluable. Given its worth to me and its value to you, I propose a price of $140 for it. This price reflects the balance between what I believe the product is worth and what you're willing to pay. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",140.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering your product, and I see the value in it. However, $140 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  This would give you a fair profit while staying within my price range.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,,
