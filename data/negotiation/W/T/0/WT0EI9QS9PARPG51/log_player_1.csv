Given its worth to me and its value to you, I propose a price of $140 for it. This price reflects the balance between what I believe the product is worth and what you're willing to pay. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering your product, and I see the value in it. However, $140 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  This would give you a fair profit while staying within my price range.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"", ""final_price"": 125}"
