"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it reflects the fact that the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still well above my minimum. I hope he sees the value in the product and is willing to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to get more, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer. I'm accepting his offer to ensure I secure the sale."
