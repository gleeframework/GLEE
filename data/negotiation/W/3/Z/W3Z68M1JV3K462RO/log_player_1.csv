"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very special product that I believe will be of great interest to you.  It's worth at least a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its unique value.  My initial offer is $1,500,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I can offer $800000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a substantial amount, it's significantly less than the minimum value I've placed on the product.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target.  I'm also confident in the product's value and willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer the product to you for $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I'm confident in the product's value and believe I can still get a better price from Bob, or at least get closer to my desired price.  I'm also willing to risk another round of negotiation before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate your continued interest.  $900,000 is still below what I'm comfortable accepting.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to achieve a profitable sale."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1025000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum desired price. I've only got four rounds left, and I'm not quite ready to settle for the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John yet. I believe there's a good chance I can get Bob to come up a bit more, and I'm willing to risk another round to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I see your willingness to go higher, and I appreciate that. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $975,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to achieve a profitable sale. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to work with me, but $975000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to our last two rounds, and Bob has repeatedly refused to budge from his offer of $950,000. While it's tempting to try one more counteroffer, the risk is too high.  I've already lowered my price significantly, and there's a real chance Bob will simply stick to his offer, leaving me with no room for negotiation.  With only two rounds left, I can't afford to risk losing this opportunity.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a profitable sale, and it's the safest option at this point."
