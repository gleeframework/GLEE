Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is close to my minimum, I think I can still get a better deal if I keep negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $82.50 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful I can get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good price, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about $87.50?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 87.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $87.50. How about we meet at $80? That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it's not clear if I can get him to go higher. To avoid potentially wasting more time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $80."
