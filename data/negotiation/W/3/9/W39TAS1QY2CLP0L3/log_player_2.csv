{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always best to try and negotiate a better price.  $7,500 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $6,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a reasonable price considering I'm willing to pay $10,000 from John. This counteroffer shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $7,000 is better than her initial offer, but I can still do better. I'm confident that I can negotiate a lower price. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a deal closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $6,750. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still willing to negotiate.  This offer is a compromise,  splitting the difference between my last offer and hers. Hopefully, Alice will see that this is a fair price and accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price point, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm not yet willing to accept $7,250, as I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6875}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time only by a small amount to $6,875. This shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm still not willing to go much higher.  With only 5 rounds left, I need to start closing the gap, but I still want to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price point, but I'm still not ready to give in.  I believe I can negotiate a lower price, especially with only 4 rounds left. I'm going to try to push for a price closer to my last offer. If Alice continues to refuse, I will likely accept her offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $7,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows Alice that I am willing to meet her halfway. However, with only three rounds left, I need to start getting closer to her offers to ensure we close a deal. I'm hoping that Alice will see this as a fair price and finally accept my offer. If she rejects, I will likely accept her offer in the next round to avoid the risk of not buying the product at all."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,450. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,450
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, it's time to accept Alice's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal compared to buying from John.  There's a risk of not reaching a deal with Alice and being forced to buy from John, which would cost me more. Accepting the offer now ensures I get the product at a price that's within my budget."
