"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $65 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. $75 is still too low for me. How about we settle on $85? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
