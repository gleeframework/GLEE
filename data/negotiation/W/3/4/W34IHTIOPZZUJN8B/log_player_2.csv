"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this product, Bob. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower since the product is only worth $8,000 to her. By rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to get a better deal."
