"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to your operations. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, as it's worth more to you than to any other buyer.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing further.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
