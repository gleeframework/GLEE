Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a profit significantly higher than what I would get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is not acceptable. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is still a good price for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise given Bob's initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
