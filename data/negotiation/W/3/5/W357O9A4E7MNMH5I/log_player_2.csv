"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're only willing to pay $10,000, and Alice is asking for $14,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:** You have a clear target price, and Alice is likely willing to negotiate to make a sale. 
* **John is a backup option:**  Knowing you can get the product for $10,000 from John gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting strong:**  I'm offering my maximum price immediately. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal.
* **No room for ambiguity:**  A clear, low offer establishes my position and forces Alice to respond. 
* **Leveraging John:**  Alice knows I can walk away and get the product for $10,000 elsewhere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:**  $12,000 is still above my budget. 
* **More room for negotiation:** Alice has already lowered her price, indicating she's motivated to make a sale. 
* **John remains a viable option:**  I can still walk away and buy from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My previous offer was $10,000, and Alice's is $12,000. This counteroffer offers a compromise.
* **Showing flexibility:**  It demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate but still have a firm price point in mind. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Knowing John's offer, I'm not desperate for a deal and can walk away if needed."
