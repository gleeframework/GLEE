Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable.  I'm asking for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I'm above my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Positive Framing:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value to Bob rather than just focusing on the price. 

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind John's standing offer of $100 as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is above my minimum, I think I can still negotiate a better price from Bob.  His counteroffer suggests he's quite interested in the product. I'll aim for a price closer to $110 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  It's a really fair price for such a valuable product."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($115) and Bob's counteroffer ($105).
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Maintaining Firmness:** I'm holding my ground closer to my desired price, but still leaving room for a potential final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $110 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a little lower. Could we do $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly demonstrating that he's willing to negotiate but also has a firm budget in mind.  While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in another round, the gains would be minimal ($2 at most). Accepting his offer of $108 secures a profit and avoids the risk of him backing out entirely, leaving me to sell to John for $100."
