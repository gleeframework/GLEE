"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $12,000. We'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is just too low for me. How about $10,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We're getting closer, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'll try to get Alice down a little more."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $10,000 is my absolute top limit for this product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
