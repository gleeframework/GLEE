"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting with a price that's still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation. If you reject her offer, you can:

* **Potentially get Alice to lower her price:** She might be willing to come down closer to $800,000 to make a sale.
* **Buy from John as a last resort:** You still have the option to buy from John at $1,200,000, but it's best to try for a better deal from Alice first."
