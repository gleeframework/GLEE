Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of a good strategy for Alice, followed by the offer:

**Strategy:**

* **Understanding Bob's Position:** Bob sees the product as worth $800,000. This means any price above that will likely be rejected.
* **Leveraging John:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $800,000 from John. This forms her ""safety net.""
* **Aiming High, Reasonably:**  Alice should start with an offer slightly below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for a counter-offer if Bob wants to negotiate.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $780,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer that reflects the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 780000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Message:**  It's polite, professional, and highlights the product's value without being overly aggressive.
* **The Price:** $780,000 is just below Bob's perceived value. This gives him a small incentive to accept immediately while still leaving Alice room to potentially earn more if Bob counter-offers. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Alice's bottom line is $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Time Sensitivity:**  While not explicitly stated, implying a degree of time sensitivity can sometimes encourage a quicker decision from Bob."
