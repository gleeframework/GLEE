"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can offer the product to you for $102.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",102.5,Alice,5,
