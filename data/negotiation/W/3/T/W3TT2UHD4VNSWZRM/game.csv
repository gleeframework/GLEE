"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $18000?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $22000 for the product. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $22000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $19500?",19500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $20500 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if this is something you're willing to accept.",20500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're willing to meet me at a price that's closer to my minimum. I can offer you a price of $19250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",19250.0,Alice,7,
