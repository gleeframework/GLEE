Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $18000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer of $18,000 is lower than my initial offer, but higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($15,000), I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

Bob's offer:

However, I should also consider the fact that Bob has been making a good-faith effort to negotiate, and his offer is still a significant amount higher than the minimum price. I'll try to find a compromise.

However, I've made three concessions already, and Bob is still not willing to meet me at a price that's close to my minimum. I'm starting to think that Bob's maximum willingness to pay is lower than my minimum price, and it's not worth continuing the negotiation further.
