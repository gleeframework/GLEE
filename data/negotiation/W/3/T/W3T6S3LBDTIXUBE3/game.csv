"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price, given its value to you.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,000,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 is still below what I need to consider.  How about $1,025,000? This would be a good compromise and allow us to both come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,025,000, so how about $987,500? That's the highest I can go.",987500.0,Bob,6,
