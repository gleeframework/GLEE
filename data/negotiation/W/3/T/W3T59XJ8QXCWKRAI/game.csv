"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $13000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're holding firm on the price.  I'm willing to go up to $13250, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to accept.",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13250 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $13750, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know your decision.",13750.0,Alice,5,
