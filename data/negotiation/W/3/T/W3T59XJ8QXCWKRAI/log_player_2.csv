"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's $12,000 limit.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  $13,500 is closer to his goal of $12,000, but he can still try to get a better deal. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're holding firm on the price.  I'm willing to go up to $13,250, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13250 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $13750, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting close to his limit.  $13,750 is only $750 away from his $13,000 maximum, but it's still a bit too high for him to be comfortable with. It's better to secure the product from John at his known price of $12,000 to avoid risking going further over budget in the negotiation."
