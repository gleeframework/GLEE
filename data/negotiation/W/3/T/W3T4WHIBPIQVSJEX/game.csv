"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $600,000 range.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $900,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $725,000?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference?  I'll come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's still well within your budget.  Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $780,000? That's a strong offer, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $780,000 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm committed to reaching an agreement, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $820,000. This price is fair to both of us, and we can finally move forward with this deal.",820000.0,Alice,7,
