"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be highly valuable to you.  Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from what it's worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a good profit.  It's also important to be confident and highlight the value of the product to make a strong first impression."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $600,000 range.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I need to be flexible, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer this early in the negotiation. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $900,000. This is still a good profit for me and a significant savings for Bob compared to my initial offer.  I'm also trying to build rapport by acknowledging his offer and emphasizing that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $900,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $725,000?  That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is coming closer to my minimum acceptable price, $725,000 is still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my bottom line in the next round. I'm still aiming for a sale with Bob, but I'm also aware that I could sell to John for $1,000,000 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference?  I'll come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's still well within your budget.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm proposing $850,000, which is the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still maintaining a price that's closer to my bottom line. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer and the potential to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $780,000? That's a strong offer, and I'm eager to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $780,000 is getting closer to my bottom line, I still have a few rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $800,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'm aware I can sell to John for $1,000,000 if this deal falls through, so I have a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $780,000 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm committed to reaching an agreement, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $820,000. This price is fair to both of us, and we can finally move forward with this deal."", ""product_price"": 820000}
```

I'm offering $820,000, which is the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm serious about reaching a deal and willing to compromise further. By emphasizing the fairness of the offer and the need to move forward, I'm hoping to convince Bob to accept."
