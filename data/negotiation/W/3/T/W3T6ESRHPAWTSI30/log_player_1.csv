Round 2
Bob's offer:

I will reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $95."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer.  While $87.50 is better than selling to John, I believe we can still negotiate a bit higher.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $90."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $89 is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it! Let me know if you're in."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence! I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to try to meet you in the middle again. Would you be willing to do $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're getting very close to my target price, and with only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  $88 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $80."
