"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $14,000 is very close to your maximum budget and leaves very little room for negotiation. 
* **You have a fallback option:** You know John will sell you the product for $15,000. This gives you leverage.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for her to potentially lower the price. It also signals that you are a serious buyer but not willing to overpay."
