"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product to you, and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $920,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $940,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that will allow us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this happen!",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $940,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $930,000 for the product, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I hope we can come to an agreement.",930000.0,Bob,6,
