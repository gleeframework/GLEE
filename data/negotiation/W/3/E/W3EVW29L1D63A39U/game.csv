"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, considering its value to me is significantly higher. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $130 is still quite a bit below what I'm willing to accept. How about we split the difference and go with $135? This would allow me to make a decent profit and you would still get a good deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've considered your last offer, but I'm still looking for something closer to my budget. Would you be open to selling the product for $128?",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $128 is just a little too low for me. How about $132? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. Considering my budget, I'd like to propose $129 as the final price for the product.",129.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to reaching a final agreement.  $129 is still a bit below my desired price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $131.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally finalize this deal. Let me know if you're interested.",131.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're closing in on a price that works for both of us. Considering your last offer, I'd like to propose $130 as the final price for the product.",130.0,Bob,8,
