Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,100,000? This is still a fantastic price for you, considering your estimated value, and allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but I was thinking we could meet at $1,025,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get to $1,050,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I think I can do better than that. How about we try $975,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is too low, and with only 2 rounds left, I'm not confident I can get him to come up to a more acceptable price.  Selling to John at $800,000 is the best option at this point."
