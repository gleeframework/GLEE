"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your initial asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $8,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $8,250 for the product. Can you consider that?",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm glad you're willing to increase your offer. I'm still a bit short of my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'll accept $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell the product for. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,7,
