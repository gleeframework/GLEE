{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It is above your minimum price of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation as it is below Bob's perceived value of $15,000. This approach helps you potentially secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,000? This would still leave room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
