"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 110}
