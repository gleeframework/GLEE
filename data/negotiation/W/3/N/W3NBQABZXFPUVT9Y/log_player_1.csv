Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob without immediately needing to involve John.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the deal being good, encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product is valued at $12000 to you, but I'm only able to pay up to $8000. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold:** I'm unwilling to sell the product for less than $12,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** Although Bob's offer is low, it signifies his interest. There's potential to negotiate a better price.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me leverage to negotiate with Bob without settling for his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. My minimum price for the product is $11,000. It's a fair compromise considering its value to me and your interest in acquiring it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within range:**  $11,000 is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining leverage:** This counter-offer is still above Bob's perceived value but signals flexibility. 
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the fairness of the compromise, encouraging further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand your position, I'm still unable to meet your asking price. I'm willing to pay up to $9000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $9,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $12,000.
* **Potential for higher offer:** While Bob's offer is closer, there's still potential for him to increase his offer. 
* **John's offer remains the best:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation. 

However, I'll counter-offer Bob one more time before considering John's offer.  I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. However,  $10,000 is my final offer. This price reflects both the value of the product to me and your expressed interest in acquiring it.  Let me know if you're willing to meet this price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This counter-offer sets a clear boundary, making it clear that I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Moderate compromise:** $10,000 is still above Bob's latest offer but significantly lower than my initial offer, indicating flexibility.
* **Emphasis on value and interest:**  The message highlights the value of the product and Bob's desire to purchase it, subtly pressuring him to consider the offer. 

After this offer, I'll be ready to accept John's offer if Bob rejects my final offer."
