{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point.  It's higher than my minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a bit more.  If he rejects, we can continue to negotiate.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup offer just in case."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500. Can we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to my desired price, and it's still a good deal for both of us.  I'm happy to accept it and move forward with the sale."
