"I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $110. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. This is a fair price, and I hope you'll consider it.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $110, so I'm offering the product to you for $97.50. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope you'll consider it.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $97.50 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to stick with my offer of $85, and I hope you'll reconsider. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",85.0,Bob,6,
