Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $140 is a bit above my budget. How about $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
