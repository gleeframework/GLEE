"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is unique and valuable, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price reflects the value of the product while still giving you a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,180,000 is still too far off for me.  This product is truly special and offers immense value.  Let's compromise at $1,225,000.  It's a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and your budget.  Let me know what you think.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
