"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,180,000. This takes into account your needs and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1180000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,180,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,160,000?",1160000.0,Bob,4,
