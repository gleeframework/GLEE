"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, but I need to make a profit. Would you be open to discussing this price point?",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to keep your budget in check, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $6000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last discussion, so I'm offering the product to you for $7000. This is my final compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",7000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I've already stretched my budget as far as I can. I'm willing to go up to $6500, but that's the absolute maximum I can afford. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",6500.0,Bob,6,
