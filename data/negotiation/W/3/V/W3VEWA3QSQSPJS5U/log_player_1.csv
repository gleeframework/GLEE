Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent starting point, as it's above my minimum acceptable value of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  Let's see if he's willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy to get my minimum value for the product, I think I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter Bob with $135. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's. It shows I'm flexible but still trying to get a decent price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge. It seems like we've reached an impasse, and I'm not willing to continue this negotiation. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for my minimum value of $120."
