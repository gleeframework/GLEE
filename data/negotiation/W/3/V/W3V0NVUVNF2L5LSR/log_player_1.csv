"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a good price, so I'm starting at $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being above Bob's perceived value.
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and highlighting the value of the product to Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages a positive response.
* **Room for negotiation:**  $14,000 is a starting point, and I'm ready to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** I value the product at $15,000, and Bob's offer is still below that. 
* **More negotiation room:**  While I'd like to close the deal, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.
* **Exploring options:** I'm not immediately jumping to selling to John, as I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay a bit closer to my asking price. How about $13,500? It's a fair price that's still a good value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my last offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,000). 
* **Maintaining a reasonable profit:**  This price still allows me to make a decent profit while being more appealing to Bob than my previous offer. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm trying to keep the conversation positive and focused on finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $13,250. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer to my minimum:**  While $13,250 is still below my ideal price of $15,000, it's getting closer to my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that if I reject this offer, Bob might lower his offer even further or become unwilling to negotiate. 
* **Closing the deal:** This is a good opportunity to secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal completely.

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to close the deal and avoid further negotiation risks."
