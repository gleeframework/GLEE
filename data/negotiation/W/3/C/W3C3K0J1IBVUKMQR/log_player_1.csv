Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $12,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but I am still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on a price of $16,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good business decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  $16,000 is a significant profit margin over my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal quickly frees me up to pursue other opportunities instead of potentially lengthy negotiations."
