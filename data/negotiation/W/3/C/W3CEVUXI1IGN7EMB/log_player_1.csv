Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he feels the price is too steep. 
* **Alternative in Mind:**  We know our safety net is John at $800,000. Offering it to Bob for $1,100,000 allows for a significant profit margin while still being attractive to Bob compared to losing the deal.

This approach aims for a win-win: Bob gets the product he values, and Alice maximizes her profit beyond her guaranteed sale price."
