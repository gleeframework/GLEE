"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, I can potentially get a better price. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,600? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about $8,600. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done my research, and I believe that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. 

Even though I'd prefer to get a higher price, it seems Bob is set on his $8,000 offer.  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's not likely that I can get a better price from him.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and saves me time."
