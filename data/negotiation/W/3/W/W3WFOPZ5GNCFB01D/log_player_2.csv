Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a middle ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's close this deal.

Alice is definitely willing to come down, and we're getting close to a price that works for us.  It's worth one more counteroffer to try to get a bit closer to $750,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair offer, and I appreciate you working with me.  To make this work, I could stretch my budget to $750,000.  I believe that's a very competitive offer, and it would allow us to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 750000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $760,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll see it as a great opportunity. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $760,000

Alice has come down considerably, and at $760,000, the offer is within a reasonable range of John's price. Continuing to negotiate for a smaller difference might not be worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
