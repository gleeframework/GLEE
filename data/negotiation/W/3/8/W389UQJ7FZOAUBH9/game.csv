"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the true value of the product and gives you a great deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $1,500,000?  This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it still leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's close this deal!",1500000.0,Alice,5,
