Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name].  Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($2,000,000 vs. $1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This may make Bob perceive a price closer to $1,500,000 as more reasonable.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's ""immense value"" and ""unique opportunity,"" subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, providing a safety net if Bob rejects the initial offer.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to negotiate.  You have room to come down in price while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Product Knowledge:** Adjust the ""value"" language in the message to accurately reflect your product's unique selling points."
