Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $950000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1000000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  I'm confident this is the best possible price we can reach.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.
