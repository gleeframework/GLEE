"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to your limit than Alice's initial value, you can still try to negotiate a better price. You're better off rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, potentially getting a price closer to your desired $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a significant discount from Alice's initial price, making it a reasonable starting point for further negotiation. It also leaves room for potential compromise, as you're still willing to pay more than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to your maximum limit, but it's still above your desired price. At this point, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price is outweighed by the certainty of getting the product for your target price from John.  While you might be able to get a slightly better deal with Alice, the time and uncertainty involved aren't worth the potential savings."
