# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is inflated:** Alice claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, but you know your maximum valuation is $1,500,000.  Her attempt to inflate the perceived value is a negotiation tactic.
* **John provides a fallback:**  You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $1,500,000. This gives you leverage to negotiate with Alice. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay an inflated price. She may come back with a lower offer closer to her $800,000 valuation.

**Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, you're aiming to get Alice to reveal more of her hand and potentially secure a price closer to $1,000,000 or lower."
