"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to sell you this great product! I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Reason: Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. You should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it."", ""product_price"": 60}

Reason:Starting with a significantly lower offer  gives you room to negotiate upwards while staying well below your maximum budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $60 and $150, so I'm offering the product to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Reason: While Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, $105 is still over your budget.  You should continue negotiating and see if you can get closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $75? That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 75}

Reason: We are increasing our offer to show willingness to negotiate, but staying firmly below $80. This keeps the pressure on Alice while leaving us the option to go with John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $75, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you the product for $110, which is closer to my minimum price of $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Reason: Alice is not budging much from her last offer, and it seems unlikely she'll go below $100. Buying from John at $80 saves you money and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiation."
