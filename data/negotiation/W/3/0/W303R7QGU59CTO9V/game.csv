"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $60 and $150, so I'm offering the product to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $75, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you the product for $110, which is closer to my minimum price of $120.",110.0,Alice,5,
