Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000).
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I want to create space for Bob to counter-offer and potentially find a price we both agree on.
* **Maintaining flexibility:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer again, keeping in mind my goal of maximizing my earnings.
* **John as a safety net:** Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I want to continue the negotiation, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Potential for compromise:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows interest, and I believe there's still room for compromise.
* **John's offer remains a fallback:** I can still sell to John for $10,000 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a fair price for the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counter-offer is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Appeal to fairness:** I emphasize the value of the product to justify the price, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Positive language:** Using positive language (""feel good about the deal"") helps create a more amicable negotiation environment.
* **Still above minimum:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I'm confident that the product will be worth it to me, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum, but still below:**  While $8,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will continue to lower his offer, potentially pushing me further below my minimum.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Time is a factor:**  While I could continue negotiating, John's offer provides a quick and certain solution."
