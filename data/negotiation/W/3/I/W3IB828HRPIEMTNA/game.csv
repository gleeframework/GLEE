"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $11500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $10750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $12000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
