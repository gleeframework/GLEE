Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $90. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about $110? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to meet my target price of $80. She's come down a bit, but her latest offer of $110 is still significantly higher.  Rather than continuing to negotiate and potentially waste more rounds, it's more strategic to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed price of $80."
