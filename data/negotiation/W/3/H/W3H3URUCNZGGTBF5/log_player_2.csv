# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $14,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm really only able to go up to $15,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your maximum offer is $15000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my initial offer. I'm willing to give you a small discount from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I get a good price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $15,000. You've made multiple counteroffers and it seems Alice is unwilling to go lower.  Since John is offering the product for your maximum budget, it's more efficient to purchase from John rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice.  You're guaranteed to get the product within your budget and save time."
