"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $14000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,2,
