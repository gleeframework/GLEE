Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's appealing to Bob while maximizing your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can be a bit bolder.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** We start closer to your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle).
* **Value-Focused Message:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price, rather than focusing solely on numbers.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower (but above $1,500,000) to give yourself more wiggle room.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you need to sell quickly, a slightly lower price might be more attractive to Bob.
