"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you.  I know it's worth at least $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm getting a good price and you're getting a product that you value highly.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than the $12,000 she values the product at, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and buying from John for $8,000 is the most financially advantageous choice."
