"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This tactic:

* **Tests Alice's flexibility:** It helps me understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, there's space to meet in the middle.
* **Aims for a good deal:** My goal is to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I can do a bit better than that, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is now matching John's price. There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation as I won't get a better price elsewhere."
