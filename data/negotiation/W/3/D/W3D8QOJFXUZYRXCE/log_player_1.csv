I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway from his last offer, but still securing a profit for me.  I'm hoping this will be agreeable enough for him to accept."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob is getting too low for me to consider continuing. With only 4 rounds remaining, there's a high risk that the negotiations will stall, and I'm not confident I can get a better price.  Selling to John guarantees me a $1,000,000 profit, which is still a significant amount."
