"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I think it's a great price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $7,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,500 is a good price for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's offer of $12,000, and it's closer to Bob's desired price range. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save a substantial amount of money while still acquiring the product."
