"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,400,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too much for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,350,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to budge much further. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $1,325,000. I believe this is the best compromise we can reach, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a way to meet in the middle.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
