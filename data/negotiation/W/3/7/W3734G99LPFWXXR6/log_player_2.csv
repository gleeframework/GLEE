"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe this product has immense value to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm starting with an offer of $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum price. It's worth exploring if I can get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,400,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $1,300,000 is still too high. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm still within my budget, and there's no rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too much for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,350,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to budge much further. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $1,325,000. I believe this is the best compromise we can reach, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,325,000 is still higher than my ideal price, it's getting closer to my maximum.  We're nearing the halfway point in our negotiations, and there's a risk that if I continue to reject, Alice might become less willing to negotiate. It's better to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with than risk losing the deal completely and having to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
