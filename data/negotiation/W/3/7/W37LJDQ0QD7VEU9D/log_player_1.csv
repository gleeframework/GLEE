Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This is a starting point that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob while leaving room for him to make a counteroffer. 

By starting with a higher price, I can potentially secure a better deal. However, I'm aware that I can always fall back on selling to John for $800,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired value and what I initially offered. Rejecting the offer allows me to:

* **Negotiate further:** I can counteroffer with a price closer to my ideal price point ($950,000) or somewhere in between.
* **Test Bob's commitment:**  By rejecting, I can gauge how much he truly wants the product. 
* **Maintain leverage:** If I accept, I might be missing out on a better deal. By rejecting, I keep the negotiation going and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and it's a price that reflects the unique benefits of this product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This is a compromise, significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still keeping a decent profit margin.
* **Message:** The message is positive and focuses on finding a middle ground. I reiterate the value to Bob and highlight the unique aspects of the product to justify the price. 

By making a counteroffer, I'm pushing for a better deal while remaining open to negotiation. This keeps the conversation going and allows me to gauge Bob's commitment to the purchase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $875000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is a significant improvement from his initial $850,000 offer.  It's now only $25,000 less than my initial offer and a significant jump from John's $800,000 offer. 

Considering the potential for further negotiation to be lengthy and uncertain, accepting Bob's offer at $875,000 seems like the most pragmatic decision.  It secures a good profit while minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potential delays."
