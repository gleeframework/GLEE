"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,800,000 is far beyond my budget. Given the value you've placed on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering it matches your own valuation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While your offer is generous, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return on this investment.  How about we meet halfway at $1,400,000? This reflects the product's true worth and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To demonstrate my genuine interest in this product, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000.  This is a significant step towards meeting your needs, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000? This price reflects the product's potential while still providing a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still not quite there. While I understand the product's value, I'm committed to staying within my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  This is a substantial offer that represents a significant compromise on my part.  Let's try to bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
