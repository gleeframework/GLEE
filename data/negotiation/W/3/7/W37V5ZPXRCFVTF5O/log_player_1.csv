I'm offering Bob the product for $1,150,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant discount from my minimum price of $1,200,000 but still leaves me with a comfortable profit margin.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate further.  There's a good chance that Bob will eventually come up to a more agreeable price, especially since he values the product at $1,000,000."

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it's the minimum amount I'm willing to accept.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this offer, especially since he values the product at this price. If he rejects this offer, I'll be happy to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

Bob is clearly unwilling to pay my minimum price, even with it being the value he assigns to the product.  I'm better off selling to John and guaranteeing my desired profit."
