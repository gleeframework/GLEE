Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Potential Profit:**  There's a potential profit to be made if you can sell to Bob for more than $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob (below his maximum valuation) while still maximizing your profit. Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of urgency and desirability.
* **Value Focus:** ""Unique value proposition"" subtly reinforces the product's worth without explicitly mentioning Bob's maximum.
* **Strong Price Point:** $1,350,000 is a significant discount for Bob (saving him $150,000), making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Time Pressure:** ""Limited-time offer"" and mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of scarcity, encouraging a quicker decision.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust if Bob counters or hesitates.  You hold the advantage with John's offer, so don't be afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffer is too low."
