"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $700,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this exceptional product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $825,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $762,500?",762500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $795,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close, and I appreciate the concessions you've made.  To be honest, anything much above $780,000 is going to be a tough sell for me.  Would you be willing to come down just a bit more?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $785,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal!",785000.0,Alice,7,
