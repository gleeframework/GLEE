,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still well below what it's worth to you.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I've given it some thought and I'm willing to go up to $103 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for both of us.",103.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $103 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $104.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can reach a mutually agreeable outcome.",104.0,Alice,5,
