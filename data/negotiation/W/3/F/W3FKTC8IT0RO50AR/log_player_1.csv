Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message subtly implies its value by mentioning a ""public listing"". 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always come down in price, especially since your minimum acceptable price is $8,000."
