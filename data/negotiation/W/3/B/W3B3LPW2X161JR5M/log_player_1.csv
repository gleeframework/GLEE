Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still gives you a good profit. Let me know what you think.
