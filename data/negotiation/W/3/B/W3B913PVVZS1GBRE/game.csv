"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects the value I know it holds for your business.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth more than $900,000, but I still believe $1,000,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll propose $950,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.",950000.0,Bob,4,
