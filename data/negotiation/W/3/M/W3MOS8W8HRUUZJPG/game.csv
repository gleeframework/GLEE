"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is considerably below what I believe the product is worth. I could consider $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
