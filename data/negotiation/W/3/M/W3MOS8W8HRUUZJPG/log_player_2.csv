"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is a good deal, you can potentially do better.  You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to counter and potentially get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is considerably below what I believe the product is worth. I could consider $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from $1,300,000 to $1,150,000, which is a good sign. However, you still have room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your ideal, potentially securing a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
