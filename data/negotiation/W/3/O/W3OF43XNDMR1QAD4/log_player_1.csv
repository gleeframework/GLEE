Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is $20,000, it hints at the product's value.  
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning listing the product publicly, you subtly remind Bob that he might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, making Bob more likely to counter-offer rather than walk away immediately.

Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice still has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John. This strategy maximizes her potential profit."
