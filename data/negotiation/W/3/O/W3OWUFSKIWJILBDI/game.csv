"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,800,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway,  Let's try $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the true value of this product and allows us both to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,300,000. If you're serious about making this deal work, let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. $1,400,000 is a fair price that acknowledges your budget and still allows me to make a profit. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
