Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,800,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,300,000. If you're serious about making this deal work, let's find a middle ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $1,500,000. I'm confident I can secure a better price if I continue to negotiate with Bob."
