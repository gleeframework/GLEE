Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:**  While we have a backup buyer, aiming too low might discourage Bob and lead to an immediate rejection. 
 
This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
