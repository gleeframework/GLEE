"Alice, while I appreciate the value of your product, your price is quite a bit higher than what I'm able to pay. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This reflects the maximum I can reasonably afford while still finding it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I need to consider the product's value and rarity. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute maximum.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1200000. However, I still think the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1300000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's rarity and value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
