{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than the price from John, there is still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and is still above Alice's minimum selling price of $8,000.  This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to potentially save a considerable amount of money."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Although Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. He can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,000 for the product. This is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to negotiate, but still wants to save money. It's also likely to be acceptable to Alice as it is above her minimum selling price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,100 is only $100 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  At this point, the negotiation is getting close to the end, and continuing to reject offers could risk losing the product to another buyer, or being forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  By accepting, Bob saves $900 compared to buying from John, while still achieving a significant discount from Alice's initial price."
