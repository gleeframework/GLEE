Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $95 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $95 is less than what Bob values the product at ($100), leaving room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is direct and states the price clearly, avoiding confusion.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. It's a fair price that benefits us both. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $87.50 is still a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for less."
