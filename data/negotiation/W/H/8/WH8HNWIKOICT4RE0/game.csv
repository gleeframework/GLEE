"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $800000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we've discussed.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to consider a price of $870000, which is a 9% discount from my original offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",870000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $870000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $800000. Would you consider $830000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to get closer to your asking price while still being within my budget.",830000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to your budget. However, I'm not willing to go down to $830000. I'm willing to consider a price of $855000, which is a 5% discount from my original offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",855000.0,Alice,5,
