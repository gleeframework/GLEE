"Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you have a backup option (buying from John), there's no risk in rejecting Alice's offer and attempting to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Explanation:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price is a common negotiation tactic. It shows you're serious about getting a good deal and allows room for negotiation.  $500,000 is a substantial reduction from $750,000, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit if her true value is lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm still within my budget and can afford to continue negotiating.  There's a good chance I can get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate.  However, I'm still staying below Alice's last offer, leaving room for further compromise and signaling that I'm serious about getting the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $650,000 is still a good deal compared to John's offer, I'm not willing to give up yet.  The negotiation is moving in the right direction (Alice's offer is decreasing), and I believe I can still get a lower price.  The risk of losing the deal to another buyer isn't a concern here, as I have a guaranteed backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again to show that I'm serious about getting a deal and willing to meet Alice halfway.  $600,000 is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer, leaving room for compromise.  This also avoids a situation where we keep going back and forth with small increments."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $700,000 is getting closer to my initial counteroffer of $500,000, but it's still a good deal compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  At this point, further negotiation might take too long and risk losing the deal.  I'm confident that I can get the product at a good price with Alice's offer, so I'll accept it."
