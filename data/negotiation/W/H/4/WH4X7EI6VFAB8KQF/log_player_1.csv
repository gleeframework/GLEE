Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you at a price of $750,000.  I think it's a fair price that reflects the value it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value ($800,000) increases the chances of acceptance. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $750,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing Alice to still potentially gain more than John's offer.
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and positions the price as a fair deal, making it more likely for Bob to consider the offer seriously."
