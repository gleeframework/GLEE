Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within your budget, and it's a significant decrease from her initial offer. While you could potentially try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice might reject your counteroffer again, and you would end up buying from John for a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you acquire the product for a price you are comfortable with, minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
