Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,150,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's estimated value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer, but I'll also be keeping John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000.  This is a compromise, acknowledging that Bob is willing to pay more than $1,050,000, but it's still closer to my target. I'm hoping this will lead to a quick agreement."
