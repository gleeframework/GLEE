"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to your business. It's something I've carefully developed and I'm confident it could significantly boost your operations.  While I'm willing to let it go for less than its full market value, I'm asking for $1,200,000. This price reflects the significant value it holds, while also allowing for a fair margin for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
