{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $150, but I'm willing to negotiate. It's important to be flexible while still holding firm on my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more competitive. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, though. How about $130? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
I'm reducing my price a bit further to show good faith, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's close to my minimum. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $127.50? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to keep negotiating. It's better for me to sell to John for $150 and guarantee my minimum profit."
