I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for myself.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer of $8,000."

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still allows me to make a profit."
