"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This still represents a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $1250000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1350000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the concessions I've already made. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better price, Alice. However, I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1305000. This is the best I can do, and I hope it's acceptable to you.",1305000.0,Bob,6,
