"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the potential of this product.  However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than my target.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is substantial.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This feels like a fair price that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Let me know your thoughts.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
