"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I am only willing to pay up to $150 for it. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer, because I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll try to counteroffer him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175. That's still a great deal, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $160 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $160 is still above my minimum threshold and a good price.  It's better to take a good deal than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for less."
