"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is too high for me.  I could do $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than our max budget to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a low number first, we might influence Alice to consider lower prices than she might have otherwise.
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  We always have the option to buy from John for $80 if negotiations fail."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is too low for me.  How about $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice came down slightly, but $180 is still way above both our budget and John's offer.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  There's a significant gap between our offer and Alice's current price, suggesting we have room to negotiate further. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** We're not desperate yet, as we can always fall back on buying from John at $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a better price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:**  We're moving significantly closer to her price, showing we're willing to compromise.
* **Still Below Budget:**  Our offer is still comfortably below our $80 maximum.
* **Middle Ground Tactic:**  By suggesting we ""meet in the middle"", we aim to anchor the negotiation closer to a price we find acceptable."
