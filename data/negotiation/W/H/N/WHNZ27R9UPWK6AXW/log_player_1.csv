""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and allows you to reap significant benefit."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  Our goal is to get as close to this figure as possible while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net of John who will buy the product for $1,000,000. This forms our minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves a significant profit margin for Bob ($150,000). This makes the deal very attractive to him while still securing a substantial profit ($350,000) for us.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" Framing:** By presenting this as a special opportunity tailored for Bob, we add perceived value and urgency, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
