"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're on a budget, but $65 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  I'm confident you'll find this a good deal for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $75 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $80?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80

At this point, Alice's offer matches John's price, so it makes sense to accept and avoid potentially missing out on the product altogether."
