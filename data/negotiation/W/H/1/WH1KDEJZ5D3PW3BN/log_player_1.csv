"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, it's worth at least $100 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and still secure a profit.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  I'm not going to start at $100 because I want to give Bob a sense that there's some flexibility in the price. 
* **Positive and friendly:** My message is positive and friendly, aiming to build a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Even though Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, his message indicates he's interested in the product and open to negotiation. This makes it worthwhile to try and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If the negotiation falls apart, I have the security of selling to John for $100, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're on a budget, but $65 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  I'm confident you'll find this a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum ($100) and Bob's offer ($65). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm still using a friendly tone, highlighting the value of the product and framing the offer as a good deal for both of us. 
* **Leaving some room:**  $85 is still above Bob's offer, which allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about $75?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to make the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 I need to make it worthwhile.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I'm still confident that with further negotiation, I can get a price closer to my target.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer because I can always sell to John for $100 if this negotiation falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $75 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $80?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above my minimum:**  $80 is still above my minimum of $100, but it shows a willingness to come down further from my previous offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, suggesting that the price is fair considering its worth.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  I'm using a positive tone and encouraging Bob to make the deal, hoping to build a sense of urgency and get a quick agreement."
