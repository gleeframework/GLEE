"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is far above your maximum valuation. You should definitely negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally good practice to start negotiations significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and still potentially secure a great deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $800,000, you signal flexibility while still aiming for a price well below both Alice's asking price and your maximum budget. 
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help gauge how much Alice is willing to negotiate. If she completely rejects this price, it might indicate a tougher negotiation ahead."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but the price is still above your maximum budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can push the price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price.  To be frank, $1,400,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we aim for $1,000,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:**  Alice's counteroffer indicates willingness to negotiate. Continuing the process is sensible.
* **Strategic Counter:**  Moving to $1,000,000 maintains a downward pressure on the price while also making a significant jump towards Alice's last offer. This shows flexibility on your part while still aiming for a good deal. 
* **Staying Below Budget:**  Importantly, this counteroffer keeps you below your $1,200,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate us trying to find common ground. While I'm motivated to sell, I need to be realistic about the product's worth. Would you be willing to consider $1,200,000? This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has matched your maximum budget, and she's stated this is her final offer. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price. You could buy from John for the same amount, but you've already invested time in this negotiation with Alice. It makes sense to accept her offer."
