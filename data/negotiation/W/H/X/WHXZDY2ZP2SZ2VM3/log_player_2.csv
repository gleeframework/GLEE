"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful.  I'm asking for $175 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I know I can get it for $150 from John, so I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($110) than Alice's asking price ($175). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** My message is polite and avoids being confrontational. I want to maintain a positive tone to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Goal:** My ultimate goal is to pay closer to John's price ($150). By starting low, I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle, ideally saving a significant amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's counteroffer of $135 is closer to a reasonable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to meet her somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice. How about we settle on $120? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's directly in between my previous offer ($110) and Alice's counteroffer ($135). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Firm:** While I'm flexible, I'm not immediately jumping to her $135. My goal is still to secure the best possible deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a polite and amicable tone to keep the negotiation moving forward smoothly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $120 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $125. This is a good price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is down to $125, which is a good deal compared to John's $150. It's unlikely I'll get her much lower, and I'd rather secure the product now than risk further negotiation."
