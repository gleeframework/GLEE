Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that should be more acceptable to you, while still allowing me to get a fair price for the product.

Alice's offer is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay closer to $1,000,000, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
