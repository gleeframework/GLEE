"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique and high-quality item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $775,000? That's a significant step closer to your price, and it would allow me to make the purchase while staying within my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $775,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. Let's try $825,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests, and I think you'll find it a great deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
