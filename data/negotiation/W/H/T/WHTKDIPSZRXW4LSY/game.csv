"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a discounted rate. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,
