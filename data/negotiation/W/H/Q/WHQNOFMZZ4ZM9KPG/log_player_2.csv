"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that could potentially increase your business profits significantly. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested.  If not, I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing:** Her statement about another buyer at $800,000 is likely a tactic to pressure you. It's improbable she'd risk losing a sale to you at $1,000,000 if she has a guaranteed buyer at $800,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This might prompt Alice to lower her price.
* **Backup option:** You have John as a backup willing to sell at $1,200,000. While not ideal, it's a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, you open the door for negotiation and potentially a better price from Alice, while still having the security of buying from John if needed."
