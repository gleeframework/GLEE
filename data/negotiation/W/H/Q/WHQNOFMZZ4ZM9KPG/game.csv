"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that could potentially increase your business profits significantly. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested.  If not, I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay $800,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
