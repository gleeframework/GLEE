"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend no more than $1,000,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget of $1,000,000. However, I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that should satisfy both of our needs. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
