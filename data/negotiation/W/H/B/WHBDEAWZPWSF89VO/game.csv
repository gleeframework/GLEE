"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. While I can't go as low as $8500, I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let's make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8750.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway once more. $8750 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to drop the price to $9250. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and your budget. Let's finalize this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
