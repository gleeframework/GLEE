"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $20,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm comfortable offering $14,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
