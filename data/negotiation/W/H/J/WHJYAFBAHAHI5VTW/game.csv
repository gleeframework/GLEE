"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. How about $1050000?  This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

I'm not comfortable with $1050000. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $950000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.,950000.0,Bob,4,
