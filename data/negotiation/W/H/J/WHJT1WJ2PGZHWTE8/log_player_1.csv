"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest.  $7500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $8500? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $8000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's a good deal for both of us."
