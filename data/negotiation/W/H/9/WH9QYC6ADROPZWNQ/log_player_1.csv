Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and potential ROI justifies the high asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" and ""Let me know your thoughts"" signals to Bob that you're open to discussing the price further. 

By starting high and being open to negotiation, you increase the chances of securing a deal significantly above your minimum acceptable price."
