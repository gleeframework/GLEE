"Bob, I believe this product has tremendous value for you, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This price reflects the product's potential and allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but allows me to make a more reasonable profit. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This would still leave you with a substantial profit while allowing me to secure a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,300,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,250,000? I think this price still reflects the product's value, and I'd be willing to make a deal at this point.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
