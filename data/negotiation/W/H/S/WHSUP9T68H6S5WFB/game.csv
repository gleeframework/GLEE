"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. Is that something you'd consider?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a little more, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. How about $10,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
