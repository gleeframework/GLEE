Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay.  I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.  $10,000 is well below my minimum price of $12,000.  While I could sell to John for $12,000, I'm hoping to get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum price of $12,000, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and I'm willing to take it.  While I could try for a higher price, there's always the risk that Bob will walk away, or that I'll have to lower my price even further.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale."
