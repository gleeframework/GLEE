Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we both see the value in this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $9,000 for it. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is holding firm at $9,000 and has labeled it her ""final offer.""  It's unlikely she'll go much lower. Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it's in your best interest to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal with John."
