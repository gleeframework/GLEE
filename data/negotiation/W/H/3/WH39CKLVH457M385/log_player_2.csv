"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $10,000. The product is worth $12,000 to him, so he has room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price lower than $10,000, and $9,500 is a reasonable starting point. It leaves some room for negotiation but still shows Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9800.  Let's split the difference and close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,800, which is still a good deal for Bob.  He's getting the product for $200 less than his initial offer and only $200 more than his counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal or having Alice raise the price again. Accepting the offer is the best option to ensure Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
