"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Given the product's value to me is $8000, I'd be willing to go up to $8500.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I would like to propose a price of $9000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our respective positions.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to come down to $8750? This would be a win-win, as it's still above your product's worth and below my maximum.",8750.0,Bob,4,
