"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $600,000. Can you consider this offer?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $600,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move closer to your number if you're willing to do the same. How about we settle on $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $725,000. Can you consider this offer?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to accept $800,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer at this price point.  Let me know if you're interested.",800000.0,Alice,5,
