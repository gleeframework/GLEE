{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $850,000 is higher than your minimum of $800,000, meaning you'll still make a profit.
* **It's within Bob's range:** Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This initial offer allows for some back-and-forth, giving you the chance to potentially secure a higher price. 

Remember, you can always counter-offer if Bob rejects your initial offer, and you can also choose to stop negotiating and sell to John at any time."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum. While I could accept it, I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation.  I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to consider."

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I'm not far off from my desired price of $825,000, and I believe I can still secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'll make one more counteroffer, then I'll seriously consider selling to John if Bob doesn't budge."
