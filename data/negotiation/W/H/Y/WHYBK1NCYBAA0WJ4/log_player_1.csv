"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting high, at $17,000. This is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I'll need to lower my price, but I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum value.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm offering $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for Bob, considering his own perceived value. I hope he accepts, but if not, I'm prepared to take the $15,000 from John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little further.  I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary, but I'm not going to give up on Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $14,000. This is a compromise, but I still believe it's a fair price considering both our perceived values. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a good deal for him, but I'm prepared to sell to John if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is still below my ideal price, I've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to result in a better offer from Bob. I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid any further risk."
