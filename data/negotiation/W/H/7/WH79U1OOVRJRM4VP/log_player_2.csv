"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,400,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  While John's offer is higher, it provides a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening counter:**  Starting with a lower offer ($1,250,000) puts pressure on Alice to negotiate.
* **Focus on budget:**  Mentioning your budget (""above my budget"") emphasizes your seriousness about buying but also sets a clear limit.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message conveys willingness to compromise (""find common ground""), suggesting a potential for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is a significant way off from my initial asking price. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's closer to your budget, $1,325,000 is still above your preferred price range. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and there's a good chance Alice will come down further.
* **John's offer is a backup:** Remember, you can always buy from John if negotiations with Alice fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,325,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go to $1,300,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:**  $1,300,000 is a compromise, showing you're willing to meet Alice halfway. 
* **Highlight fairness:** Emphasize ""fair price"" and ""closer to a deal"" to encourage Alice to see the value in a quick agreement.
* **Keep pressure on:**  By offering a slightly lower price, you maintain some negotiation leverage."
