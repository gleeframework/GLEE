"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is a significant way off from my initial asking price. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,325,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go to $1,300,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value and gets us closer to a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
