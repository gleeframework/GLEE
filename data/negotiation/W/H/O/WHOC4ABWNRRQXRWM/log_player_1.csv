{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, but it's also not excessively high. It leaves room for negotiation and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer. This gives me a chance to assess his interest and potentially reach a price we both agree on. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John for a guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a counter-offer at $105. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's budget while ensuring I get at least my minimum price. It also keeps the negotiation alive and shows my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below my desired price point. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. There's still a possibility we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $100. This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see its value. Would you be willing to meet me at $100? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm sticking to my minimum price of $100. This is a firm offer, but I'm still trying to be accommodating by offering a fair deal. It's the last chance for Bob to buy the product from me.  If he rejects, I'll sell it to John for the guaranteed $100."
