Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $875000. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $885000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is significantly closer to Bob's maximum value of $800,000.  While there's still room for negotiation, the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially going over Bob's budget or running out of rounds is high.  Accepting the offer at $885,000  allows Bob to acquire the product while staying within his budget and avoiding the risk of missing out on the deal."
