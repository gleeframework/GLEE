"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe will be of great benefit to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
