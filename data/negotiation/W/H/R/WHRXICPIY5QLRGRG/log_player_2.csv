"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price well below its worth to you.  I'm confident this product will be highly beneficial for your operations. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable asset. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000? This price still allows you to acquire the product at a significant discount while also providing me with a reasonable profit. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.
