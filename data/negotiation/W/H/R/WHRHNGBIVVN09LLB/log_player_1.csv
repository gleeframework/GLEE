"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with him.  I'm not going to sell to John yet, as that's my absolute minimum and I'm hoping to do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $9,000?  This is a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more.  I'm not going to sell to John yet, as that's my absolute minimum and I'm hoping to do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $8,750 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,875?  It's a fair price, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750 again?

It's getting frustrating! Bob isn't budging much and I'm running out of rounds. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I wanted to get closer to my ideal price, $8,000 is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk losing any more time or money with Bob."
