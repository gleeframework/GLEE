"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1000000.  Let's start the negotiation off strong!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1550000. This price still leaves room for profit for you, and it gets me closer to my desired value. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1550000 is still a bit above my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $1350000? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my desired price, but $1350000 is still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more. Let's try $1450000.  This gives us both a bit of room to breathe and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still think we can do better. How about we try $1300000? I'm willing to make a bit of a sacrifice to get this deal done, but I don't want to go too far above my target.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This is a good compromise, and it's getting closer to where we both need to be. I'm confident we can seal the deal if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we try $1250000? I'm willing to make a bit of a sacrifice to get this deal done, but I don't want to go too far above my target.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
