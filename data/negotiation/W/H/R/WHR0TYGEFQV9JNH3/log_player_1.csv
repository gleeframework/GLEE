I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I believe Bob is likely to find this price attractive given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,650,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's initial counteroffer, but still leaving a good margin for me. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer a bit more, I think it's a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation to be lengthy. I'm happy to accept this offer and move forward with the sale."
