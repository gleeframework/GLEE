"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11000? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. How about we try to find a price that's closer to my original offer? I'm willing to meet you at $11750. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",11750.0,Alice,5,
