Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum value ($1,000,000). 
* **Room for negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation without immediately pushing Bob away.
* **Positive language:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer, keeping in mind John's offer of $1,000,000. 
* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to spend no more than $800,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?  I believe it's a fair offer given the value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is a fair price for him, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have John's offer as a fallback option, so I can afford to be firm with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob, aiming to get a price closer to my minimum while still being competitive with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm unable to go as low as $800,000.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  Would you consider $850,000?  This price reflects the value of the product while still acknowledging your budget constraints.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:** My counter-offer of $850,000 is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $800,000. 
* **Emphasize compromise:** My message emphasizes that I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a price that's close to my minimum.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and collaborative, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next counteroffer.  If it's closer to my minimum, I might be willing to accept it. 
* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal,  but still higher than his initial offer.
* I will keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
