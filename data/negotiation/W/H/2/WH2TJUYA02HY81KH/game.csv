"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is my best price for now.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I was hoping we could meet at $12,000, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $12,000 to my minimum price of $15,000, so I'll offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final concession.",13500.0,Alice,7,
