"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product to me.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  This would still give you a good profit, and it's a price I can comfortably afford. Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true worth to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still a bit above my ideal price point.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $750,000.  I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $750,000, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a reasonable return on my investment. I'll offer it to you for $800,000. This is a serious compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to work with me. I understand the value of this product, and $800,000 is a significant step in the right direction. However, I'm still a bit over my budget. To make this work, I'm prepared to offer $775,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects both our needs. Let's try to close this deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that $775,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'll meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $787,500. This is a serious compromise, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think?",787500.0,Alice,7,
