"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm happy to consider this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product and would be a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still higher than I can go.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm firm on my previous offer of $800,000. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",800000.0,Bob,4,
