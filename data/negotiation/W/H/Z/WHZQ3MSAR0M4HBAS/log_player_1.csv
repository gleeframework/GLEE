"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm providing a reason for the price to make it sound more reasonable.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** I want to maximize my profit and cannot accept his offer. 
* **I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I'm not rushing into a deal that is significantly lower than my desired outcome.** I have time to explore other options and try to get closer to my price.
* **Selling to John is an option, but it's not the best outcome at this point.** I'm still trying to secure a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit lower than I can go at this point.  I'm willing to come down a little bit to $1,600,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also making a counter-offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** This is a good deal for me, as I'm earning my minimum desired profit. 
* **There's no guarantee that I can get a better offer in the remaining rounds.**  While I could try to push for a higher price, the risk of rejection and the time constraint make it less worthwhile. 
* **Selling to John is a safe option, but it doesn't offer any additional profit.** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a quick and satisfying deal."
