"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $9,500 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $8,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",8800.0,Alice,5,
