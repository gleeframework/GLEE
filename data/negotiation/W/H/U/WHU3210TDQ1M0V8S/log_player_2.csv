"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's best to see if Alice is willing to come down on her price significantly. Starting at $8,000 from John gives us a strong alternative if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but realistic starting point:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's important to start low and gauge her willingness to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  This offer allows for upward movement in subsequent rounds while still aiming for a price well below our $8,000 maximum. 
* **John as a backup:** We have the security of John's $8,000 offer if negotiations with Alice don't yield a favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $9,500 is still above our ideal price and what John is offering. We're getting closer, so it's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can get closer to the $8,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $9,500 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($9,500) and our previous offer ($6,000). 
* **Staying below John's price:** We're still aiming for a deal that's better than what John is offering.
* **Conveying seriousness:** By offering a specific price and framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" we're signaling to Alice that we're serious about making a deal but need her to move closer to our price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $8,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close enough to John's price:**  While not ideal, $8,800 is only slightly above John's offer of $8,000. 
* **""Lowest I'm willing to go"":**  Alice's language suggests she's unlikely to budge much further. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to push for a lower price might make Alice walk away, leaving us to settle for John's offer anyway. 

It's a judgment call, but accepting at $8,800 secures a decent price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
