"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is continuing to come down on price, but Bob is still $112,500 away from his desired price. Since Bob has 5 rounds left, he can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price. If he runs out of rounds, he can always buy from John for $1,200,000."
