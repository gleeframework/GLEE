"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly lower than your maximum but still leaves room for negotiation. You should counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a nice product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's a negotiation tactic to begin with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining and signals that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  By phrasing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" you maintain a sense of fairness and suggest a willingness to compromise.  
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer aims to bring the price down closer to your ideal range while still leaving Alice room to negotiate further."
