Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the value Bob will receive, reminding him of the $150 worth to him, making the offer more appealing.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message uses language like ""What do you say?"" to convey I'm open to discussion and a potential counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, always keeping my minimum price of $80 in mind.  If his counteroffer is too low, I'll either counter again or consider selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a nice product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's counteroffer of $100 is a significant step closer to my desired price range.  It's a reasonable compromise, especially considering my minimum selling price is $80.
* **Time is Money:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that I'll waste time in back-and-forth offers.  Accepting his offer secures a sale and a good profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential for getting a few more dollars by rejecting and counter-offering is outweighed by the risk of losing the sale entirely.  $100 is a good price, and I'd rather lock in the sale than chase a higher price that might not materialize."
