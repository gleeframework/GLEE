I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to get closer to that in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob $160. This is still a good deal for him, as it's $20 more than his initial offer, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
