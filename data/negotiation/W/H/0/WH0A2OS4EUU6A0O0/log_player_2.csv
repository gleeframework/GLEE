"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $900,000 is not a good option.  It's also too early to buy from John, as there's a chance to negotiate a better price with Alice. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still not ideal. There's a chance to negotiate a better price.  There are still enough rounds remaining to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $800,000 is his maximum price.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can buy the product from John for the same price. This offer gives Alice a clear picture of Bob's upper limit and puts the pressure on her to decide."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer of $825,000 is very close to Bob's maximum price of $800,000. It's worth accepting this offer and saving time and effort. There is a strong chance that further negotiation will not result in a lower price, and it's always a risk to reject an offer and potentially lose the deal."
