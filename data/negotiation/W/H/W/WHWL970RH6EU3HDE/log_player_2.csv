"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's far above my limit and even above her own valuation. It's important to bring the price down strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. This product would be worth $60 to me.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** Starting with a low counter-offer of $60 establishes a strong negotiating position. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it gives me room to negotiate upwards.
* **Transparent (to a degree):**  Telling Alice that the product is only worth $60 to me sets a lower bound for my side. This doesn't reveal my actual upper limit ($100) but gives her a point of reference.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The wording keeps the conversation going, making it clear that I'm interested but need a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. This product is high-quality and offers a lot of value.  How about we meet in the middle at $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $160 is still too high and above my budget. I need to show her I'm serious about a lower price point. It's too early to buy from John, as there's still room for negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Could you consider $80? I feel that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  I'm raising my offer to $80, showing Alice I'm willing to move but not dramatically.
* **Reiterating budget constraints:** By mentioning my budget again, I'm subtly reminding Alice that I have an upper limit and other options (John).
* **Seeking a fair deal:**  Framing the counteroffer as ""fair"" emphasizes that I'm looking for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that. While $80 is still less than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $130. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $130 is still above my budget. Even though she claims it's her final offer, there's usually room for a little more negotiation. I'll push a bit further, but I need to be ready to move closer to my limit or consider John's offer if she remains firm."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. Your willingness to compromise is great. How about we meet halfway between our last two offers at $105? That feels like a fair solution where we both get something we want."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing the ""final offer"":** By proposing a compromise at $105 (exactly halfway between $130 and $80), I'm testing the waters to see if Alice is truly firm on $130 or open to moving further.
* **Staying above budget (for now):** While $105 is still slightly above my $100 limit, it keeps the negotiation going while subtly signaling I'm getting closer to my maximum.
* **Emphasizing fairness and compromise:** I'm continuing to frame the negotiation positively, highlighting the mutual benefits of reaching an agreement.  

**Next Steps:**

* **If Alice accepts:** Great! I get the product for a price slightly above my ideal but still within a reasonable range.
* **If Alice rejects and counteroffers:**  I'll have to decide if I'm willing to go up to my absolute maximum of $100, or if it's time to walk away and buy from John."
