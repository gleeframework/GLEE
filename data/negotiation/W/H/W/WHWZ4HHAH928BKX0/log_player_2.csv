"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment you'll experience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone is important to encourage continued negotiation.  
* **Target in Mind:** Remember, our goal is to get the product for as close to $1,000,000 under our maximum budget of $1,200,000 as possible. This offer gives us room to move upward while still potentially securing a great deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is too low, I'm willing to move a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This reflects my product's value while still offering you a significant gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:**  We're moving up in smaller increments now to show Alice we're serious but also to avoid overshooting our target too quickly.
* **Compromise Emphasis:** Highlighting the idea of ""compromise"" can help keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Staying Below John's Price:** Our offer keeps us well below John's backup option of $1,200,000, maintaining our negotiation leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I recognize the importance of finding common ground.  Let's try $1,025,000. This represents a significant concession on my end while acknowledging the value you see in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  At $1,025,000, we're only $25,000 away from Alice's likely bottom line of $1,000,000.  This is a very good price considering our budget.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Further haggling carries the risk of Alice becoming frustrated or us missing out on a good deal. The potential savings of a few thousand dollars are likely not worth that risk. 
* **Time Value:**  Every round of negotiation takes time. Accepting now allows us to move forward with the purchase."
