Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible since that's what John will pay. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, starting high leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. Even if he rejects the initial price, we haven't lost the guaranteed $15,000 from John. 
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $14,999 feels significantly cheaper than $15,000 psychologically. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, since we have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, it's strategically sound to aim high initially."
