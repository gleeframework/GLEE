"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's more than double your maximum budget.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you a chance to negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes my limits early on and forces Alice to either accept a significant discount or continue negotiating."

Round 3

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly above my budget.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better price. There are still 7 rounds left, and I have the option of buying from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show that I'm willing to compromise but still trying to stay below my maximum budget. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, but it also shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget. There are still five rounds left, so I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better price.  There's still a chance I might be able to get a better deal.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 is still an option if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise but staying within my maximum budget.  I'm increasing my offer by a smaller increment than before, showing that I'm getting closer to my limit. With only four rounds left, I need to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still too high. With only three rounds left, the pressure is mounting. However, I'm going to stick to my strategy of gradual increases and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to increase my offer, but by a smaller amount. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm also getting closer to my limit. With only two rounds left, I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Alice to make a final concession."
