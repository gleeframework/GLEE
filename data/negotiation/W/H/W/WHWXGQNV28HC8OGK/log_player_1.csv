"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to gauge Bob's interest and establish a strong starting point for negotiation. If he's genuinely interested, he may be willing to come down from his initial price. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.  This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the door open to a deal with John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm aware that I have 10 rounds to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price so early on.  Rejecting his offer gives me an opportunity to counter with a more reasonable price, closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering $1,750,000, which is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still leaves room for potential compromise.  I'm aiming for a price that is both fair and profitable, considering my minimum price and Bob's potential interest. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also protecting my financial interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I believe there's still room for a more favorable deal, and rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating.  I'm also mindful that selling to John for $1,500,000 is always a viable option, giving me confidence to hold firm on my price expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm offering $1,600,000.  This is a compromise from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to meet Bob halfway. However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not giving away too much. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to seriously consider selling to John for $1,500,000 as we're approaching the midpoint of the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While we're nearing the midpoint of the negotiations, I'm still hoping to secure a better deal.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue exploring a price closer to my desired range.  Furthermore, selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe and secure option, giving me the leverage to hold firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

This is my final attempt to negotiate with Bob. I'm offering $1,550,000, which is just above my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be moving forward with selling the product to John for $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair offer, considering the value of the product and the limited time remaining in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left and Bob's offer still below my minimum acceptable price, the risk of failing to reach a deal is too high.  I'm confident that I can secure a deal with John for $1,500,000, which is a guaranteed outcome. It's time to move on and secure the deal that's most advantageous to me."
