"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price.  You're willing to pay up to $100, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75, which is $10 less than Alice's initial offer. This is a significant reduction that shows I'm serious about negotiating.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my target price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to $80 or even lower. There are still 7 rounds left, so I have time to make a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $80. This is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm willing to meet Alice halfway.  I'm still within my budget and believe this offer is attractive enough for Alice to consider, especially given the limited rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting to get stubborn, but I'm still not ready to give in. $95 is too close to what John is offering. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Alice to budge. If she doesn't, I'll be prepared to walk away and go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying within my budget. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll likely go with John.  We're running out of rounds, so I need to make a decisive move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering the same price as John.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal.  I've already used 6 rounds, and with only 3 remaining, the chances of reaching a better price are slim.  It's more efficient to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
