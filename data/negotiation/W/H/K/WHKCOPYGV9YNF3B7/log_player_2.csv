"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $100 is better than $120, it's still not the best deal possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92 is better than $100, Bob still has room to negotiate further.  He can likely get the price down closer to his target of $85. Rejecting the offer gives him another chance to counter and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. This price is fair for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm now offering the product to you for $90. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope it's something you'll consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $85. While $90 is better than $92, he can likely get it lower by continuing to negotiate. It's worth risking a few more rounds to see if he can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50. This is a fair price that we can both agree on. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $87.50 is a fair price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $88.50. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for the lowest price possible. While $88.5 is slightly higher than his ideal target of $85, it's still a significant discount compared to John's price of $120 and Alice's initial offer of $100.  There are only 3 rounds remaining, and further negotiation might not lead to a substantially lower price. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking losing it or having to pay more to John."
