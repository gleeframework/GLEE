"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a special opportunity for you to acquire an item that is truly exceptional and valuable, worth more than what you're willing to pay, but we believe this price is fair and reasonable considering its quality and benefits. We look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's perceived value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $12,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know if you're open to this offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer. Therefore, I would like to counteroffer at $11,000 for the product. This is a price that reflects both the value of the product and your willingness to pay. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum willingness to pay. Since Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $10,000, he should take that opportunity to avoid any further negotiation and ensure he gets the best possible price."
