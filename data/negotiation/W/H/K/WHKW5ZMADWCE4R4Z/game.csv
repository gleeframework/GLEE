"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a special opportunity for you to acquire an item that is truly exceptional and valuable, worth more than what you're willing to pay, but we believe this price is fair and reasonable considering its quality and benefits. We look forward to your response.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $12,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer. Therefore, I would like to counteroffer at $11,000 for the product. This is a price that reflects both the value of the product and your willingness to pay. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
