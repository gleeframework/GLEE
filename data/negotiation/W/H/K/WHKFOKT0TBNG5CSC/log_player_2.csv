The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she is offering it for $110.  You are willing to pay up to $120, so you have some room to negotiate. It's always worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $108. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108

``` 
Alice has come down to $108, which is within your budget and a good deal considering you're willing to pay up to $120. It's not a huge saving, but it's better than nothing!"
