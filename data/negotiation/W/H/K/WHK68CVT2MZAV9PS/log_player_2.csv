Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I understand you're looking for a good deal.  To be frank,  $7,000 is quite low for the value this product offers.  I could consider $11,000, which is a significant reduction on my part.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to make one final offer:  $10,000. This is my absolute bottom line, reflecting the product's true worth.  I need to know your decision soon as I have other interested buyers.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price and seems fixated on getting $10,000. At this point, it's unlikely further negotiation will get her much lower. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000, ensuring you stay within your budget."
