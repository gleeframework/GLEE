"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is significantly higher than $6,000. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $13,000 is still too high for me.  How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I understand you're looking for a good deal.  To be frank,  $7,000 is quite low for the value this product offers.  I could consider $11,000, which is a significant reduction on my part.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is closer, but I still need it to be a bit lower. Would you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to make one final offer:  $10,000. This is my absolute bottom line, reflecting the product's true worth.  I need to know your decision soon as I have other interested buyers.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,
