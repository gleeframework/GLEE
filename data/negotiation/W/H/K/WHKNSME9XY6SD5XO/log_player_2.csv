"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. $120 is still above your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is getting closer to your ideal price, you're still over budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further before potentially going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit over budget at $115. Would you consider $110? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $112. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $112 is getting closer to your goal, you've already rejected a similar price. It's unlikely you'll get a better offer from Alice, and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. You're better off buying from John for a guaranteed $100."
