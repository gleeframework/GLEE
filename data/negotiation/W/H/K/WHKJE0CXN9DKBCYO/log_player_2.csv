# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her, it's still lower than what John is selling it for. 
* **Saving money is the goal:**  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and accepting Alice's offer achieves that."
