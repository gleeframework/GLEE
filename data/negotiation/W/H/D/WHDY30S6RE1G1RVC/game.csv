"Alice, that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but it needs to be significantly lower to make sense for me. How about $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that's still quite a jump from my previous offer. I'm willing to go up to $75, but that's my absolute limit.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'll meet you halfway between $75 and $120, so I'm offering it to you for $97.50. This is my final offer for now.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  While $97.50 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I can do $80, and I think that's a fair compromise.  Otherwise, I might have to consider other options.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'll meet you at $90, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my last offer.",90.0,Alice,7,
