Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging. I want to make Bob feel valued and interested in buying the product.
* **Open Ended:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and opens the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a sale at a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to gauge Bob's interest and determine if I want to continue negotiating with him or sell to John for $100."
