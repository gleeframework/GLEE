"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. It's a unique opportunity and I believe you'd find it highly valuable. I'm asking for $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,150,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. How about $1,250,000? This price is still a great deal considering the value you place on the product, and it leaves room for us both to be satisfied. Let's aim for a win-win situation.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it's my absolute maximum budget. Let's close the deal at this price and avoid further negotiations.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
