Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit. If he rejects, I'll see what counteroffer he makes and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own. I'll always keep John's $10,000 offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could accept it and still make a profit, I'd rather see if I can get closer to my initial price. I'll counteroffer and see where that leads."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is still a fair bit above Bob's offer but closer to what I'd like to get for the product. Hopefully, this compromise will lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum price of $10,000, and it's more than what John is offering. I'll accept his offer to secure the sale and move on."
