Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $75 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $75 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit to $85.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the reduction in price. I would like to propose $80 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and since I can sell to John for the same amount, it makes sense to accept and finalize the deal."
