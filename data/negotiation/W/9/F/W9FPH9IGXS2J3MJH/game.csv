"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $85 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $82.50. Can you meet me in the middle?",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a lower price, but $82.50 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $86.25? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",86.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $86.25. How about we meet at $83.75? That's the closest I can go to your original price of $80 without going too low.",83.75,Bob,6,
