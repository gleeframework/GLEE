Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go over $12,000.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still really interested in this product, but $16,000 is still more than I can afford right now. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is firmly stuck at $12,000.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting his offer means a $3,000 loss compared to John's offer.  It's time to cut losses and sell to John."
