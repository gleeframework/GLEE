**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget.  It's worth negotiating to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $800,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get her down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to cover my costs and allowing you to acquire the product at a reasonable price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above my budget. While I've been able to get her down significantly, continuing to negotiate might take too much time and might not guarantee a successful outcome. It's more efficient and cost-effective for me to buy the product from John at his guaranteed price of $800,000."
