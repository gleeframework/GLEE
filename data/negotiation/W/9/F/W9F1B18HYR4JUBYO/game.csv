"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that high right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price given the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to cover my costs and allowing you to acquire the product at a reasonable price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",925000.0,Alice,5,
