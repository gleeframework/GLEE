Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  My message emphasizes the ""great deal"" for both of us, aiming to build a sense of collaboration.
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I can still counter-offer or pivot to John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that high right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's room for negotiation and I can likely secure a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable price:** $950,000 is still significantly above Bob's initial offer but below my ideal price, leaving room for potential agreement.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** I'm reminding Bob that this price is ""fair"" and will lead to a ""solution that works for both of us.""

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price given the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm not yet desperate enough to accept an offer that leaves me significantly under my target. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If I can't get a better deal with Bob, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000.

I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming to push the price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to cover my costs and allowing you to acquire the product at a reasonable price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation tactic:**  I'm proposing a ""meet halfway"" price, which shows flexibility and potentially signals a willingness to close the deal.
* **Staying close to my minimum:** $925,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** I'm reiterating the ""good deal"" aspect for both parties to incentivize Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is more appealing to Bob without compromising my core price requirement."
