"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I can match this price for anyone else. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. The product looks promising, but  $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider  $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $875,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be open to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $850,000.
