"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000. I think it's a fair price and I'm open to discussing further.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my best offer and reflects the product's worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $10,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line, but I'm willing to accept $14,000 to close this deal today.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is getting closer, I'm still only able to offer $12,000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I hope we can finalize this deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
