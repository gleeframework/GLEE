"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000. I think it's a fair price and I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my best offer and reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $10,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line, but I'm willing to accept $14,000 to close this deal today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if we can reach a more agreeable price. I'll make another counteroffer, hoping to find a price closer to my maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is getting closer, I'm still only able to offer $12,000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I hope we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
