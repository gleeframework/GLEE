Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a good starting point:** It's a significant discount for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000, but it still gives me a profit well above my minimum of $10,000.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm trying to build a rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind and will likely accept any offer above $10,000.
* **Bob's willingness to negotiate:** If Bob is hesitant or immediately counters with a very low offer, I might need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but I'm only willing to pay $12500.  I'm confident that's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I want to try and negotiate a better price with Bob, so I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm happy to accept $13,250 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** My counteroffer is $13,250. It's a compromise, exactly halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. 
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I'm still being friendly and aiming to build a rapport, but I'm also emphasizing that my offer is a fair compromise.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob that he still gets a good deal at my counteroffer price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's offer:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, John's offer of $10,000 is still in the back of my mind. 
* **Bob's reaction:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll have to evaluate if it's worth continuing negotiations or selling to John."
