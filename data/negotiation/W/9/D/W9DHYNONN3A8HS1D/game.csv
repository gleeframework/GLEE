"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet closer to the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $13,500 is getting closer, but I need to be sure this is a worthwhile deal. Could you meet me at $15,500? This would make it worth my while.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but $15,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the highest I'm comfortable paying. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,6,
