Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate the opportunity to own this unique product,  $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum value and the potential of finding a similar product elsewhere. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
