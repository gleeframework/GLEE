"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate the opportunity to own this unique product,  $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum value and the potential of finding a similar product elsewhere. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800000. This is my final offer, as I am prepared to purchase the product from John at that price if we can't agree.",800000.0,Bob,4,
