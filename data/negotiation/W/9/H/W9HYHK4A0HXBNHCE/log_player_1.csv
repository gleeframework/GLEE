Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for a good profit, and $12,000 is $4,000 above your minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has a clear incentive to negotiate. 
* **It allows you to gauge his interest:** If he rejects this offer, it gives you valuable information about how seriously he wants the product.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can then adjust your counteroffer based on his counteroffer and how much you're willing to compromise. Remember, you have a backup option with John, which gives you leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is above my minimum, it's significantly less than what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a compromise that might be acceptable to Bob. I'm hoping to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still lower than my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering that:

* **It's above my minimum:** I'm still getting a decent profit, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000.
* **The negotiation is getting lengthy:** Each round of negotiation takes time, and there's no guarantee that Bob will continue to increase his offer.
* **I have a fallback option:** If I need to, I can always sell to John.

This seems like a reasonable outcome, given the circumstances."
