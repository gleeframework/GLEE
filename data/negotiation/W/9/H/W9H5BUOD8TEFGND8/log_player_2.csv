Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to pay $8,700, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I can offer it to you for $9,100. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.

While I could push Alice a little further, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $9,100. Accepting this offer saves me almost $3,000 compared to John's price, and further haggling might annoy Alice and risk losing the deal."
