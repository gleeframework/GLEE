Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000. I'll give you one more chance to meet me at $11,500. This is my final offer.

While I could try to haggle Alice down further, she's signaled that this is her final offer. Accepting at $11,500 is still a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 price."
