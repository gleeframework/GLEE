"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point to maximize my profit. This is a fair price considering the product's value to Bob. I'm also making it clear that I am open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. It's a fair price considering it's worth $80 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $95? That's still a great value for you considering the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 

I'm offering $95, which is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about $90? It's a bit closer to my target, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is close to my minimum acceptable price and represents a good compromise.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and risk losing him as a buyer."
