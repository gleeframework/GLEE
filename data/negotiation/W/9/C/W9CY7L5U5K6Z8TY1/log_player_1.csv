Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the market value is $12000 to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $12,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4

Bob's offer of $13,000 is close enough to my desired price point.  It's worth accepting to close the deal and avoid risking further negotiation."
