"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's find a middle ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12,250. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
