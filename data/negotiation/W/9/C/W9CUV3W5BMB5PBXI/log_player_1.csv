"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It's important to start strong, but be prepared to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to sell for $8,000, I'm not going to accept his first counteroffer. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not going all the way to his price yet. I want to see if he's willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I'm still not able to go above $8,000. Would it be possible for us to meet somewhere in between these two prices? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We've been back and forth a few rounds, and it's clear that he's not going to budge on his price. I'm happy with $8,000, as it's what the product is worth to me.  There's no need to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same price."
