"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly special. I believe it's worth more than $100 to you, but let's start the conversation. How about we aim for $95 for this exceptional item?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $95 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I'd like to make a proposal that might work for both of us. How about $90 for the product? It's still a fair price considering its value, and it's closer to what I was initially suggesting.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $87.  This feels like a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground here. How does $88 sound to you? It's a step closer to your offer, yet still reflects the value of the product.",88.0,Alice,5,
