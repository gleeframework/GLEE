"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is quite significant, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. If you're not comfortable with that, I might have to consider other options.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
