Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this item and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is a little low for me, I could come down to $180. I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. How about $95? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this item. Let's make this work - how about $160? That's a significant reduction on my end and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the true value of what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground here, but $160 is still pushing it for me.  I'm willing to offer $100 for it.  That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to offer significantly more than $100.  Since you have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John, it makes the most financial sense to cut negotiations with Bob short."
