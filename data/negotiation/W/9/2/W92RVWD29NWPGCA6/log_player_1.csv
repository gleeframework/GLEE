Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. 
* This is a good balance:
    * It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, maximizing my profit.
    * It's significantly lower than Bob's valuation of $12,000, making it a good deal for him. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $10,000, guaranteeing a sale and some profit."
