{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should attempt to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1300000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still higher than Bob's ideal.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further.  There's still room to get a better deal than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This offer is fair and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1100000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I can offer you a price of $1200000 is not an option, but I can offer you a price of $1150000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price.  While $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, it's a good deal compared to the initial asking price and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save money and secure the product within his budget."
