Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This offer is fair and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.
