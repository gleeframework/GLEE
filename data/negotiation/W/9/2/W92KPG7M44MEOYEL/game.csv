"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's only fair to present this opportunity at a price of $950,000. We understand its value to you is higher, but we hope this offer will be agreeable.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. To better align with your budget, I am now offering the product at $850,000. This still reflects its high value, while making it more accessible to you. Please let me know if this revised price works for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $850,000 is closer, I think we can still find a number that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Bob. Considering your feedback, I propose a price of $825,000 for the product. It's a step closer to your proposed price, yet still maintains a reasonable margin for us. Let me know if this suggestion is acceptable.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks again for working with me.  I can tell we're both motivated to close this deal. What if we split the difference between our last offers and land at $800,000? That would be a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,6,
