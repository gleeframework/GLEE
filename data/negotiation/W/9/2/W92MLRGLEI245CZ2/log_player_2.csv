"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's chat about it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is a bit high. There's a chance I can get a better price by rejecting it and seeing if she'll come down.  Worst case, I buy from John for $100."
