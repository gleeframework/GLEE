# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd find very valuable. It's worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is significantly lower than what I need to part with this product, I'm willing to come down to $1750000 to see if we can reach a compromise.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your limitations while also allowing me to cover my own costs.  Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll try to counteroffer again to see if we can find a compromise."
