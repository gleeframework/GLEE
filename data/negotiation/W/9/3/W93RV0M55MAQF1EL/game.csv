"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd find very valuable. It's worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is far outside my budget. I'm very interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is significantly lower than what I need to part with this product, I'm willing to come down to $1750000 to see if we can reach a compromise.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your limitations while also allowing me to cover my own costs.  Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $1375000?  This would allow me to purchase the product while also allowing you to make a profit.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
