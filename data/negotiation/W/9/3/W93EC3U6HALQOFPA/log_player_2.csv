Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000 to show you my commitment to a deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $1300000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This price is fair to both of us and allows me to cover my costs while still giving you a valuable asset. What do you say?
