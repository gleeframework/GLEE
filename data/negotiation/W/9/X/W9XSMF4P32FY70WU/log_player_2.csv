"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique item. I believe you'll really appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Even though Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can force a lower price from John, who is the only other option."
