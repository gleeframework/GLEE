"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll really benefit from it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product could be beneficial for me, but the price point is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
