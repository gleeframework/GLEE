Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer. What do you think?

I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. It's time to cut the negotiation and buy from John for $800,000."
