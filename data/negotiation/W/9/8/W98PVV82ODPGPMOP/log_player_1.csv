Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, the offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still landing within a range profitable for Alice.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering it for more than $15,000 would likely make Bob reject the offer outright. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup buyer."
