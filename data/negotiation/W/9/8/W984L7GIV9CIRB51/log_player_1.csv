Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a great deal for you. 
* **Time Value:** Mentioning listing it publicly implies you have other options and creates a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
