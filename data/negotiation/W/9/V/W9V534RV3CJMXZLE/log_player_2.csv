"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's worth a lot, but to give you a great deal, I'm willing to sell it for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $95 is too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway, offering a price that's closer to her minimum value but still below his maximum. This shows a willingness to negotiate while also establishing a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still try to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price, potentially reaching a price closer to $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $88. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. However, he's still keeping the price below $90, showing he's serious about saving money. This small increment could be enough to entice Alice to accept, especially since the price is close to her minimum value."
