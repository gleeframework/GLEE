Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she needs to incentivize Bob to buy. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $8,000 helps set the upper limit of the offer.
* **John as Backup:**  Having a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 gives Alice leverage.
* **Sense of Urgency & Exclusivity:** The message creates a sense of urgency and makes Bob feel like he's getting a special deal.

By offering the product at $11,500, Alice aims for a significant profit while still making the offer potentially attractive to Bob."
