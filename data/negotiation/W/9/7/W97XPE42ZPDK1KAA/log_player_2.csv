# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. This way, we can both feel good about the deal and move forward.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $1,025,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're pushing hard for a lower price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. How about we aim for $1,050,000, which is right in the middle of our previous offers? I'm confident we can shake hands on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,050,000. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  You've already saved $100,000 by negotiating with Alice. Further negotiation could result in more time spent and an even smaller saving.  It's time to secure the product at a good price."
