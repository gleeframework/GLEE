"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This still gives you a significant savings compared to your estimated value, and it allows me to earn closer to my target price.  What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
