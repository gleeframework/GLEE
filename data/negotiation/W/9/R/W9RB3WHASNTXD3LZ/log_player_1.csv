Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest. This allows for some room for negotiation if he counters. However, I'm also mindful of John's offer, so I won't drop too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering a price halfway between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I still want to get as close to my minimum value as possible."
