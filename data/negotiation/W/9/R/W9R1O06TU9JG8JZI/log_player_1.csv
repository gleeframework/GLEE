Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $175. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to him and my minimum acceptable price. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I'm also prepared to sell to John for $150 if the negotiations don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $165.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise considering his initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it. This is a better outcome than selling to John for $150."
