"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is well above your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a significant difference between $12,000 and Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him room to counter without feeling pressured. 
* **It shows confidence:**  A starting price closer to your desired price point shows confidence in your product's value.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is your minimum, it's still worth exploring whether you can get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,000 to meet you halfway. This still leaves room for me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $9,000, which is only $1,000 below your initial offer and a significant improvement on his previous offer.  It's likely that he won't come up much higher, so accepting his offer is a good strategy to secure a sale and get a decent price."
