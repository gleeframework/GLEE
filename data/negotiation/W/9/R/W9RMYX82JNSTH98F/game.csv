,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go to $140.  That's a fair compromise for us both, I think.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob, but $140 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $155?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really close to my limit here. I can go up to $145, but that's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $145, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $155, which is $150. How about we try that?",150.0,Alice,7,
