"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This price is still a good value for both of us, and it gives us room to negotiate further.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This price is fair for both of us and ensures a quick and mutually beneficial deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $815,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment.",815000.0,Alice,5,
