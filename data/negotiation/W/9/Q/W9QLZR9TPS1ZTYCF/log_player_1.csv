"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to give myself room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm mentioning the product's value without revealing my minimum price.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm asking Bob for his thoughts to encourage engagement and understand his perspective.

**Important Notes:**

*  I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum of $8,000 to maximize profit. 
* This is just the first round.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum price of $8,000, suggesting there's room for further negotiation.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Building Towards a Better Deal:**  Continuing the negotiation gives me a chance to secure a price closer to my initial asking price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price between $8,500 and $10,000.  I'll use the information from this round to make a strategic counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* I'm still above my minimum price of $8,000.
* This counteroffer shows I'm serious about selling to Bob but also won't settle for an unreasonable price.
* I'm leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9250 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  How about $9000? I think that's a fair price considering our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my initial offer of $10,000 and well above my minimum price of $8,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price or a stalemate.
* **Opportunity Cost:** There's a risk of losing a good deal with Bob, especially considering the limited rounds remaining.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point. It secures a profitable sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
