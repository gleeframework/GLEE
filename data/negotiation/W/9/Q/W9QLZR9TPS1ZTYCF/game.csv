"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500? ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9250?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9250 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  How about $9000? I think that's a fair price considering our positions.",9000.0,Bob,4,
