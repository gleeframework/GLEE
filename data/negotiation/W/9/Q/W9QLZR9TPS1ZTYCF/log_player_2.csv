"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $10000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$10,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.**  You have a clear upper limit of $12,000, so it's worth trying to get a better price.
* **It's early in the negotiation.**  Rejecting the offer doesn't mean you're walking away. It allows you to test the waters and see how flexible Alice is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating that you're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $8,500 is still well within your budget, leaving space for Alice to counter without you having to immediately consider John's offer. 
* **Shows interest:**  The positive message reassures Alice that you're still interested in buying, just at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9250?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction.**  She's lowered her price, showing she's open to negotiation.
* **$9,250 is still a bit high.**  You're aiming for a lower price, and it's too early to settle. 
* **There's still room to negotiate.** You're willing to pay more than your initial counteroffer, but you're not ready to jump at this price yet. 

This rejection allows you to continue the negotiation and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  How about $9,000? I think that's a fair price considering our positions."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant step:** This counteroffer is a smaller decrease from Alice's offer than your previous counteroffer, showing a willingness to be reasonable while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Focus on fairness:** The message emphasizes finding a ""fair price,"" further promoting the idea of a compromise.
* **Staying within your budget:** $9,000 is still well within your $12,000 budget, leaving you with a good margin for negotiation."
