{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

 Alice's starting offer is a bit high. I should try to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider buying the product for $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to my desired price, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit further before considering John's offer."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $95, Bob. But I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $100? That's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's the minimum you're willing to pay, so it seems like a fair deal to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering the product at her lowest acceptable price, which is also within my budget. It makes no sense to negotiate further or go with John's higher price."
