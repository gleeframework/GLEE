"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $8,500 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $9,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I really think you'll be happy with this product.",9000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate the bonus offer, but $8,000 is still too low for me. I'm committed to finding a fair price that works for both of us.  Let's try $8,750. It's a compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both sides.  What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,7,
