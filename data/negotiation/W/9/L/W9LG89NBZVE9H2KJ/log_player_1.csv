I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I'm a bit disappointed that I couldn't get closer to my target price with Bob, it's important to recognize when it's time to walk away from a negotiation.  John is offering a fair price, and it's better than risking a stalemate with Bob and ending up with less money."
