This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
