"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value of the product, to encourage him to accept. 

I'm hoping to secure a deal that's close to my minimum value, but I'm also aware that Bob might counteroffer, so I'm prepared for multiple rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price. I'm confident that I can push for a higher amount through further negotiation. Selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal with Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price to $11,000, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm highlighting the discount I'm offering to incentivize Bob to accept.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will convince Bob to close the deal, but I'm prepared for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob seems firm on his $9,000 offer. This is getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm worried that further negotiation will not lead to a significantly better outcome. With John offering a much more appealing price of $15,000, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue with Bob.  It's time to secure the sale with John and avoid the risk of ending up with a much lower price."
