Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that point."", ""product_price"": 9000}
