Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This initial offer is a strong starting point for negotiation, and I'm confident I can secure a sale at a price that's both fair and beneficial to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,000,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation going and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm reducing my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm at a price that reflects the product's true value. $1,750,000 is a reasonable compromise and hopefully, Bob will find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not acceptable. I'm going to counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."

I'm making a final concession to Bob, dropping my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant offer, and I'm hoping that Bob will see its value and accept it. If he rejects this, I'll be forced to sell to John to ensure I don't lose out on a significant profit."
