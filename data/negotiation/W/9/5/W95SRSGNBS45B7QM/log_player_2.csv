"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$200 is above your budget. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

Starting with a counteroffer of $120, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within your budget, will test the waters."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Since Alice's offer is still above your budget, we'll try one more time with a counteroffer of $140. This is a compromise point, and Alice may be willing to accept it as it's closer to her previous offer."
