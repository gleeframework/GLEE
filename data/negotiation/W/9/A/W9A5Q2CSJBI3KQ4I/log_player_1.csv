Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I still believe $950,000 is a fair price given my budget constraints. I would like to stick to that figure if possible. If not, I'll consider buying the product from John for $800,000.

Bob is holding firm at $950,000 and even threatening to go to a competitor (though John buying from Bob doesn't make sense in our scenario). It's clear Bob is unlikely to move significantly from this price point.  Since I can get my desired price from John, it's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob."
