"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations in terms of value. How about we meet halfway?  I'm willing to let it go for $1,025,000.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I still believe $950,000 is a fair price given my budget constraints. I would like to stick to that figure if possible. If not, I'll consider buying the product from John for $800,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
