"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer of $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking with your offer of $85, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $105, which is $95. Would you be willing to consider that?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still below my maximum budget.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell for $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which is $97.50. That's the best I can do.",97.5,Alice,7,
