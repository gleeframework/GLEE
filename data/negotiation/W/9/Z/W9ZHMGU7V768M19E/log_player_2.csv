"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. It's something that I'm confident could significantly benefit your operations. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value while still being fair to both of us.  I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find the return on investment to be substantial.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
