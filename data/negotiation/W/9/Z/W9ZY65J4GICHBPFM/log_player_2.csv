Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his price limit, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further or going with John."

Bob is offering $15,500. This is a compromise, still below his maximum price, but it's getting closer to Alice's desired price.  This might be a good point to see if Alice will budge."
