"I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. Can you consider this price?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $875,000? This reflects the unique value of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $825,000. Can you consider this price?",825000.0,Bob,4,
