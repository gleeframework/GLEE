,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it's closer to my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,120,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,120,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,105,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product and gets us closer to an agreement.",1105000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,115,000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm starting to get concerned that we might not reach an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,115,000, but I need to make a profit, and this is the final price I'm willing to consider.",1115000.0,Alice,9,
