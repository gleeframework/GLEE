Bob should reject the offer. While it's tempting to accept, he can likely do better.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to him, so there's room to negotiate."

# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.
