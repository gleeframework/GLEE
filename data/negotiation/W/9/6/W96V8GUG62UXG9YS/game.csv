"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That way, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
