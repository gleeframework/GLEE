{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **Above Bob's Value:** The price is above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving him room to negotiate.
* **Below Your Minimum:** The price is below your minimum of $15,000, giving you room to negotiate and still make a profit.
* **Encourages Negotiation:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in a negotiation, allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially get closer to your desired price.

This strategy aims to balance securing a good price with keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counter-offer, or I can choose to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective, but based on my needs and budget, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. I appreciate your understanding and hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum target of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as there's still room for a mutually beneficial deal. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my target and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $12,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500.  This would allow us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. This demonstrates flexibility and shows that I'm serious about finding a compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I remind Bob that $13,500 is still a good deal for him considering the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is open-ended and encourages Bob to respond, allowing for further negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between my desire to get closer to my target price and keeping the negotiation moving forward. I believe this offer gives Bob a reasonable opportunity to agree while still allowing me to secure a decent price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to agree to $13,500. I would like to propose $12,500 as a fair compromise. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $12,500 is still below my minimum target of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I've reached a point where I'm not comfortable going any lower.  I believe John's offer of $15,000 is a much more attractive option and allows me to maximize my profits.  I'm going to stop negotiating with Bob and sell to John."
