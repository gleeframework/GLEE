Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $100 starts the negotiation at a price closer to my minimum value ($120) while still leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value and deal aspect, hoping to entice Bob into accepting.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I aim to maximize my profit while keeping the door open for a deal with Bob.  However, I'm prepared to walk away if the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory price point for me.  The offer to John provides a safety net, guaranteeing me my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While Bob is interested, he's willing to pay less than my minimum. There's potential to get a better price through further negotiation.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** If negotiation fails, John offers a guaranteed $120, which is more profitable than accepting Bob's offer.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to try and find a middle ground. If the negotiation doesn't yield a better price than $120, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price point above my minimum.
* **Value Proposition:** The message reiterates the ""great deal"" aspect for Bob and justifies the price based on my needs.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for further discussion, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

By showing willingness to compromise and highlighting the value proposition for Bob, I aim to incentivize him to accept the counteroffer.  If he rejects again, I'll reassess the situation and decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but $85 is the most I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has shown willingness to compromise, $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Further negotiation unlikely to yield significant improvement:**  It's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly, and further negotiation would likely be time-consuming and unproductive.
* **John's offer is the most profitable option:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $120, which is significantly better than accepting Bob's offer. 

**Strategy:**

To maximize my profit, I'll sell to John.  Even though Bob is interested, his offer is too low, and there's a better opportunity to get a higher price by selling to John."
