Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so that's your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 and $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

The ideal outcome is to get Bob to pay as close to $1,200,000 as possible. However, we don't want to scare him off with too high a price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is an exclusive offer creates a sense of urgency and value.
* **Value-Based Language:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, the message emphasizes the ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits.""
* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,100,000 is a strong opening position. It leaves room for negotiation while still aiming high.

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects $1,100,000, you have room to come down slightly while still staying above your guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
