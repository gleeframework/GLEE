We're getting close, but it's still worthwhile to see if Alice will go lower.  We'll counteroffer just above our walk-away price in the next round."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $13,500. I'm willing to make one more concession.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough one! Alice seems pretty firm, and we're running out of rounds.  While we *could* try to squeeze a bit more, there's a real risk Alice won't budge and we'll end up with John's $10,000 offer anyway. 

Let's take the win.
