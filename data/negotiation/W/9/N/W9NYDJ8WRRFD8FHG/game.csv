"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $15,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $13,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting close to what I can do. I can offer $13,500.  If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $13,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $13,750. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13750.0,Alice,7,
