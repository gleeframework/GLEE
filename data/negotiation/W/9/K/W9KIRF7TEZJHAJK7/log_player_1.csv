Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**  Bob seems very firm on staying close to his $70-$75 offer range. It's unlikely we'll get much higher, and we risk him walking away entirely in later rounds. John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price, so it's time to cut our losses and take the sure thing."
