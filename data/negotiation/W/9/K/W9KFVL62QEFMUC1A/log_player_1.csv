{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I think it's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is well above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  It's also below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, giving him room to potentially negotiate.
* **It shows you're serious:** This offer demonstrates you're willing to negotiate but are not desperate to sell. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
