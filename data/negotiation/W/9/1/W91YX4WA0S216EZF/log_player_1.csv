Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $149. I think it's a great deal and you'll find it very useful."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, your goal is to get as close to that price as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $149 leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to counter-offer if he's inclined, potentially increasing your profit slightly.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price just below your guaranteed sale price creates a high anchor point. While Bob may not pay $149, it makes a lower counter-offer from him more likely to be closer to your desired range."
