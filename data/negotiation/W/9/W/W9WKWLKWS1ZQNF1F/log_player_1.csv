"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will counter with a lower price, and we can reach a mutually agreeable deal.  However, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come close to my minimum of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to settle. I'll see if I can push for a bit more by counter-offering. I'm confident I can get at least $1,500,000 with John, so I have a safety net if this negotiation doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to my desired price and closer to his value. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a higher offer. I'm still prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to settle for $1,350,000. I'll see if I can push for a bit more with another counter-offer. I'm still confident I can get at least $1,500,000 with John, so I have a safety net if this negotiation doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer but still above my minimum and John's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a final, acceptable offer. I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This negotiation is getting tense.  While $1,300,000 is not terrible, it's below my minimum and I'm not sure if I can get Bob to go higher.  I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000 with John.  I'll take the safe route and sell to John."
