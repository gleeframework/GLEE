Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is better than selling to John, but I think I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering $13,000. This is a compromise that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I hope this will encourage Bob to agree to a deal without going through further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $11,500 is a decent price, and it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for less."
