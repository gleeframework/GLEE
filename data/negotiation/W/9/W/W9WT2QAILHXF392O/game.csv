"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $11,250? This feels like a fair compromise.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I can stay within my means.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us. While I'm aiming higher, I'm willing to come down to $10,800. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.  What do you say?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your compromise, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to make sure I can stay within my means.",10200.0,Bob,6,
