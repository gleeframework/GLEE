"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you meet me at this price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  While I understand your perspective on market value, this product is truly unique and has a potential far exceeding comparable items.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about we meet at $1200000? This price reflects the product's potential and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss $1000000? I'm confident that's a fair price for a product with this potential.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
