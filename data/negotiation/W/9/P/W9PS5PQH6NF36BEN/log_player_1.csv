Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I can lower the price a bit, but I'll also consider selling to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, even though it's closer to my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price point.  I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800, which still gives you a great value.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

This counteroffer is a small step toward Bob's price, but it's still significantly higher than his offer. I'm hoping this signals my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a decent profit margin. I'll keep John in mind as a backup, but I'm willing to see if we can reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I would like to counter with an offer of $10,600. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. At this point, I'm getting frustrated with the negotiation and I'm not sure Bob will meet my desired price point.  It's time to move on and take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
