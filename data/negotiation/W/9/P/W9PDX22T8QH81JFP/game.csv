Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. What do you think?,90.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $70 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $90, which would be $80. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",80.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $75, Bob. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $82. It's a fair price considering the product's quality and uniqueness. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,5,
