"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point to maximize my potential profit while still being attractive to Bob.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit high for me, I'd be willing to pay $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low for me.  While I want to make a sale, I need to get closer to my minimum of $120.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 
I'm trying to find a price that's fair for both of us, but I need to stay above my minimum. $85 is a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about $70?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to close the deal, $70 is still too low for me. I need to stay closer to my minimum value of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $75?  It's a fair price that gets us both closer to our desired outcome."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might be willing to accept while still ensuring I get a reasonable price. I'm hoping he sees that $75 is a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $72?  That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $72 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough for me. I need to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $72 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $73.  This is my final offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 73}
```

I'm pushing for a slightly higher price, but I'm also indicating that this is my final offer.  This might encourage Bob to accept, as he knows further negotiation could lead to me selling to John instead."
