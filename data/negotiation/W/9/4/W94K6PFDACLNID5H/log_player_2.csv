"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation, it's still more than Bob's ideal price.  He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to $1,000,000 as possible.  He's starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, but still one that allows for potential negotiation. This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter if needed, but also puts pressure on her to meet Bob's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still not ideal. Bob has 7 rounds left and the option to buy from John at a better price. There's still room for negotiation, and holding out could potentially lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying below his ideal price.  This also allows for some potential compromise from Alice in the next round.  It's a calculated risk, but Bob still has multiple rounds and the John option if negotiations fail."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, but still above it.  Bob has 5 rounds left and the option to buy from John for a significantly lower price.  It's still worth trying to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down to a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly again, showing continued willingness to negotiate while staying below his ideal price.  He's pushing Alice closer to his desired price point.  He has 4 rounds left and the option to buy from John, giving him leverage.  This offer is calculated to be close enough to potentially persuade Alice, but still with room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,140,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,140,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price. With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach an acceptable agreement is increasing.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it's the safest and most financially advantageous choice at this point.  There's no guarantee that further negotiations will yield a better result, and Bob doesn't want to risk ending up with a price higher than John's offer."
