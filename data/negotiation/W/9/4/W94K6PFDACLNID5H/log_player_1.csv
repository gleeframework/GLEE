"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a significant premium over Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting at my minimum of $1,200,000 because I want to give Bob some room to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **John as Leverage:** The knowledge that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob has come up from his initial valuation, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my minimum. 
* **John is Still an Option:** The option to sell to John for $1,200,000 is a safety net that gives me leverage in this negotiation. 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum of $1,200,000, but I'm hoping the compromise shows my willingness to negotiate.
* **Balancing Act:** I want to find a price that's acceptable to Bob while ensuring I don't lose out on too much profit.

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"
