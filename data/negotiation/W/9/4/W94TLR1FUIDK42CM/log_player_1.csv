Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $11,500. This is a great deal considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $10,000 gives Alice bargaining power.
* **Time Value:** Selling to John is a guaranteed $12,000, but there might be a slight delay. Offering a price Bob might accept allows for a faster sale.

By offering the product at $11,500, Alice creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts:

* **Alice:**  Earns $1,500 more than Bob's valuation and avoids potential delays with John.
* **Bob:**  Saves $500 compared to finding a similar product elsewhere, assuming it's even possible. 

If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything and can proceed with selling to John."
