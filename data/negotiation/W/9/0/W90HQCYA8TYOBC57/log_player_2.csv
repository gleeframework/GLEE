# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.

```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price once again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm still not willing to go below $1125000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, and $1,125,000 is still higher than his maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John, who is willing to sell it for his maximum budget.  While further negotiations with Alice might potentially lead to a lower price, there's no guarantee, and Bob could end up spending more time and energy without a better outcome."
