"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to buy from John and save $200,000."
