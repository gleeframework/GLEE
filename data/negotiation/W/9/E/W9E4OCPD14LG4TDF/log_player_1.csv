``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that I can always come down if needed.  This gives me room to negotiate and still make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm confident I can get a better price. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $2,000,000.  I have 9 rounds left, and I believe there's room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. While $1800000 is closer to what I'm willing to pay, I still can't meet that price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1650000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  $1,650,000 is getting closer to my desired range, but I have a few more rounds to try and get closer to my target. I'm also aware that selling to John would only give me $1,500,000, so I need to keep pushing with Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  $1,675,000 is getting closer, but I have a few more rounds and I don't want to settle too quickly.  I'm confident I can get a better offer, and I'm not willing to sell to John yet for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to go down to $1,700,000. This is a very fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise.  We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, so I hope you'll seriously consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, I still have two rounds left and I think there's room for a higher price. I also don't want to rush into a decision, especially when John is still waiting in the wings offering $1,500,000. I need to weigh my options carefully and try to squeeze out as much profit as I can."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm feeling optimistic about reaching a deal.  I'm prepared to meet you at $1,692,500.  This is a very fair offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1692500}

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the final round, and Bob's offer is very close to my desired price.  While I'd prefer more, it's better to secure the deal than risk getting nothing. It's also important to remember that John is still waiting to buy at $1,500,000, so I need to make a decision now.  I'm accepting Bob's offer."
