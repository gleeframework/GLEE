"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $1,300,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This allows for a mutually beneficial deal while still reflecting the product's value. Let's see if we can bridge this gap.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
