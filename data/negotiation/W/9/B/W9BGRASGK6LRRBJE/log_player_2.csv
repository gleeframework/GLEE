{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $15,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me for this product. However, $20,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident in the value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $17,500 is still above my budget. I'll try to negotiate further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still a bit over my budget. Would you be willing to do $16,000?  I'm serious about this product and believe it's a good value for both of us at this price."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $16,000 is close, but I need to get at least $16,500 for this to make sense. How about we split the difference? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. While I could try another counteroffer, the risk of not reaching a deal is too high.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
