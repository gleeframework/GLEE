"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $14,000.  I think it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget and even higher than her own valuation of the product. It makes much more sense to negotiate or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider selling it for $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. While it might seem aggressive, it leaves room for negotiation and helps you understand Alice's flexibility. 
* **Budget-Conscious:** The offer of $6,000 is well within your budget and allows for potential compromise while still saving you a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offer and John's alternative.
* **Gauging Interest:**  A low counteroffer can help gauge how eager Alice is to sell. If she's willing to negotiate significantly, it might indicate the product isn't as valuable as she initially presented."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her offer of $10,500 is still significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It makes sense to continue negotiating and see if you can get closer to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Could we possibly settle around $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. It's a significant increase from your initial offer, signaling flexibility, but still below both Alice's current offer and your maximum budget. 
* **Staying Competitive with John:** Offering $7,500 keeps you in a competitive position with John's $8,000 offer. It gives Alice an incentive to consider your offer seriously. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By staying under $8,000, you maintain some room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer but is still open to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some middle ground.  How about $9,000? That's a significant reduction on my part. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but $9,000 is still $1,000 more than John's offer. There's room for Alice to come down further, so it's worth making one more counteroffer before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I could meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $8,250?"",
""product_price"": 8250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer represents a final attempt to secure a deal with Alice while staying below your budget. It splits the difference between your last offer ($7,500) and her current one ($9,000). 
* **Slight Edge Over John:** Offering $8,250 is slightly higher than John's $8,000, potentially swaying Alice if she's motivated to sell.
* **Clear Decision Point:**  This counteroffer establishes a clear point for both you and Alice. If she rejects it, you know it's time to go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you've driven a hard bargain! I can go as low as $8,750, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $8,750 is her final offer. While this is closer to your budget, it's still more expensive than buying from John for $8,000.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
