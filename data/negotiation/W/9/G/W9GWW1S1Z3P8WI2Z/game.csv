"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Could we possibly settle around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I could meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $8,250?",8250.0,Bob,6,
