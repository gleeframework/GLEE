"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for your business.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's far too high.  He wants to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is well above his maximum budget.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering your product, but $1,200,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value and my opportunity cost.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that would give us both a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her first offer, it's still above his budget. He should continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to his target. He still has rounds left and John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  I'd like to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's see if we can work together to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too far from my ideal price.  However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we settle on $975,000?  This would be a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his target price, it's still above his budget. He has several rounds left and should continue to negotiate.  There's a good chance Alice will come down further, especially as she's already shown a willingness to compromise. If negotiations stall, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping we can find a number that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and we're getting closer.  While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the product's true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $962,500.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it will be a win-win for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal on this number. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice's offer is tempting and getting closer to his target, it's still above his budget. He's already rejected several offers and is getting close to the end of the rounds.  Buying from John guarantees him the product at a price that fits within his budget, and saves him the risk of further negotiation."
