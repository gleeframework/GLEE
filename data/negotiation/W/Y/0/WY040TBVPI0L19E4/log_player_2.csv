"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. It's worth a lot more to me than that, but I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,750?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.
