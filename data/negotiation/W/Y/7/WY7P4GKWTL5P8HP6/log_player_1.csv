""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets a $300,000 discount from the product's worth to him, making it an attractive deal.
    * Alice earns a $100,000 profit compared to selling to John.
* **Urgency & Exclusivity:**  The message emphasizes a limited-time offer and Bob's unique position, encouraging quicker action."
