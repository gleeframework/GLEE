"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9250? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9250 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $9000.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $9500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9500 is still a bit above what I can afford right now.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at $9200. This price is still fair for you, considering the value of the product, and it would allow me to purchase it comfortably.",9200.0,Bob,6,
