Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate, but still ensures a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Create Urgency:** The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" subtly implies that if Bob doesn't take the deal, someone else might. 

This approach aims to secure a deal that's highly profitable for you while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept."
