Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This gives Bob a little room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll keep in mind that I can always go to John if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $120. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counter-offering with $125. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's a compromise that might be more appealing to him. I'm hoping to close the deal without having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $120. While I'd prefer to get a bit more, I'm not confident he'll go any higher. It's better to sell to John and guarantee my desired profit than to risk getting stuck in a negotiation loop."
