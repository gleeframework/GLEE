"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer slightly below the midpoint between Alice's valuation ($80) and our maximum price ($100). This gives us room to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $85. How about we try $87.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a price we find acceptable, we still have room to negotiate. We'll reject this offer and propose a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle on $82? That's a fair price and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree."",
""product_price"": 82
}
``` 

We're proposing a price slightly above Alice's valuation while still staying well below our maximum. This shows Alice we're serious about buying while aiming for a price that benefits us both.  By expressing a willingness to ""close the deal,"" we're adding a bit of urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to considering other offers, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $84? It's still a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that she's nearing her limit. While we could try to negotiate further, $84 is a good price, saving us $16 compared to John's offer. It's best to accept now and avoid the risk of Alice walking away from the negotiation."
