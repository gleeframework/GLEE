"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by me due to its unique features and quality. Considering its worth to you might be around $100, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $125? This offers a slight premium over its perceived value to you while ensuring a good return for me.",125.0,Alice,1,
