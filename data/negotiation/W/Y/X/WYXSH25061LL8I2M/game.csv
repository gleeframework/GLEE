"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's meet in the middle!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me.",10250.0,Bob,4,
