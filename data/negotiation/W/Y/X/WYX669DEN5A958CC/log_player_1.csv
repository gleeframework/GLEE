"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting high (significantly above both our valuations) gives us room to negotiate down and still achieve a great outcome. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help us understand how eager Bob is to purchase and how he values the product.  
* **Alternative Option:**  We keep in mind John's offer of $1,200,000 (our baseline). If Bob's counteroffers are too low, we can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,800,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is better than our fallback option (John's offer of $1,200,000), but we're still early in the negotiation.  We have room to push for a higher price. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we believe the product is worth more and are willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,600,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  We're aiming for a collaborative approach by proposing a price directly in the middle of our previous offer ($1,800,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,400,000).
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counteroffer keeps us well above our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) while still showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Time Consideration:** We have plenty of rounds left, so there's no need to rush. We'll continue to gauge Bob's responses and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating serious interest. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could push for more, there's a risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a great deal and avoids potential lost opportunity."
