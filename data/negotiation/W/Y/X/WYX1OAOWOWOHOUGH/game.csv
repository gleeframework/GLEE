"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget of around $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500 to make this deal work. This price reflects the product's value and ensures we both benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $11,000, and I'm willing to compromise further.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,500.  This way we both get a fair deal and can close this transaction.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
