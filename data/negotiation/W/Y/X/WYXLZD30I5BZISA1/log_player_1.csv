Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand you're at $1,050,000. While that's a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to accept it IF you can assure me this is your absolute final offer."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob stated his $1,050,000 offer was final.  It's risky to push further unless absolutely necessary.
* **Profitable Sale:** Even at $1,050,000, Alice is making a substantial profit over her minimum and John's offer. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  While rounds remain, prolonging negotiations unnecessarily risks Bob walking away entirely. 

**Strategy:**

Alice is aiming to close the deal NOW at a price still very favorable to her. By framing it as accepting his ""final offer,"" she puts the decision back on Bob without appearing overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not ready to commit to $1,050,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about exploring other options, so I hope we can come to an agreement soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shrinking Window:** Bob is clearly signaling his intent to walk away soon.  He's no longer presenting his offers as ""final,"" but his patience is wearing thin.
* **Respectful Profit:**  $1,000,000 is still a significant profit for Alice. It's double what John is offering and a healthy return on her minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Pushing further risks losing Bob entirely.  While Alice *might* get more in later rounds, the potential gain isn't worth the very real risk of dropping to $800,000 if Bob walks.

**It's time for Alice to secure the deal while it's still good.**"
