"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has the potential to be incredibly valuable, as we both know.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,200,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,050,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand you're at $1,050,000. While that's a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to accept it IF you can assure me this is your absolute final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not ready to commit to $1,050,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about exploring other options, so I hope we can come to an agreement soon.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
