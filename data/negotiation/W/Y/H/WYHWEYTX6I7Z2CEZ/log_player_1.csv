Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $950,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,025,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet at $975,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly above our minimum sale price and have room to negotiate. We want to incentivize him to meet us closer to our initial offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,000,000.  How about $1,010,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product and is my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to move significantly closer to our $1,000,000+ desired price point. Accepting his offer of $985,000 secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
