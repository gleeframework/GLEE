Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the value I've assessed, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  This would be a good starting point for us to work from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
