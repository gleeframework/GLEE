"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows for that negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the value I've assessed, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  This would be a good starting point for us to work from."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is substantial and I can't accept a price as low as $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to bring the price down further.  Rejecting the offer allows for more rounds of negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. Let's split the difference and see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While  $1,275,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to get at least $1,300,000 for this product. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made her final offer of $1,300,000.  While Bob would prefer a lower price, this is still a good deal for him.  It's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,500,000 and within Bob's budget.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
