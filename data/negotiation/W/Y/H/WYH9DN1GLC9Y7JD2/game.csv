"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the value I've assessed, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  This would be a good starting point for us to work from.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is substantial and I can't accept a price as low as $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. Let's split the difference and see if we can come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While  $1,275,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to get at least $1,300,000 for this product. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
