# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* This means you'll save $100,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though the product is only worth $1,000,000 to Alice, you are still getting a good deal."
