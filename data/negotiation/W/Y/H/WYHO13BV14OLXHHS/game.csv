"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500.

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9500? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10200. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8000. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer!",10200.0,Alice,5,
