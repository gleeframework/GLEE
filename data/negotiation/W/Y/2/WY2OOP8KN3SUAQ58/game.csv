"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,200,000 is a little steep. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
