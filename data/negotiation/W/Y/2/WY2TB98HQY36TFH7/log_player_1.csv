{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. I think it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, giving him room to negotiate.  It also includes a friendly message to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $85. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob,  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $87? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $87 is less than what you initially hoped for, it's still higher than Bob's initial valuation and is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's not worth risking losing the sale to John for a few more dollars."
