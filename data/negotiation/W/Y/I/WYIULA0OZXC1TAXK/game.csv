"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $130. Would you be willing to consider $130 as a compromise?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm open to finding a middle ground, $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This price is fair considering the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little bit away from where I need to be. Let's split the difference once more, and I'll accept $137.50. It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",137.5,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can get even closer. How about $135.75?",135.75,Bob,8,
