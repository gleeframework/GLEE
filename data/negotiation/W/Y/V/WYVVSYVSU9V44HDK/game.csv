"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $105? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell for $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
