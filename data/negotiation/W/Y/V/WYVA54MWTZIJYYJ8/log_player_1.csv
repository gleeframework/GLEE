Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value leaves room for potential counter-offers, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Backup Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net, allowing Alice to confidently aim higher with Bob."
