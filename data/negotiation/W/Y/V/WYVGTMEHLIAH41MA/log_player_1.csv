``` 
The deal with Bob for $1,575,000 is slightly better than selling to John for $1,500,000, and it's likely that if we reject this offer, we'll either get a counteroffer at $1,575,000 or will have to sell to John. There are only three rounds left and it's not worth risking losing the deal for a minimal increase in price."
