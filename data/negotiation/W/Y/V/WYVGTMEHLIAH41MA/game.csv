"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. Is that something we could discuss?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $1,500,000 is simply too low for me at this time. However, I'm willing to come down slightly. I'd accept $1,650,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $1,550,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $1,600,000? I believe this price reflects the product's value while remaining fair for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not at $1,600,000. How about $1,575,000? I think that's a fair price for the product.",1575000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but we're getting close to the end of our rounds. I'm willing to meet you halfway this time, but I'm firm on the price.  $1,587,500 is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",1587500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,575,000. However, I'm willing to make a concession to sweeten the deal - I'll pay the full price upfront. I think this is a fair offer, and I'm hoping you'll accept it.",1575000.0,Bob,8,
