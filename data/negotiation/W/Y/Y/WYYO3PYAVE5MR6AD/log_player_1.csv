Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **My Value:** I value the product at $10,000.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000.
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him a small discount while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum.

This approach aims to maximize my profit while still having a good chance of Bob accepting the offer."
