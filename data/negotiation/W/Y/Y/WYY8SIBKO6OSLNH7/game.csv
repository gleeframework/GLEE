"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $19,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",19000.0,Bob,4,
