,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to $1350000. This is a fair compromise, allowing you to acquire the product while ensuring I receive a reasonable return. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1250000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price slightly further to $1300000.  This is a fair price that considers both of our positions. Let's make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you are pushing for a lower price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1280000. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, at $1290000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let's close this now.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
