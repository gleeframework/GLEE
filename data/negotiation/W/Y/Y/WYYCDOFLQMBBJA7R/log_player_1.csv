"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can make a decent profit, but I also want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. There's still room to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,400,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to give away the product for his initial offer."

Round 5

{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise,  a significant step down from my previous offer, but I'm still confident I can secure a good profit.  This is a good test to see how much more Bob is willing to pay."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm confident that I can still get a better price, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push him further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1325000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,325,000. This is another small concession, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds. If Bob rejects this, I'm going to have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good offer. It's above my minimum, and I'm running out of time. While I would have liked to get closer to my original asking price, accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoid the risk of having to sell to John for less."
