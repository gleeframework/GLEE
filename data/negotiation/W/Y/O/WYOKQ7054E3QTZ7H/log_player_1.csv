Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start with a higher asking price.
* **Room for negotiation:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than your minimum. 
* **Value justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly list the benefits, it emphasizes that the price is a ""fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."" This subtly implies that the product is worth the higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perspective:**  You don't know how much Bob is willing to pay *above* his perceived value. There's a chance he'll reject a price significantly higher than $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation skills:** Your success in getting a higher price depends on your ability to negotiate effectively with Bob if he counters."
