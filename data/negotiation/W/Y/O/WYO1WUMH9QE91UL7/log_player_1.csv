"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $100 is the highest he's willing to go, and it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  There's no point in further negotiation, as it's unlikely I'll get a better offer from him. John provides a guaranteed sale at my desired price."
