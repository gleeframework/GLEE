"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more from my initial offer.  How about $110? That gives us both a good deal. ",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to close this deal, but I'm only able to go up to $108.  Is there any way you could meet me halfway?",108.0,Bob,4,
