"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This recognizes the product's value while still offering you a substantial gain.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me halfway?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a fair price.  To show you I'm flexible too, let's try $825,000. It's a small adjustment, but reflects the significant value this product brings.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value.  Let's split the difference and make this a done deal - I'll come down to $800,000 even.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,7,
