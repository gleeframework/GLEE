"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $75? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested but $85 is still a little high for me.  How about $82?  I think that's a fair price, considering we're both trying to get a good deal here.",82.0,Bob,4,
