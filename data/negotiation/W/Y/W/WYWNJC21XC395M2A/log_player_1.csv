Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. I think it's a fair price given its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90, which is slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives him some room to negotiate, but also leaves me with a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $75? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $75 is better than nothing, it is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested but $85 is still a little high for me.  How about $82?  I think that's a fair price, considering we're both trying to get a good deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $82 is slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only lead to further back-and-forth and potentially a lower offer from Bob.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product."
