"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2000000.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $2000000 is significantly higher than my current budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product, given its potential benefits to me. This is a fair and realistic price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to $1400000, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still beyond my comfort zone.  I'm confident that this product has value for me, but I can't justify going above $1200000 at this time. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm ready to proceed. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1400000 and $1200000, which would be $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
