``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get the best possible price. I'm also being friendly and confident to encourage him to accept the offer. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum goal of $8,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can find a compromise that benefits us both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to reach my target while still giving you a good value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages him to accept the offer. If he still rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John to ensure I don't lose out on my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to propose $7,500. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has come up a bit, $7,500 is still below my minimum desired price of $8,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate further. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $8,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price a little further to $8,250. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. If you're truly serious about buying this product, I believe this is the best offer you'll get."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

I'm offering a slight reduction from my previous counteroffer to show good faith and willingness to compromise. This price is still above my minimum desired price of $8,000, but it's getting closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows him that I'm serious about selling to him, but also that I won't settle for a price that is significantly lower than my product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to be fair, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $7,800. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping you can meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm disappointed that we couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, I've realized that I've reached a point where I'm unwilling to go any lower than my minimum desired price of $8,000. Bob's last offer is just below that, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $8,000 from John.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000."
