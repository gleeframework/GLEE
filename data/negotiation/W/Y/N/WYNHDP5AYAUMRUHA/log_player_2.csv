"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $100. Alice's offer is $95, which is still more than you want to pay.  You can get it from John for $100, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
