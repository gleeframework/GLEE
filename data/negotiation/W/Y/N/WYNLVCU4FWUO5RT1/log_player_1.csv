Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on $10,300. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's settle on $10,337.50.  This gives us both a little bit of what we want, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10337.50}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the 8th round of negotiation, and although Bob is offering a higher price than before, it's still not reaching my minimum acceptable price of $10,375.  We are getting close, but I'm running out of time and negotiation rounds. To secure a sale above my minimum price, I'll choose to sell to John for $12,000. It's a better outcome for me than accepting Bob's latest offer."
