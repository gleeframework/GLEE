Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing my minimum acceptable price is $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting me closer to my minimum.
* **Higher than Bob's Value:** While the price is higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), it's presented as a ""deal,"" potentially swaying him.
* **Backup Option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to balance profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
