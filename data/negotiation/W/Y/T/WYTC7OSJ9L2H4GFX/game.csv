"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $800,000 is significantly lower than what I have in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
