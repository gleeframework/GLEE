,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that much, but I'm not sure if it's worth more than that to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $9,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $11,000 to me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
