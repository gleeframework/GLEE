"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering its value and the effort I put into acquiring it. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and offer $15500. This is the absolute most I can offer for the product, so I hope we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
