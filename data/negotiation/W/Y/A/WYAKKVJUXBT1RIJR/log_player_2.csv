"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get an even lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. This counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a strong starting point, as it's halfway between Alice's desired price of $1,000,000 and Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,200,000. While there's always the possibility of further negotiation, the potential gains are minimal. Accepting the offer secures the product at a favorable price."
