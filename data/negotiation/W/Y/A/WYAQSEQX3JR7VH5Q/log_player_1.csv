Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, knowing that the product is worth at least $8,000 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive and Enthusiastic:**  My message is friendly and positive, hoping to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I don't want to appear too inflexible, so I don't state a firm ""this is my final offer""  I'm open to hearing what Bob thinks. 

**Strategy:** 

I'm taking a calculated risk by starting high. If Bob immediately rejects, I can always go down to John's offer of $8,000. However, if Bob is interested but thinks the price is too high, he'll counteroffer, giving me a chance to negotiate and potentially earn more than $8,000."
