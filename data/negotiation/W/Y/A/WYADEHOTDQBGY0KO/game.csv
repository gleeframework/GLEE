"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and what I'm willing to pay for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $950,000 falls short of what I'm looking for.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still valuing the product highly, but I'm trying to be reasonable here. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,025,000 is getting closer, but I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you be open to $1,037,500? I believe this represents a small concession on my end while acknowledging the product's worth.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
