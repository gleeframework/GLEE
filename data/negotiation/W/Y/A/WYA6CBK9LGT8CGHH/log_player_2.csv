"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $100 is within his budget, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows him to start the counter-offer process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, but also wants to be reasonable and avoid a stalemate.  Offering $90 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for her to make a profit.  This counteroffer should encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, $105 is still too high for Bob. He's aiming for a price closer to $90, which is still a good deal for both parties.  Rejecting the offer again keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob the opportunity to make another counteroffer.  He has time on his side, as he has 7 rounds remaining before having to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer. He believes he can still get the price down further, but doesn't want to push Alice too far. By offering $95, he is demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still attempting to secure a favorable deal.  He's also keeping in mind that if Alice rejects this offer, he can always counter-offer again in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still too high for Bob. He is determined to get the price down further and sees value in continuing the negotiation.  He has 5 rounds left before having to buy from John, and his counteroffer in the next round will likely push Alice closer to his target price.  He is still confident that he can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is approaching the halfway point of the negotiation and wants to show Alice that he's serious about getting a deal done. Increasing his offer to $98 demonstrates his flexibility and willingness to compromise. He's confident that Alice will find this offer more appealing than her previous offer of $110.  He is also taking into account that he only has 4 rounds remaining before needing to buy from John, and wants to ensure a deal is reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get a better price. While Alice's offer is lower than her previous ones, it is still too high. With only 3 rounds remaining, Bob needs to be strategic.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer in the next round, potentially pushing Alice closer to his target price.  He needs to ensure he gets the best possible deal before the time runs out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a crucial round. With only two rounds remaining, Bob needs to close the deal without resorting to buying from John. He's increasing his offer to $100, showing Alice that he's willing to compromise.  He's also factoring in that Alice's offer of $115 is still higher than her initial offer, so there's potential for a deal within his desired price range. This offer creates a win-win scenario, with Alice getting a higher price than her initial $80 value and Bob getting a lower price than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to get a deal with Alice.  While $118 is only slightly lower than buying from John, it's still a better price than the previous offers. He's unlikely to get a significantly lower price from Alice in the final round, and buying from John would be more expensive.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product while saving a few dollars.  Even though it's not his ideal price, it's the best available option in this scenario."
