"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a starting price of $1,150,000.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he could pay to John. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth significantly more than your offer. I could come down to $1,120,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but it's still above Bob's budget. John is offering the same product for a lower price, which is a better deal for Bob.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point."
