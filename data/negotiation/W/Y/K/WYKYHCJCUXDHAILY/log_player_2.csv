"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details further. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than what you can get it for from John ($15,000). By rejecting her offer, you create the opportunity to negotiate a lower price or ultimately buy it from John for a guaranteed lower price."
