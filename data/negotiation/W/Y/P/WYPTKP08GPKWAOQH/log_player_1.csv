{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, aiming to make him more inclined to accept.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This offer gives Bob some space to negotiate, making him more likely to engage in a back-and-forth.

**Note:** This is just the initial offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and counteroffers, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and the potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and its worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  While it's closer than his initial perceived value, I'm not willing to sell for that amount.
* **I have a backup option with John.** Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price, so I have leverage to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **There's room for further negotiations.** I can likely get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the significant value this product holds, while still allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm on my minimum:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Offering a compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still within my acceptable range. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not to compromise my bottom line.
* **Reinforcing the value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to emphasize its worth and justify my price.

This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price, but I'm also flexible enough to work towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for your flexibility. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000 for your product. This price is higher than my initial offer but still within my budget. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $150,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of losing a better deal:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away. Selling to John guarantees my minimum price, but I'm not sure if John is still interested.
* **A good compromise:**  $1,350,000 is a good middle ground and a reasonable compromise.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale with a price that's close to my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
