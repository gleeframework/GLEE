"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm setting the initial price at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is a better price than John's $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  This would still be a good deal for you as it's above your stated value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would be a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's price:** $1,100,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will become unwilling to negotiate further, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 

By accepting the offer, Bob secures a good deal while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
