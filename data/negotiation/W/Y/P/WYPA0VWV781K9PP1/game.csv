"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $150.  What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm still willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $125 is still a bit high.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $112.50.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and your persistence. $112.50 is still a bit too low, but I'm willing to go down a little further. How about we settle on $115? This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm happy to see you're coming down in price, $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  If that works for you, let's make this happen.",110.0,Bob,6,
