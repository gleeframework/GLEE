"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and even lower than the product's value to her ($1,000,000). It's worth trying to negotiate a better price.  You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well above your valuation and leaves room for a profitable transaction. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $900,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and still leaves some room for profit for Alice.  It's a better deal than buying from John, so accepting this offer is the best option."
