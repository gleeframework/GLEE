"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $95 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,90.0
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can do $90, but that's as low as I can go.",90.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $87.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,92.5
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. That way, I can still make a bit of a profit, but we can meet in the middle.",92.5,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but $92.50 is still a bit high.  Let's meet in the middle at $89.50.  That way, we both get a fair price.",89.5,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,92.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I think $89.50 is still a bit low for me. I can do $92, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",92.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's split the difference one more time and settle on $91.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.",91.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,94.0
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $94. It's the lowest price I can offer and still make a decent profit.",94.0,Alice,9,,
