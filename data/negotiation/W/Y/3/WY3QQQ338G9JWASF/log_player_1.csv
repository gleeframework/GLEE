Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with my highest possible price. I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay that much, even though it's more than it's worth to him. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if he rejects, but I want to see if I can get my full asking price first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this price is attractive enough to Bob to make a deal, but it's still high enough to ensure I get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my minimum acceptable price, it's getting closer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. I'm confident that I can find another buyer in the future who will be willing to pay my full asking price."
