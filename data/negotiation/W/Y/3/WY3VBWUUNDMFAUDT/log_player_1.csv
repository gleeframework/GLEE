"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $170. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is already at his maximum valuation of the product ($120).  There's no room for negotiation to get a better price from him. Since John offers my minimum acceptable price ($120), it's best to sell to John and avoid further negotiation rounds."
