"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $107.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107.50 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $109.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested!",109.0,Alice,5,
