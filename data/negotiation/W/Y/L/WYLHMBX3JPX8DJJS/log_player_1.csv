Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for negotiation because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  You value the product at $15,000, so you're leaving room to negotiate.
* **It's close to your backup plan:** You have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so you're not taking a huge risk.

By offering this price, you give Bob a reason to negotiate, but you still have a solid backup plan."
