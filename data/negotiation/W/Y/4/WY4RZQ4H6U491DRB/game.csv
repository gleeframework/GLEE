"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $18000 for it. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll see the value in it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I'm very interested, but my budget is limited. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints.  However, $10000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $15000, which is a fair compromise. This price still allows me to make a decent profit while offering you a competitive price.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $12500. This seems to be a reasonable compromise for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
