Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly lower might raise suspicion and leave money on the table.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential return on investment"" aims to frame the price in a positive light, even if it's higher than Bob's initial valuation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, allowing for potential negotiation down towards his $800,000 valuation, but still leaving Alice the possibility to walk away with a profit.
* **Backup plan:**  Knowing John will purchase the product for $1,500,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the potential for negotiation and leveraging the security of a guaranteed sale."
