"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than $120, Bob can still get the product for $80 from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer when a better option is available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price and knows he can get the product for $80 from John. This counteroffer directly reflects that price, putting the pressure on Alice to either accept and make a small profit or reject and risk losing the sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still higher than what Bob can get from John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice as the price is unlikely to drop further, and Bob can secure the product at his desired price immediately by going to John."
