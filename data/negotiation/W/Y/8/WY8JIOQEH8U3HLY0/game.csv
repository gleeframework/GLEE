"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price is in line with what I'm comfortable spending, and I'm confident it's a fair offer for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is outside your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to pay $850,000. However, I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reflects the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid to $950,000. However, I'm still not ready to accept. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reflects the product's worth. I'm getting closer to your offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
