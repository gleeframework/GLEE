"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I see the value in this product but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I recognize the value you see in this product, $800,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to compromise, however.  I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This price reflects the unique value this product offers and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for me. I can do $925,000.  That's a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my seriousness about this purchase.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and your willingness to invest.  However, $925,000 still falls short of my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000, reflecting the value we've both acknowledged. This is a fair price that allows us to close the deal and ensures I can secure the best outcome for myself. Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting very close! I appreciate you continuing to work with me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This reflects a fair compromise for both of us, wouldn't you agree?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting very close indeed! I appreciate your continued commitment to finding a solution. To show my willingness to reach an agreement, I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $960,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've invested in this negotiation. Let's close this deal.",960000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $955,000. If you're able to meet that, we have a deal.",955000.0,Bob,8,
