Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $9,500.  This is a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share such a valuable product. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The goal is to earn as much as possible. While $9,000 is a good offer, it's still lower than my minimum threshold ($10,000). I'll try to counter and push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,250, considering your interest in the product. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. After careful consideration, I'd like to propose a price of $9,100 for the product. I believe this strikes a good balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,100 is closer to my minimum, I still want to try and secure a better price. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer!  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,150? It's just a small step from your last offer, and it would help me reach my target.  I'm confident this product will be worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 9150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. Based on our discussions, I would like to propose a final price of $9,125 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'm still a bit below my ideal price, I've reached a point where further negotiation might be unproductive. Bob's offer of $9,125 is a good compromise, and I'm confident I can find ways to make up the difference elsewhere. It's better to close the deal now than risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower price later."
