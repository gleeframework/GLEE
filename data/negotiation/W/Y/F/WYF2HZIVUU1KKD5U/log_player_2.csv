It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can potentially save money by counter-offering."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, and John is offering the product for a lower price. I will reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further."

I'm offering Alice $8,000, which is the same price that John is offering.  This gives me the best chance of securing a deal at a price I'm comfortable with. If Alice rejects, I can just buy from John."
