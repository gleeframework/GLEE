"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to someone in your position. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a bit too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $11,000?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation and signal that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's time while clearly stating our target price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer positions us well. If Alice accepts, we get a great price. If she counters, we have room to negotiate upwards while staying below our $15,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is quite a bit below its value. Could you meet me halfway at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:**  $12,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's halfway between our initial offer and Alice's original price.
* **Savings:**  This price saves us $2,500 compared to buying from John.
* **Time Value:** Further negotiation might not yield much better results, and it risks Alice walking away from the deal. Accepting now secures the product at a good price."
