"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, as it aligns better with my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting close!  I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,000,000 even? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
