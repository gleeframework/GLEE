"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's lower than John's price, it still leaves room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, as it aligns better with my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than what Bob is comfortable with.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting allows Bob to try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting close!  I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,000,000 even? This feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and $1,000,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than John's price and allows Bob to save $200,000.  There's no guarantee that Bob will get a better offer if he rejects and continues negotiating, and he risks losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether."
