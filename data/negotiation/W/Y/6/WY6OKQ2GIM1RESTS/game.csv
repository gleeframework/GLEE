"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value it holds for you and my original asking price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
