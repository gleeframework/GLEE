Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it.

This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value it holds for you and my original asking price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
