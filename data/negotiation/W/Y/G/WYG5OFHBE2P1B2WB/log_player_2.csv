"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1000000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially when the seller is offering the product at your maximum price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counteroffer:**  A significant discount (25%) is a strong starting point. It shows Alice you're serious about buying but also that you're not willing to pay full price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation. Depending on Alice's response, I can adjust my offer accordingly.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping the option to buy from John at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. If Alice rejects the offer, I can still secure the product, but at a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This still reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still a higher price than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to try to negotiate further.  There's still room to find a price that's better for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it reflects the product's value while being within my budget."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer finds a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest price. It shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Finality:**  Stating that this is my final offer creates a sense of urgency. It might encourage Alice to accept, especially if she's concerned about losing the deal.
* **Confidence:**  Highlighting the value of the product while staying within my budget strengthens my position and adds to the sense of fairness."
