Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $145. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 
 
Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($120). Offering it at $145 aims to capture the most profit possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, the offer leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to haggle, potentially leading to a still-profitable outcome for you. 
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):** By mentioning a ""great deal,"" you subtly imply that this offer might not last forever, encouraging Bob to act quickly rather than overthinking it."
