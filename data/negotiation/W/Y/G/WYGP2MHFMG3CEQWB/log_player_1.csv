Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6

}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are escalating slowly. At this point, the difference between his offer ($780,000) and John's standing offer ($800,000) is quite small. It's not worth the risk of Bob's offer not reaching a satisfactory amount within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees a price very close to Bob's latest offer and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
