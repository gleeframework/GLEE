Alice's offer is still too high. While it's better than her first offer, I can still try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $13,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's aim for a quick and mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}

# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to my target, I can still try to negotiate a lower price. I'm confident I can get it down to $13,000 or even a bit lower.  I'm not desperate to buy from Alice and can always go to John if I have to."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $13,500, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'll offer the product to you for $14,250. This is the last concession I'm willing to make, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not willing to go above $13,500. I believe I can still convince her to come down just a little bit more. If she rejects my next offer, I'm ready to buy from John."

Round 9

# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $13,500. I'll make one final offer: I'll sell the product to you for $14,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my target price, and we're running out of rounds.  It's getting risky to continue negotiating, as I may end up paying more than I'm willing to. It's time to take the safe option and buy from John."
