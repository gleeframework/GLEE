"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $13000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $13500 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're willing to go up to $12500, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $12500, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,7,
