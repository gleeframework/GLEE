"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can't afford $9,500 at this time. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I know the product is worth more to Bob and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,000?  This would still give you a good deal while allowing me to get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,750. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,750 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe that I can get more, especially since Bob has shown his willingness to negotiate. I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. How about $8,900?  It's a small difference, but it would help me out significantly.  I'm feeling optimistic that we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I am willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. My counteroffer is $8,800. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price,  $8,800 is a good deal, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's significantly better than selling to John, and it ensures I close the deal."
