Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get more than $100.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if it's just implying added value, can make Bob more receptive.
* **Gauge Interest:** By offering it to Bob first, you're gauging his interest and potentially securing a slightly higher sale price. If he rejects it, you haven't lost anything, as you have John as a backup."
