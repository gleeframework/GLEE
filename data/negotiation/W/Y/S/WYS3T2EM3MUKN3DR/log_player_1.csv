"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value of $80 and leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob is willing to pay this price, and if not, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to try to get a little more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

I'm going to counter with $87. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price without pushing Bob away entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 84}
```

I'm going to counter with $84.  This is a smaller increment than before, showing that I'm willing to come down in price but still aiming for a good deal. We're getting close to an agreement, and I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $81
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $81 is very close to my minimum value of $80. While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. I'm concerned about running out of rounds and being forced to sell to John for $80, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
