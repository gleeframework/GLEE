"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $18,000 is above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,500 for the product. Can we discuss the details further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $16,500 is still above Bob's maximum price of $15,000. Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price, keeping in mind that he has the option to buy from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $16,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to pay $15,500, which is a fair compromise and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  While further negotiation might be possible, there is a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers, and Bob is running out of rounds. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John for his maximum price of $15,000."
