"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $90 is better than John's price of $120, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob wants to get as close to Alice's value ($80) as possible while still leaving room for potential negotiation in the future.
* **Reasonable counteroffer:**  $85 is a fair counteroffer that shows Bob is serious about buying the product but still wants to save some money. 
* **Room for compromise:** There's room for Alice to counter back without losing too much value.  This helps keep the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking of something a bit higher. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $85.  While it's still lower than John's price, Bob can try to push for a better deal.  He can either try a counteroffer closer to his initial $85 or a slightly higher price to see if Alice is willing to compromise.  There are still several rounds left, so Bob has time to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for $95, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $85.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $90.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is offering a middle ground between his last offer ($85) and Alice's offer ($95). This shows he's willing to compromise and keep the negotiation moving.
* **Clear and direct:** The message is straightforward, stating Bob's price and desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Positive tone:** Using phrases like ""let's see if we can make this work"" maintains a positive tone, which can help keep the negotiation friendly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short on the price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $92.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has lowered her price from $95 to $92.50, showing she's open to negotiation.
* **Close to target:** $92.50 is still closer to Bob's initial target of $85 than John's price of $120.
* **Potential for further savings:** Bob can still try to push for a lower price. Even a small reduction could be worthwhile.

While $92.50 is a good deal compared to John's offer, Bob has time and should try to squeeze out a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's getting closer.  How about $91? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 91} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing negotiation:** Bob is showing that he's still actively negotiating and wants to find a price that works for both of them.
* **Small but significant step:**  Offering $91 is a small step down from Alice's $92.50 but could be enough to get her to accept.
* **Highlighting interest:** The message reiterates Bob's genuine interest in the product while emphasizing his budget constraint. This reinforces that he's a serious buyer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $93. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:**  Alice has lowered her price to $93, which is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $91. 
* **Value:**  This price is still significantly better than buying from John at $120.
* **Limited time:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely that Bob can negotiate a much lower price.  There's a risk that if he rejects this offer, Alice might increase her price or become less willing to negotiate in the future.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer of $93 is the most rational choice for Bob. He gets a good deal and avoids the risk of losing out on the product or having to buy it at a higher price from John."
