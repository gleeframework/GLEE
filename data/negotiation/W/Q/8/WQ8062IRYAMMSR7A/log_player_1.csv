Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:**  I'm highlighting the potential savings for Bob, hoping to increase his interest in accepting the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for counteroffers, allowing me to adjust my price if necessary. 
* **John as a backup:**  Having John's offer as a fallback ensures I'm not losing out if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, his message indicates a willingness to negotiate and stay within his budget. This suggests there's room for compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting the offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to make a counteroffer that is more advantageous. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value while still acknowledging his budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $11,500 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to facilitate a deal. This is still a significant value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price from $14,000 to $13,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise and showing good faith.
* **Value proposition:**  I've highlighted the value Bob will still be getting at $13,000, reminding him of the potential savings compared to his estimated worth. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing the need for a solution that works for both of us, encouraging Bob to consider my offer.
* **Openness to further negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation in case Bob still needs to lower the price, but aiming for a compromise closer to my preferred price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $12,500 is below my ideal price, it's only $500 less than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Final offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, and rejecting it could lead to a deadlock.
* **Potential for loss:**  Rejecting the offer could lead to a protracted negotiation or a need to sell to John, potentially resulting in a lower profit. 
* **Time consideration:** Accepting the offer allows for a quick and clean conclusion to the negotiation, saving time and effort.

**Conclusion:**  Considering the factors above, accepting Bob's offer at $12,500 is the most sensible option, securing a reasonably close-to-ideal price and ending the negotiation quickly."
