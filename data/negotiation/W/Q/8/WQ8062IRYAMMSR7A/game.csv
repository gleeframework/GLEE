"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $11,500 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to facilitate a deal. This is still a significant value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
