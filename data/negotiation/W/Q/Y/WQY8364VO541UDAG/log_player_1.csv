"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $150. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating I'm open to negotiation to make Bob feel comfortable with the possibility of counteroffering. 
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language like ""amazing"" and ""love"" to try to create a positive impression and build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. Based on my budget, I am willing to pay $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my absolute minimum of $150, it's significantly lower than my desired starting point.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob!  I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $160?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price of $160, which is exactly in the middle of our two previous offers.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm thanking Bob for his counteroffer and reinforcing his interest in the product.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly highlighting the value of the product by saying ""I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny."" This aims to make him feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $140 for the product. This allows us to stay within my budget while still acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $140 is only $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Given that we're already on round 4,  I'm willing to accept this offer to close the deal and avoid potentially losing more time and ultimately having to settle for John's $150 offer."
