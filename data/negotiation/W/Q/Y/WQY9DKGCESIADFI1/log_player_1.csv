Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the higher asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, you signal that you're open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $12,000, he doesn't know your minimum price.  This puts you in a strong negotiating position.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  A higher starting price carries the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. However, it also presents the opportunity for a significantly higher profit."
