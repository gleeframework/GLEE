After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and I believe you'll find it a good value.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. It's unlikely she'll go below $800,000, which is John's price.  At this point, it's better to cut your losses and buy from John to secure the $800,000 price."
