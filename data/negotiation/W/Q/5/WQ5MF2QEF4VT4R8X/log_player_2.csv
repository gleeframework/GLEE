"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $12,000 to ensure we both benefit from this transaction. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. While her message is friendly, it's important to negotiate to try and get closer to my $10,000 limit.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we aim for $10,500 for the product? This still keeps a reasonable profit margin for me while being more accessible for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, but I'm still better off buying from John at $10,000. I'll reject this offer to signal I'm looking for something closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we meet in the middle at $9,750?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

This counteroffer does a few things:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** Moving from $9,000 to $9,750 demonstrates I'm flexible.
* **Keeps the pressure on Alice:** It's still significantly below her desired price, encouraging her to move further.
* **Leaves room for a final push:** If needed, I can slightly increase my offer in later rounds while staying below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering our previous discussions, how about we settle on $10,250 for the product? This offers a good balance between what we're both comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,250. While I could try to haggle a bit more, it's not worth the risk of her retracting the offer altogether.  At this point, buying from John for $10,000 is the most financially sound decision."
