"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for 140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident I'd get good use out of the product.",100.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  I'm sticking to my offer of $100. If you're not willing to come down that far, I'm going to have to consider other options.",100.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my price point, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $100.  If you don't want to accept that, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",100.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than 110. It's the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,9,
