"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low.  How about we split the difference at $112.50? This would be a good deal for both of us.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $112.50 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's meet in the middle.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $110 is still not quite there for me. How about we settle on $115? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
