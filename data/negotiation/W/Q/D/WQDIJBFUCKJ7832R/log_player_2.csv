"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  This counter-offer gives ample room for Alice to counter, and for us to potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counter-offer will give us an idea of Alice's flexibility and how low she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $9,000. It's a great price, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down $2,000, the price is still $1,000 more than John's offer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting this offer shows Alice we're serious about a lower price and keeps the pressure on her to negotiate further. 
* **Approaching the Walk-Away Point:**  We're getting closer to the price where it might be more sensible to buy from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for moving on the price. I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a little ways off on what I can afford. How about $7,000? That would work much better for me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** We're increasing our offer by $1,000, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate seriously.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer puts us in a strong position. 
    * If Alice accepts, we get a great deal at $1,000 less than John.
    * If she rejects, we can consider moving closer to John's price or walking away in the next round. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiations, and need to start pushing for a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $8,200. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Difference:** Alice is only offering $200 less than her previous offer, and it's still more than John's price. 
* **Final Push:**  We're close to John's price, and Alice might be willing to go even lower if we reject this offer.
* **Alternative Ready:** We have John as a backup, so there's minimal risk in rejecting this offer and seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to make a deal, but I can only do $7,500.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This offer is a strong signal to Alice that we're serious about buying but need her to meet us closer to John's price.
* **Middle Ground:**  It splits the difference between our last offer and her current one, aiming for a potential compromise.
* **Time Sensitivity:** With fewer rounds left, we need to push for a decision while still aiming for the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,200 and $7,500. How about we try $7,850? It's a compromise, but I think it's fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice is offering the product for $150 less than John's price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Time Factor:** With only a few rounds left, continuing to negotiate for a small potential saving isn't worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. 
* **Saving Money:**  While not the absolute lowest we could get, this price is still a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer."
