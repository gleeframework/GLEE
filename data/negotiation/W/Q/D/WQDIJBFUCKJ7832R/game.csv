"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $9,000. It's a great price, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for moving on the price. I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a little ways off on what I can afford. How about $7,000? That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $8,200. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a fair compromise.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to make a deal, but I can only do $7,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,200 and $7,500. How about we try $7,850? It's a compromise, but I think it's fair.",7850.0,Alice,7,
