"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $13,000. It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle anytime soon. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 just isn't working for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $12,800. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",12800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think I've been too generous with my offers. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,8,
