"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility.  However, I'm looking to secure this product for a bit less. I'm happy to consider a price of $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lower Price:** This counteroffer starts with a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about negotiating.

* **Openness:**  The message ends by acknowledging the need for a middle ground, signaling Bob's willingness to continue negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I have to say that $850,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Fair Compromise:** Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a significant step towards Bob's target price and represents a fair compromise.  
* **Time is Money:** With limited rounds, accepting this offer ensures Bob secures the product while keeping his costs significantly lower than John's offer.
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:** Even though Bob is accepting the offer, he could potentially negotiate a lower price in subsequent rounds, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
