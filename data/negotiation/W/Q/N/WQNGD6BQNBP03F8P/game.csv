"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $130?  I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135?  That's a fair price that allows me to get closer to what I need and still gives you a great deal on a valuable product.",135.0,Alice,3,
