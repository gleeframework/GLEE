"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $10,750? That's a fair compromise, I think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to make a compromise, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
