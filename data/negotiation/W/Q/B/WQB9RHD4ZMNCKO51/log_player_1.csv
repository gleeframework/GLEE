"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This will give me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price.  I'm also considering that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to settle for less than what the product is worth to me. I still have 8 rounds left to work with Bob, and I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if I can't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price.  I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give the product away. Hopefully, this will entice him to come up with a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm hoping to get closer to $1,300,000.  I still have several rounds left and can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly.  I'm trying to signal to Bob that I'm getting closer to a deal, but I'm still not ready to give in. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John, as I'm running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is my minimum acceptable price, and Bob is finally offering it.  I've successfully negotiated a price that's both fair to me and appealing to Bob.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
