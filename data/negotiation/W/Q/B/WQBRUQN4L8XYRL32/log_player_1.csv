Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation or a potential sale at a price exceeding your minimum.
* **Bob's Valuation:** While Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his valuation."
