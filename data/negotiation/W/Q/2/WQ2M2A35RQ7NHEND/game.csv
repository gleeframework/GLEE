"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000 for the product.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000 for the product. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 was still a bit too high for you, and $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 was still a bit too high for you, and $8,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not getting the price I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $9,250 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can meet at this price.",9250.0,Alice,7,
