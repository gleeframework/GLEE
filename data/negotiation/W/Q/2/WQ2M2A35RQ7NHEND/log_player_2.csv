Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000 for the product. Let me know if that's more to your liking.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 was still a bit too high for you, and $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 was still a bit too high for you, and $8,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not getting the price I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $9,250 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can meet at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $9,000.  You can get the product for a guaranteed $8,000 from John, which is a better deal for you."
