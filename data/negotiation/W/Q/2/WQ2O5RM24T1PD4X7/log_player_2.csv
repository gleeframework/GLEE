"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. How about $140? It's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $140, which is less than what John is asking ($150).
* **You're still saving money:** While you'd prefer to pay less, you're still getting a good deal by accepting Alice's offer and saving $10 compared to buying from John."
