Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial discount compared to my guaranteed sale price. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's long-term value, subtly justifying the high price without revealing my alternative buyer or their offered price.

This strategy balances risk and potential reward. If Bob accepts, I make a significant profit. If he rejects it, I still have my guaranteed sale to John."
