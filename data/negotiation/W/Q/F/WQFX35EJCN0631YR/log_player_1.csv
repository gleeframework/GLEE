{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer aims to maximize my profit while remaining competitive.  I believe $11,000 is a fair price considering Bob's valuation.  However, I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a better deal closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $10,250?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and while I appreciate the gesture, I'm still not able to meet at $10,250. Would you consider $10,000 as a fair compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price John is willing to pay. While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and avoids further negotiation."
