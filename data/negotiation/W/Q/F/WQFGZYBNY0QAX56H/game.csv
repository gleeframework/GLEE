"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I need to make a profit. I can do $105, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's meet in the middle.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $98, which is closer to your offer, but still allows me to make a decent margin.",98.0,Alice,5,
