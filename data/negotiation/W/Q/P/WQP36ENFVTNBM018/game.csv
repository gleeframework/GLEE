"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  But $14,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm firm on $8,000.  It's my absolute maximum, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's work this out.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. I'm willing to make one more significant move to get this deal done. How about $11,000? This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down again. But I'm still sticking to my maximum of $8,000.  It's the absolute highest I can go.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value we both place on this product. I truly hope we can find a way to make this work.",8000.0,Bob,6,
