Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down again. But I'm still sticking to my maximum of $8,000.  It's the absolute highest I can go.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value we both place on this product. I truly hope we can find a way to make this work.

Bob is clearly fixed on his $8,000 offer and isn't budging.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap. Accepting his offer is a significant loss, and it's time to take John's guaranteed $12,000."
