# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10,000, which is a fair price considering its value to me and the value it has to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

While $10,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value it has to you and the value it has to me. I'm getting close to my minimum price, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

I'm still not comfortable with $9,500, even though it's a good price for both of us.  I will try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you're getting close to your minimum price, but $9,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,250, which I think is a good compromise. Let's seal this deal, and we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I can offer it to you for $9,500, but I'll throw in a small concession: I'll include a one-year warranty, which is a $500 value. This way, you'll get an even better deal, and I'll still be able to get a good price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is offering $9,000, which is closer to my budget but still above what I'm willing to pay. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I don't think I can get a better deal with Alice.  It's time to move on and buy the product from John for $8,000."
