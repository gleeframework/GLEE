Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential to earn more than your minimum sale price of $12,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still ensuring you get a significant profit.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John if Bob declines, giving you leverage."
