Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're getting close, but we're still leaving money on the table. It's worth another round of negotiation."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  I'm ready to close this deal soon. How about $810,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000.

Bob is clearly motivated and getting closer to our desired price. Accepting $810,000 secures a good profit and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer in subsequent rounds or the negotiations breaking down entirely."
