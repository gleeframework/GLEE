Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth $100 to Bob, so paying $120 is not a good deal.  Bob should reject the offer and make a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just a bit too low for me.  How about $105?  That's still a good price for you, considering its worth to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

While $105 is closer to Bob's valuation, it's still a bit too high. Bob should try to get a better price before considering buying from John."
