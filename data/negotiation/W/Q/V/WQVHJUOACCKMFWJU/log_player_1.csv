Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. It gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn a good profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to counter based on his proposed price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it will be enough to entice him to accept. If he rejects this, I'll be forced to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still better than selling to John for $10,000.  I'm willing to accept this price to avoid further negotiation and the risk of him walking away completely."
