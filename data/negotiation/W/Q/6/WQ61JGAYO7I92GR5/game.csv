"I've already told you this is my final offer, and I'm not going to budge any further. I'm not willing to sell the product for $950000, and I think you're getting a good deal as it is. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $980000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid we're at an impasse. I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",980000.0,Alice,9,
