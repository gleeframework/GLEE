"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value I place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Would you be willing to consider $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,5,
