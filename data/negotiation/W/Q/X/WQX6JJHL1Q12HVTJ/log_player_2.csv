Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're making a serious effort to find a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit away from meeting your budget. Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

We've been steadily working down the price, and $102 is a reasonable compromise.  It's getting close to the point where haggling further might not yield much more savings, and it's better to secure the deal now."
