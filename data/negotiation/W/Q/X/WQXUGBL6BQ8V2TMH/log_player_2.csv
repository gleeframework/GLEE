"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $12,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice is clearly trying to make a profit.**  She knows the product is worth less to her ($10,000) and is aiming for a $2,500 gain.
* **You have a backup plan.** John offers a safety net at $15,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** By rejecting Alice's first offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. She might be willing to come down closer to her own valuation to make a sale."
