"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1200000 to me, and I know it's equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1250000. This allows for a slight profit for me while still ensuring a good deal for you.  Let me know your thoughts!",1250000.0,Alice,1,
