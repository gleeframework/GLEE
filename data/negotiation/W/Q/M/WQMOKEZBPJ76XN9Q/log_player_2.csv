"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price, aiming to get a good discount.  $12,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it leaves room for both parties to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his preferred price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer from $12,000 to $14,000, showing that he's willing to negotiate but still wants a price closer to his preferred value. This offers a decent middle ground between his previous counteroffer and Alice's current price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still above his preferred price.  Bob can try one more counteroffer to see if he can secure a lower price, potentially reaching an agreement within his budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a final counteroffer at his absolute maximum budget of $15,000. This is a strong negotiating point, as it demonstrates Bob's seriousness while still being a fair price to Alice.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can confidently buy from John for the same price."
