"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $750,000. This is a limited-time offer, and I believe it presents a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get a better price than $750,000, so it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $700,000. This reflects a middle ground between our initial offers. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $700,000 is a good compromise. You've already managed to knock down the price significantly from her initial offer of $750,000.  It's better than the $800,000 price from John, so accepting Alice's offer is the best decision at this point."
