"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $700,000. This reflects a middle ground between our initial offers. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.",700000.0,Alice,3,
