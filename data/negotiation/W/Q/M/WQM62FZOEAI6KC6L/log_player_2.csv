# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that's extremely valuable to me. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product, I can assure you it's worth at least $12000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000.  This is a great deal, as you'll be getting a product with a high intrinsic value.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's value:** While Alice claims the product is worth at least $12,000,  we don't know if this is her true value. It could be a tactic to get you to pay more.
* **Your value:**  You've established a maximum price of $15,000.
* **John's offer:** You have a guaranteed alternative with John at $15,000. 

**Conclusion:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with John or waiting for another offer."
