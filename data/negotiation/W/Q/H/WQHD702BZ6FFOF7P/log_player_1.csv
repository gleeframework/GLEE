Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. Any deal depends on you offering a price below Bob's value and hoping he accepts.

**The Offer**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the stated values, you need to entice Bob while still aiming for a higher profit. Here's a strategy:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. I believe its true value is significantly higher in the right hands. To make this a win-win, I'm offering it to you for $1,199,000. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1199000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Creates a sense of urgency and value.
* **""True Value"" Language:** Implies the price might be a bargain.
* **""Win-Win"":**  Frames the deal positively.
* **Price Below Bob's Value:**  Offers a compelling reason to buy.
* **Limited-Time:**  Encourages a quick decision.

**Important Notes**

* This strategy is a gamble. Bob might still reject the offer. 
* There's always a chance Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate or walk away knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John.
* This scenario highlights the importance of understanding both your own and your counterpart's positions in a negotiation."
