Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Backup plan:** I'm prepared to sell to John for $12,000 if Bob rejects my offer, so I'm not taking a huge risk.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth negotiating further or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and even lower than my initial offer. Accepting this would result in a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's still interested. I can use this as a starting point for further negotiations. 

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a good price, and it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $9,000 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $7,500.
* **Maintaining profit:** This price still allows me to make a profit, as it is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess the situation carefully.  If he counters with a price too low, I might consider selling to John for $12,000 to ensure I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer:**  Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it's still a significant loss for me.
* **Time is money:**  This negotiation is dragging on, and I'm not confident Bob will come up to my desired price. 
* **Secure profit:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiations.

**Next steps:**

I'll sell the product to John and move on to other opportunities."
