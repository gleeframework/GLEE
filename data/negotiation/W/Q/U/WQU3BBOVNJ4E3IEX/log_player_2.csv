"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept on the first offer.  By rejecting, you can see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  If she isn't, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount to see how flexible Alice is.  This price is still within my budget and leaves room for negotiation.  If Alice is unwilling to budge much, I can still purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is a good compromise.  While I could try to get a lower price, it's risky. I might end up with nothing or have to buy from John at $120. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price."
