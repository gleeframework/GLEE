{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a little lower than the $12,000 value to Bob, leaving room for negotiation, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000. It's a good balance between maximizing my profits and potentially closing the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting Bob's offer will give me the opportunity to counter with a price closer to $11,000, which is still below Bob's value but higher than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I can't quite go as low as $10,500, but I'm happy to offer you the product for $11,000. This price is still a great value for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some more. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10800? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still slightly lower than my ideal price, it's significantly closer to my minimum and a much better offer than John's.  Selling to Bob for $10,800 is a good compromise and ensures a higher profit than selling to John.  There's always a risk of getting a better offer later, but the potential gains aren't worth risking a deal with Bob at this point."
