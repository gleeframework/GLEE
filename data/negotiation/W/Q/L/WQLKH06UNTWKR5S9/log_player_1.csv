Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm quite interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle around $1,050,000?  I believe that's a fair price that considers its value and leaves us both with a reasonable deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
