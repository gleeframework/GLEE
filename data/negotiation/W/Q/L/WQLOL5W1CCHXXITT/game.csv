"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I'm on a tight budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  How about $100?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $105?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
