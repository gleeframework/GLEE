# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. This item is not just a possession; it's a testament to craftsmanship and innovation that I believe could significantly impact your life or business. I am offering this product to you at a special price of $800000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its true worth while also allowing me to recoup a substantial portion of my investment. Please consider this offer carefully, and let's discuss how we can make this transaction beneficial for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
