"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $700,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $700,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $800,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $650,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $675,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, the price difference is now relatively small. Accepting this offer saves you $125,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially beneficial choice at this point."
