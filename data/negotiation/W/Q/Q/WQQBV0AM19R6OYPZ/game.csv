"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $700,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $650,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both parties.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $675,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",675000.0,Alice,3,
