``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice:**  You get the product for $13,000, which is within your budget and saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer:**  This would force you to buy from John for $15,000, which is more expensive. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
