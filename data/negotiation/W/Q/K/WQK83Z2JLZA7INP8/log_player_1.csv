``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it gives room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can still potentially get closer to my desired price with counteroffers. However, I'm keeping John as a backup option to ensure I don't lose out on a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $1,000,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can come to an agreement."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value this product brings. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $1,000,000. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but if he doesn't budge, I'm going to sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're serious about getting this product, this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I've made multiple concessions and it's clear we won't be able to agree on a price that works for both of us.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option to maximize my profit."
