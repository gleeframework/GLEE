,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value this product brings. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're serious about getting this product, this is my final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
