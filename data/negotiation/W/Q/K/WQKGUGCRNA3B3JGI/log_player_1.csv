Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a significant amount of money for me, but it leaves room for potential negotiation and still allows me to earn significantly more than selling to John.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to pay a price closer to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob $925,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price,  $910,000 is a good amount of money and it's becoming clear that Bob isn't likely to go much higher.  I'm happy to secure this sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or potentially having to sell to John for less."
