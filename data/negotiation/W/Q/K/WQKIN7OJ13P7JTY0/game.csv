"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $500,000 is significantly below the product's value, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  This would still be a good deal for both of us. ",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $750,000 is too high for me. Considering the current market situation and my budget constraints, could we aim for $600,000? I hope this proposal will be more agreeable.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $600,000 is still a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to make one last concession. Let's try $650,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say? ",650000.0,Alice,5,
