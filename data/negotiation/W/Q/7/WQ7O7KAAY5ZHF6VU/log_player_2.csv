"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $85 is tempting, I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a good price for both of us, and it'll ensure a smooth transaction.
