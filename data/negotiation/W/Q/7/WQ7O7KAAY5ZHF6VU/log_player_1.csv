{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate but still leaves room for you to profit.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:**  You're still making a profit, even if Bob accepts this offer.

By starting with this offer, you create an opportunity for a successful negotiation while ensuring you don't undervalue your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $85 is tempting, I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a good price for both of us, and it'll ensure a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $92.50. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That way, I can get a good deal, and you can still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $90, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original offer of $100.  How about $95? That's a good middle ground that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get close to your original offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $88 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and it seems like our negotiation has reached a stalemate. Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $120."
