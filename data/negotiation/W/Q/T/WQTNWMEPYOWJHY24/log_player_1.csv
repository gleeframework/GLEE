"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm aiming for a price above my minimum but still attractive to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary. 
* **Leaving Room:** There's a $3,000 difference between my asking price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves space for potential counteroffers and negotiations. 
* **Setting the Tone:**  The message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, I still believe there's room for negotiation. He's shown interest, so I can counteroffer and try to find a compromise.
* **No Rush:** With 10 rounds, I have time to try and get a better price without risking a deal falling through. Selling to John is an option, but I'm aiming higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to emphasize that my offer is still reasonable. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The message ends with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a fair price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my absolute minimum price.
* **No Room for Improvement:**  While I'd prefer more, there's a good chance I won't be able to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob entirely and ending up with the same price from John.  
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting the offer now saves time and ensures a sale."
