,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to pay $115.  What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $115 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? That feels fair to both of us, and it's a great deal for such a valuable product.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $122.50 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $120.  That feels like a good compromise for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
