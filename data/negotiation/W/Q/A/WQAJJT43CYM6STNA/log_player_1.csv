Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, attempting to sell to Bob first at a higher price could yield a better profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob recognizes the product's value to him ($800,000) and the potential savings compared to my alternative buyer.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:**  Highlighting that this is an exclusive offer before I go to other buyers adds a subtle pressure for Bob to decide quickly. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes there's no significant cost (like time delay) in selling to John if Bob declines. 
*  I'm leaving room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving me a chance to adjust my price slightly and still stay above my minimum."
