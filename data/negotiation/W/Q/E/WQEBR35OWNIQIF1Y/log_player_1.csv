Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know this product is worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I believe I can negotiate a better price with him. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above my minimum. I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000 for your product. This aligns more closely with my budget while still reflecting its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum threshold.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and avoids the potential of losing out entirely."
