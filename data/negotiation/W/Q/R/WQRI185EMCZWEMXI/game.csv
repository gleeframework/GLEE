"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product,  $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1250000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering your valuation and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $1250000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1325000. This is a fair price considering your budget and the potential benefits this product offers. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1325000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there.  I'd be willing to pay $1300000.  This price would be a great deal for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
