Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a price that is:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He values it at $8,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **Lower than my minimum acceptable value:** I won't settle for anything less than $12,000, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation.

This strategy allows me to potentially gain a higher price than what John would offer, while still having a backup buyer in case Bob rejects the offer."
