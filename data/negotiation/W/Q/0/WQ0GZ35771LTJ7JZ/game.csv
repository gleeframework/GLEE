"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate the compromise. However, based on my assessment of the product's value and my budget, I am unable to agree to the price of $1450000. I would like to make one final counteroffer at $1425000. This is my maximum willingness to pay, and I hope we can reach an agreement that is acceptable to both of us.",1425000.0,Bob,4,
