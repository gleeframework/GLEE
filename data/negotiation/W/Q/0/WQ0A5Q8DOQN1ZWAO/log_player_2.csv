(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $180. This is far above your desired price.  It's worth trying to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you're excited about this product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it, but I can't go any higher."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $160.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $160 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $160 is still a bit higher than I can afford. I'm happy to meet you at $130, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I think I can do a bit better than $130. How about $145? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $145 is getting closer to your limit, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You can try to bridge the gap and see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price. I'm happy to meet you at $140, but I can't go any higher.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $142, but I need to make sure I get a good price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $142 is only slightly over your limit, you've already rejected Alice's offer several times and it seems like she's not budging much.  It's getting close to your limit, and you risk getting into a long negotiation with no guarantee of a better deal.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $100."
