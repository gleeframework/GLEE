Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum, I leave room for negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response will indicate how much he values the product. If he readily accepts, I know I could have potentially gone higher. 
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm not losing out. I have a guaranteed sale to John at $10,000."
