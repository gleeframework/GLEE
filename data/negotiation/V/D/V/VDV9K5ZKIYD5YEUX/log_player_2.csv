Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise.

This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this asset.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to go down to $900,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this asset. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on price, she's still significantly above your maximum budget and has stated $900,000 is her lowest price.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000."
