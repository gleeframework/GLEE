"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I could go up to $700,000.  If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to go down to $900,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this asset. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
