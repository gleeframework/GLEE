I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good deal for both of us: 

* I get a good price, almost as high as John's offer.
* Bob gets the product for a price that's significantly lower than what it's worth to him.

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving room for Bob to make a profitable purchase."
