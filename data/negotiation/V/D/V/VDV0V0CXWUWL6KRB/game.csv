"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust your offer. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower your price to $8,000? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial arrangement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8,500.  I've already lowered the price significantly, and I'm confident this is still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but given my budget, I am unable to go above $8,000. Could you consider meeting me halfway between your last offer and mine? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
