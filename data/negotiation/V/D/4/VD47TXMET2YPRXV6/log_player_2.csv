"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $200 is way too high!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for us to move up while staying well below our $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still too high. We're better off seeing if we can negotiate further or sticking with John's offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm glad to hear you're willing to negotiate. $140 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we try $95? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're inching closer to our limit, but we still have some wiggle room. This offer shows Alice we're willing to compromise but are also holding firm on a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more than that.  Would you be willing to consider $120? That's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $120.  While we could continue negotiating, it's not worth the risk of exceeding our $100 budget. Buying from John guarantees us the product at the best price."
