"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad to hear you're willing to negotiate. $140 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we try $95? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more than that.  Would you be willing to consider $120? That's a fair compromise.",120.0,Alice,5,
