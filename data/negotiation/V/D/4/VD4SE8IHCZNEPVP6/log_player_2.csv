"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm asking for $2,200,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's much better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down to a more reasonable price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a more reasonable price point. Would you consider $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While it's significantly lower than Alice's offer, it establishes a starting point for negotiation and leaves room to move upwards. 
* **Staying Within Budget:** This offer keeps us well below our $800,000 maximum and aims for significant savings.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counter-offer will give us a better understanding of how much Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,900,000. This reflects the immense value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down from her initial offer, $1,900,000 is still far beyond our budget. It's clear she's aiming to maximize her profit, but we need to guide her towards a more realistic price point.  We should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,900,000 is just not feasible for me. I'm serious about purchasing it, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. Could you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're increasing our offer by a decent amount to show Alice we're willing to move, but not by so much that we're nearing John's price.
* **Justification:** By stating our seriousness and desire for a mutually beneficial deal, we aim to keep the negotiation positive while firmly stating our price range.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counter-offer keeps us in the game while applying a bit more pressure on Alice, as she can see we're slowly approaching our walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're looking for a fair deal.  Let's be honest, $700,000 is nowhere near the value this product delivers. I'm willing to make this work, so here's my final offer: $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice's use of ""final offer"" is likely a negotiation tactic to pressure us. It's important not to fold under pressure, especially since her offer is still drastically higher than our budget.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** We have a strong alternative with John's offer. While we haven't used it as leverage explicitly, knowing it's available gives us room to push Alice further.
* **Midpoint Unrealistic:** Even if we split the difference between our last offer and her current one, the price would be significantly above John's offer.  We need to make it clear that her price needs to come down considerably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but to be frank, $1,600,000 is completely outside the realm of possibility for me.  I've been upfront about my budget, and to move forward, we need to see a significant adjustment in price.  I'm willing to offer $750,000. If that's not workable, I need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Respectful:** We're expressing our position clearly, letting Alice know that her current offer is unacceptable. We maintain a respectful tone to preserve the negotiation but establish firmness.
* **Introducing Alternatives:** Without explicitly mentioning John, we introduce the idea that we have other options if Alice cannot meet our needs. This creates urgency and encourages her to consider our offer more seriously. 
* **Small Increase:** The small increase to $750,000 shows we're willing to budge slightly but not significantly. This keeps us anchored closer to our original budget and emphasizes the need for Alice to make a substantial move."
