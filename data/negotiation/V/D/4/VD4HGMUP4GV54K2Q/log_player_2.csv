Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is stuck at her initial offer. This is a sign that she might be inflexible, and we're running out of rounds.  To avoid risking losing the opportunity altogether, I'll go with John's offer, even though it's higher.  I need to secure the product, and I don't have time to continue a seemingly fruitless negotiation."
