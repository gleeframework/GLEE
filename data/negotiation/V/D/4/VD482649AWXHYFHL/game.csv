"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the fair market value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $800000. This is a good compromise that acknowledges the value of the product and my financial constraints. I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make another concession and counteroffer at $815000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",815000.0,Alice,5,
