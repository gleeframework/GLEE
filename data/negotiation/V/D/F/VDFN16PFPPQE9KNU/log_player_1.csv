"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

$13,000 is close enough to my desired price, and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer in the next round.  I'll take it!"
