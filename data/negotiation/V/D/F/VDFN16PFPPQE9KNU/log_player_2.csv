"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  He's offering a price that is halfway between Alice's minimum value and his own maximum. This strategy aims to start the negotiation with a strong counteroffer, leaving room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a compromise, it's still closer to her desired price than Bob's. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer. He wants to try and get the price as close to his $12,500 counteroffer as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's raised his offer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise but still keeping the price closer to his initial counteroffer. This approach is designed to push Alice towards a quick agreement."
