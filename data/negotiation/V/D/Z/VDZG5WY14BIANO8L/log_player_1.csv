"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $150 as possible while still making a decent profit.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $150 is my minimum, I'm not going to accept it right away. Bob is clearly trying to get the lowest price possible.  I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher.  I have a lot of negotiation rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counter-offering at $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's lowball offer.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to make a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $160.  This is a good price, and while I'd prefer more, I'm getting closer to my goal with each round.  Accepting this offer means I'll make a profit and avoid potentially getting a lower price if I keep rejecting and counter-offering.  It's better to take the sure profit now."
