"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a rare and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000.  Let me know if you're open to that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you a price of $12000, which is $500 below my previous offer. I'm not sure if I can go any lower than this. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit too high. I'm firm on my offer of $11000. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to explore other options. ",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $11000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $11250. This is my absolute lowest price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $11250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'll go up to $11100. If that's not acceptable, I'll unfortunately have to move on.",11100.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $11075, which is just $25 above your last offer. I think this is a reasonable compromise, but I'm not willing to go any higher. What do you think?",11075.0,Alice,9,
