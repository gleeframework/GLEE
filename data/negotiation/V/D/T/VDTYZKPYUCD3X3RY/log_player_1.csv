{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. It's also reasonable given that the product is worth $10,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far below my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for such a low price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price would still allow you to make a good profit on the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,250. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value. While I would prefer to sell to John for a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale and secures a profit, even if it's not my ideal outcome."
