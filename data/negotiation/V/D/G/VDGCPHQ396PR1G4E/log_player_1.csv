"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm eager to make a deal, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,100,000 simply isn't enough for me to let go of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price given its value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000, which is closer to my maximum.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I appreciate his willingness to move up, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is truly my minimum. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I'm offering it to you at that price. It's a fair deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your investment. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
