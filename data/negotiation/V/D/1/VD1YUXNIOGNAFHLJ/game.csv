"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.",8500.0,Alice,5,
