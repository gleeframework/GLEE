I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500.  At this point, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000. You'll save $500 and avoid further negotiation."
