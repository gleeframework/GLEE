"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, and I'm open to discussing the details further. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $2,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,750,000?  I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I can see you're serious about this purchase.  To show you I'm flexible, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the movement on price.  To be honest, I have another offer at $1,200,000. To avoid going with the other offer, I would need you to come down to $1,450,000.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
