"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you.  I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for something that can be so transformative.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, the price is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it, considering its value to me and my current financial constraints. I'm open to further discussion, but this is my initial counteroffer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counterproposal.  While I understand your position, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price considering our respective positions. This would be my final offer, as I'm not comfortable exceeding my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
