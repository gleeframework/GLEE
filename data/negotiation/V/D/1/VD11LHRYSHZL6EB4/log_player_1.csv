"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth much more to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know it's worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiations to leave room for compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm being clear that I'm open to negotiating, but I'm also establishing a strong starting point.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll wait for Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to assess whether to make a counteroffer or move on to John.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, but I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, as I believe I can get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at.
* **Negotiation Room:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to compromise, but not at such a drastic loss to my desired price.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can keep the negotiation going and potentially reach a more favorable price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range.
* **John's Offer:** I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option, but I'm still hoping to close the deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly closer to my desired value.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair deal for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and compromise.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm reiterating my willingness to negotiate, signaling to Bob that I'm open to finding a solution that works for both parties.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll await Bob's response to my counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option.  I'm still hopeful that I can reach a mutually acceptable agreement with Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a significant gap between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price.  I believe I can push for a better deal.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, but I'm still hoping to get more from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.
* **John's Offer:** I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a backup, but I'm not ready to give up on a better deal with Bob yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $950,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.

Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing continued flexibility by lowering my price from the previous round, but still maintaining a significant margin above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the true value of the product, hoping to sway Bob into seeing the potential for a good return on his investment. 
* **Call to Action:**  I'm urging Bob to close the deal, framing it as a win-win situation for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to reassess my options.
* **John's Offer:**  I'll continue to monitor John's offer as a potential fallback option, but I'm hoping to reach a successful agreement with Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer, while slightly higher, is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** The gap between our positions is shrinking, but I believe I can still push for a better deal. 
* **John's Offer is a Secure Option:**  I'm hesitant to accept Bob's offer because I know I can get $1,000,000 from John.  This gives me a safety net and allows me to continue negotiating with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make another counteroffer to Bob, hoping to bridge the remaining gap.
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind, knowing I can always fall back on it."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $987,500.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing continued flexibility by lowering my price again, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value and ensures I make at least my minimum.
* **Small Gap:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a small step away from Bob's offer, hoping to make it more appealing and easier for him to accept.
* **Final Push:**  I'm pushing for a deal in this round, as I'm getting close to my minimum and have the secure option of John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'm very interested in Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll have to carefully consider whether to accept John's offer.
* **John's Offer:**  I'll be prepared to accept John's offer if Bob continues to refuse."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $987,500. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I think I can do better than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $962,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's final offer is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

* **Sell to John:** I will accept John's offer to ensure I get at least my minimum price and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
