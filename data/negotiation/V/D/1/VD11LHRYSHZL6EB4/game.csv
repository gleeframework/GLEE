"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth much more to me. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge this gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $950,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and offer it for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $987,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it's just a small step away from your offer. What do you say?",987500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $987,500. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I think I can do better than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $962,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",962500.0,Bob,8,
