Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $115, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  I mention the product's good condition and personal value to emphasize its worth.
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price. 

This strategy aims to get Bob to consider the offer and potentially counter with a higher price, bringing us closer to my desired price point. If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While I could accept Bob's offer, I believe there's a chance for a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and try to bridge the gap. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the option to sell to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer ($115) and Bob's offer ($105). This demonstrates willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I frame the offer as being ""fair"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Maintain a reasonable price:**  $110 is still above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to negotiate further if needed.

This approach aims to keep negotiations moving while still holding out for a price closer to my desired amount.  I can adjust my counteroffer in subsequent rounds based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about $107.50?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $107.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation progress:** While Bob has moved closer to my price, there is still room for a better deal.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $120, so there is no risk in continuing negotiations.

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, attempting to reach a price that is closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that.  However,  $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $112.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be willing to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to bridge the gap:** I'm counteroffering with $112.50, which is halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's latest offer ($107.50). This shows a continued willingness to compromise. 
* **Adding urgency:** I mention finalizing the sale to subtly increase the pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $112.50 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, allowing for potential future concessions while still being profitable. 

By continuing to negotiate and offering a fair compromise, I'm aiming to reach a mutually agreeable price without having to resort to selling to John for a lower profit."
