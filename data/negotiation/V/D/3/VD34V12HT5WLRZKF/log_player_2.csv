"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's better than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($800,000) and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting, Bob can counteroffer at a lower price, potentially saving more money. 
* **No immediate urgency:** There's no indication that the product is scarce or time-sensitive, so Bob can take the time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:**  This counteroffer significantly reduces the price, signaling to Alice that Bob is serious about a deal but also demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $850,000 is a reasonable price given the product's worth to Alice and Bob's maximum budget. This leaves room for further negotiation while still being attractive to Alice.
* **Friendly tone:** The message maintains a friendly and cooperative tone, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While it's a decrease from the original $950,000, it's still above Bob's desired price point and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob can continue negotiating by making another counteroffer.  By consistently lowering the price, Bob might be able to get a deal closer to his ideal price.
* **No urgency:**  There's no indication of time pressure, so Bob can continue to negotiate.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 would be a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $875,000? That's a good middle ground, and we can both walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between Alice's last offer ($900,000) and Bob's previous offer ($850,000).
* **Maintaining momentum:** This shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also avoids a drastic price jump, making it more likely Alice will accept.
* **Positive language:** The message uses positive language (""good middle ground,"" ""walk away happy"") to keep the negotiation amicable."
