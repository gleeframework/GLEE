Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While we start high, the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price slightly too high. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, ensuring we don't lose out completely if Bob rejects the offer.

By starting at $14,000, we give ourselves the best chance to secure a price that's significantly higher than our minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
