{""message"": ""Bob, I've given your offer a lot of thought, and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'm prepared to move forward with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than to risk a lower price from Bob."
