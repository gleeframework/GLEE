Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I recommend:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (anything less and you're better off with John).
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 (he won't pay more than this).
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You need to find a price that Bob finds attractive while staying above your minimum. Since you have a backup offer, you can afford to start higher. Aiming slightly below Bob's maximum value gives you room to negotiate and still ensures you get a good deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,175,000. I believe this represents a fair deal, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The language is positive and positions the product as valuable. It also signals a willingness to negotiate without appearing desperate.
* **Price:**  $1,175,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for Bob to counter-offer while still exceeding your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly higher.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you're under time pressure, a slightly lower initial offer might speed up the process.

**Remember:** This is just the opening move. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response."
