Alice is being stubborn and sticking to her initial offer.  There's still room for negotiation, and I can try to get a lower price.  It's not worth going to John yet."

Alice's offer is now higher than my maximum. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  While I wanted to get a lower price, it's better to get the product than to risk losing it and having to find another seller."
