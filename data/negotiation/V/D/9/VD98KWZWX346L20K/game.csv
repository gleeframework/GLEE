"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price, considering its value to both of us.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away with a profitable agreement.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still too low for me. Let's try $1,000,000. This price is closer to what I need to consider, and it's a fair deal given the product's value.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really need to make this deal work, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
