"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer you $9,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, however. How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $10,250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you think?",10250.0,Bob,4,
