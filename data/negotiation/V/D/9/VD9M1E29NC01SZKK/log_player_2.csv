{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way over his budget. It's worth exploring a counteroffer or going to John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if he can get closer to his $10,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? I think that would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $14,500 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice is not budging much, and Bob is getting close to his limit. At this point, buying from John for $10,000 is the best option to stay within his budget."
