I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but still within a reasonable range, and closer to Bob's offer. I believe this shows a willingness to compromise while still holding on to a substantial profit."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm getting close to the end of my rounds.  While I'd like to get a better deal, I'm not confident that Bob will come up to my price. Selling to John ensures a secure deal that meets my minimum requirements."
