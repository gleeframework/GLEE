"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my initial offer.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
