Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while staying above her minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, should he be interested. 
* **Secure a Deal Quickly:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum encourages a quick decision. This is important because Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000.

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential to gain more than John's offer."
