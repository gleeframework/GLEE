Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $950,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to make a substantial profit.
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the value the product has for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to counteroffer if he doesn't accept the initial price. This keeps the negotiation process going and allows me to gauge his interest.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Difference:**  While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still $100,000 less than my starting offer and leaves less room for profit. I'm confident I can do better. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob is clearly interested in the product, and he's willing to pay a significant amount.  I believe there's still potential to get closer to my ideal price.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is still a very fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm coming down from my initial offer of $950,000 to $900,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. This is a significant reduction, showing good faith.
* **Value Focus:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit he'll get from owning it.
* **Open to Finality:**  The message implies that this is a reasonable final offer, encouraging Bob to accept to avoid risking losing the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a profitable sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess the situation carefully.  I can either counter again with a price closer to his offer or consider selling to John if it seems unlikely I can reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $900,000. How about $850,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Upside:** Bob's final offer of $850,000 is only $50,000 below my previous counteroffer.  There's limited room for further negotiation, and I risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and potentially lead to a loss of opportunity cost. 
* **Acceptable Profit:** While I would have preferred a higher price, $850,000 is still a significant profit and represents a reasonable return on my investment.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale, securing a good price for my product."
