"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can get a better deal by counter-offering, as the product is worth $80 to Alice and you're willing to pay up to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's still a great price for a product worth $150 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At $110, the deal is still good for you, and you're saving $40 compared to buying from John. It's a good compromise."
