Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your description of the product.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to go right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
