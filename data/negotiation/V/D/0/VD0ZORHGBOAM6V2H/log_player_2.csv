"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  Since Alice is willing to sell for $120, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $135? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $125. While Alice has moved closer, $135 is still a bit too high. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get a quick sale."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $135. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. How about we meet at $132.50? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While $132.50 is slightly higher than Bob's last offer, it's a good deal compared to John's price of $150.  It's unlikely Bob will get a better price from Alice, so accepting the offer is the best option."
