"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to get the product for under $15,000, and $12,000 is already close to your limit.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is still an option.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you can always buy from John, but you want to try and save money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** You're still aiming for a price below $10,000. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your target, there's still a gap that can be bridged.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** While it's tempting to take this offer, you can potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you $10,250 for the product. This seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer you a slightly better compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target.**  You're aiming for a price below $10,000, and $10,750 is still a bit too high.
* **There's still a chance to negotiate further.** Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise, so there's potential to get closer to your target price.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** You still have five rounds left, giving you time to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. How about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway again. I'll sell the product to you for $10,750, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.**  You're aiming for a price below $10,000, and $10,750 is only slightly above that.
* **Alice has made it clear this is her final offer.**  There's a risk of continuing negotiations and ending up with no deal, leaving you to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **You have limited rounds left.** With only three rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly likely that you'll need to buy from John if you don't accept Alice's offer. 

While $10,750 isn't your ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and a better deal than buying from John.  It's time to accept and move on."
