Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000}

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to try and get a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
