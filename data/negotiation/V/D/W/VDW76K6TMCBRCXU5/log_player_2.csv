"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find something that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects the significant value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly better than John's offer of $1,200,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject a lower counteroffer and he'll end up having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal and avoids further negotiation."
