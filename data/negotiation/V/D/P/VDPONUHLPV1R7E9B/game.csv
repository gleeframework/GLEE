"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe this price reflects both our interests. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,100,000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about the budget. How about we meet at $1,200,000? It's a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while making the product more accessible for you. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I could do $1,180,000 to finalize the deal.  That's a very strong offer and shows how serious I am about purchasing this product. Let me know what you think.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position and appreciate your persistence.  $1,180,000 is very close, but I'm still hoping for a little more. How about $1,190,000?  It's a small step closer to your offer, and it gives me the chance to secure a more favorable deal. Let's find a common ground and get this done.",1190000.0,Alice,7,
