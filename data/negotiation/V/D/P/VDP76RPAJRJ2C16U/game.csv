"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Is that something we can work with?",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $1,225,000 reflects that more accurately. It splits the difference between our offers and represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,225,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about we settle at $1,200,000?  This represents a significant investment for you, but I believe the product's value will more than make up for it in the long run.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my target, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,175,000 and throw in some additional support or services to sweeten the deal?",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for added value.  To show my commitment, I'm willing to include a small support package valued at $10,000. However, the price for the product remains firm at $1,200,000.  I believe this offer balances both our needs effectively.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the additional support package, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,200,000 and include a more comprehensive support package, including regular maintenance and updates for a year?",1200000.0,Bob,8,
