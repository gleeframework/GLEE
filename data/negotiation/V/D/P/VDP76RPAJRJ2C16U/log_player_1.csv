{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is trying to negotiate a better price.  He's budged upward, but is now asking for additional perks. While $1,175,000 is a good offer, we're still in early rounds of negotiation. We need to gauge if he's willing to go higher before considering adding extras that cut into our profit margin."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for added value.  To show my commitment, I'm willing to include a small support package valued at $10,000. However, the price for the product remains firm at $1,200,000.  I believe this offer balances both our needs effectively."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Hold firm on price:** We've lowered the price slightly over several rounds, but now we need to signal that we're firm. Holding at $1,200,000 keeps us above our minimum and shows Bob we're serious.
* **Add a small incentive:**  The support package is a strategic concession. It adds perceived value for Bob without significantly impacting our profit.
* **Clear and confident message:** By clearly stating the price remains firm, we set a strong negotiating stance while still being open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the additional support package, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,200,000 and include a more comprehensive support package, including regular maintenance and updates for a year? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We've reached our target price:** Bob has agreed to our desired price of $1,200,000.
* **The additional support is manageable:** While a more comprehensive support package adds some cost on our end, it's likely a worthwhile investment to close the deal at this price. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  We only have two rounds left, and there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting now secures a significant profit."
