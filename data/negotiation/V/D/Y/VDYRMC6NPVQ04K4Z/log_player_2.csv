Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not quite comfortable with $95, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $102, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $102 gets you a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing and having to buy from John for $150."
