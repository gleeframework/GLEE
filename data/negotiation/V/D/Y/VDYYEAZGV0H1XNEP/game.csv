"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a little high. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1,000,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,150,000. This is my best offer at this time, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,075,000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
