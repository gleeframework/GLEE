"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a good profit for me, considering my minimum price is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum profit margin. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $90. This is still a decent profit for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $82 is close to John's offer, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
``` 

I'm dropping my price to $88. This is getting close to my minimum but I believe it's still a good deal for Bob, and I'm hoping he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $84 is a decent profit, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price from him. I have four rounds left, and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 86}
```

I'm offering a price of $86. This is my final offer before considering John's offer. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $83
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time.  I've been unable to get Bob to budge on his offer, and $83 is a decent profit. However, I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. It's better than losing more time trying to negotiate with Bob."
