Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer gives you a significant profit while still leaving room for Bob to make a profit. This is a good strategy because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** Bob still has $200,000 in potential profit if he accepts. This incentivizes him to buy.
* **It avoids a negotiation:** By offering a firm price, you avoid haggling and potential delays.

By offering this price, you increase your chances of maximizing your profit while also increasing the likelihood that Bob will accept."
