"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I value your offer,  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, the gap between our positions is still fairly wide. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price. I'd much rather make this deal with you, but I need to see a number closer to my original ask. Could you do $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand the position you're in. While that other offer is tempting for you, I'm a serious buyer, and I'm ready to close the deal.  Would you consider $1,200,000? That's my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
