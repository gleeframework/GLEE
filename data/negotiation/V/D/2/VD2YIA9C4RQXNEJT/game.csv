"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $11,500?  This still gives you a significant savings, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",11500.0,Alice,3,
