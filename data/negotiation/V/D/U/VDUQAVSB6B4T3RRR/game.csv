"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? This price still gives you a good value and allows me to move forward with the sale.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This price offers a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
