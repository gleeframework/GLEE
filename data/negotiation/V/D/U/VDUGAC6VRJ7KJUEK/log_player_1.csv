Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and framing the offer as a good deal to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, which is important to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob is unreasonable or if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There is room for negotiation.  Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, suggesting he might be willing to pay more. 
* **John is a Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $12,000, which gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. The product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to come up in price.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm not settling for Bob's initial offer, reminding him that I have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $9,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price point of $9,250. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer and counter again, there's a chance he'll walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $12,000.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Accepting the offer allows me to close the deal sooner, which is generally beneficial.

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $9,250, the potential risks of further negotiation outweigh the potential reward. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a price that's still within my acceptable range."
