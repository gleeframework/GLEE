Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always fall back to selling to John for $150 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm going to counter with $165. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum, but I'm showing flexibility and willingness to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $160.  It's still a good price for me, and further negotiation might not get me much higher.  It's also a good deal for Bob, and I don't want to risk him walking away."
