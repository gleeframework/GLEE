(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than Bob's maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal quickly.  This price is still above Bob's maximum, but it demonstrates his seriousness in negotiating.  There's a chance Alice might accept, and if not, it sets the stage for further negotiation."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still higher than his maximum.  There's still room for negotiation and potentially getting an even better price.  Rejecting allows for further rounds to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing flexibility but still aiming for a price below his maximum. This keeps the negotiation moving and puts pressure on Alice to come down further."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is very close to Bob's maximum price, but there's still a small gap. Bob has already rejected offers closer to his max, so it's worth seeing if he can get a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:** This is Bob's final offer. He is willing to pay his maximum price and wants to see if Alice will accept it.  If she does, great!  If not, he can always buy from John at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is just $20,000 less than Bob's maximum.  It's tempting, but with only three rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation is not worth it.  Bob can secure the product for his maximum price from John, guaranteeing the deal and preventing the possibility of a worse outcome."
