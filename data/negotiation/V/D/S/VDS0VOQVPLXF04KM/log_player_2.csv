"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $97.50.  My final offer is $105.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Alice will go below $100.  Buying from John guarantees you stay within budget."
