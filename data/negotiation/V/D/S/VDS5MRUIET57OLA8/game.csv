"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to ensure I receive a fair return. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 still falls short of my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $940,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's close this and move forward.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $930,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle and make a deal.",930000.0,Bob,6,
