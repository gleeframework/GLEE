You can get a better deal than $9,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before buying from John."

You're still closer to your goal of $8,000. Keep negotiating with Alice, as you still have room to bargain."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer you $9,000, which is the same as my initial offer, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.

Alice is unwilling to budge on her price, and it seems the negotiation is stuck.  At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for $10,000. You're still getting a product you value at $10,000 for a price that's within your budget."
