"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to me while still leaving you a sizable profit margin. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000, so I'm offering $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
