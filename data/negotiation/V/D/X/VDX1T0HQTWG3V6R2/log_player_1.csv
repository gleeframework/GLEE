Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This way, I can maximize my potential profit while still remaining competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. Although $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can signal that I'm not desperate to sell and that I value the product highly. This will hopefully encourage him to come up with a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $10,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise - how about $10,500?  This gives us both a good deal and allows me to  continue offering this product to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $10200 for the product. This still allows us to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. While $10,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. By rejecting his offer, I'm showing him that I'm willing to negotiate further and that I believe the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $10,300.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10300}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $10250 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $10,250.  We've reached a point where the negotiation is getting very close to my minimum.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's important to be realistic and recognize when a deal is good enough."
