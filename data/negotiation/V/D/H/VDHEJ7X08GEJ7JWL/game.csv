"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. $200 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I can meet you in the middle at $175. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to pay $150, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,
