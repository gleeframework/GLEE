"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is too far below my desired price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm offering $900,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not able to go that low. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $887,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied.",887500.0,Alice,5,
