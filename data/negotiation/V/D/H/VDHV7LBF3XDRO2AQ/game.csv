"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
