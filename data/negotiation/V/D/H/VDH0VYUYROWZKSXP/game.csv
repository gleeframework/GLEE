"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. Can we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $12,500. This is a significant discount considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new counteroffer of $11,000, but I'm willing to go up to $11,500. Can we meet at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
