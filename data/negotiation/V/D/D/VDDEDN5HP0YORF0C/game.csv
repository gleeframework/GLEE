"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer.  Could you consider $17,000?  I'm willing to negotiate to find a price that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle somewhere around $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, it seems we're getting closer.  To meet you halfway, how about $14,000?  This reflects the true value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, but $14,000 is still a stretch for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,6,
