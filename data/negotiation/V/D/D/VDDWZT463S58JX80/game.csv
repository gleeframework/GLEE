"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you at $15000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price or is that too low for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $8000 is significantly below what I can accept. How about we split the difference and agree on $11500? I'm confident this product will bring you substantial value, and this price reflects that.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $11500 is a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
