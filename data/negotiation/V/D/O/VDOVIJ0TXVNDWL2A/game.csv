"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That's a very competitive price for this product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $115? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your bottom line, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and my original offer of $115. How about $117.50?",117.5,Bob,6,
