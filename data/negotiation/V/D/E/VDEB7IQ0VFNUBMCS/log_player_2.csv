Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I've already told you my minimum price is $12,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging from her price range around $12,000. She even increased her offer to $13,000. It's clear she's unlikely to go down to $10,000. It's better to cut losses and take the guaranteed deal from John at this point."
