"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to come down to $75?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $82.50. It's a fair compromise that I think we can both agree on.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $80?  That's the absolute most I can do, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
