"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know if this is something you're interested in, and we can move forward with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm still looking to pay a little less. I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,800 is still lower than John's price of $15,000.
* Accepting this offer means Bob can save $1,200 compared to buying from John. 
*  While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Alice would accept a lower price. 
* Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
