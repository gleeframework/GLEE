Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to maximize my profit, so I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value of $15,000 as possible.
* **Initial Offer:** Offering $14,000 leaves room for negotiation but also sets a high starting point.
* **John's Offer:** Keeping in mind that I can sell to John for $12,000, I won't go below that price. 
* **Negotiation:**  I'm prepared to negotiate further with Bob, but I'll be mindful of John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe it's a bit higher than its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **John's Offer:**  John is willing to pay $12,000, which is already above Bob's offer. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm not willing to sell at a loss, so rejecting Bob's offer is the best option. I can counteroffer to try and reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $13,000 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being significantly higher than his initial offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  I highlight the value the product offers to Bob, reminding him it's worth more to him than the price I'm proposing.
* **Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation but staying firm on my minimum acceptable price.  This counteroffer shows flexibility while also demonstrating my commitment to achieving a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $11,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price, his offer of $11,500 is still below my floor.
* **John's Offer:**  John is willing to pay $12,000, which is higher than Bob's offer and meets my minimum requirement.
* **Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a slightly higher offer, but it's not guaranteed.  I don't want to risk losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price than what John is offering.  

Therefore, selling to John is the most advantageous decision as it guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation uncertainties."
