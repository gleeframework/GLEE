"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $11,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
