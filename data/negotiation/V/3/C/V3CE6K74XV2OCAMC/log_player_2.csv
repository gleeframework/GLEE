It's not worth buying from Alice at $12,000. We'll try to negotiate a better price."

$11,000 is still too high. I'll try to negotiate further."

We've gone back and forth a few times, and Alice's price is still too high. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with her. It's better to go with John's offer at $10,000."
