,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,200. It's still a good compromise, and I believe it's worth it for the value this product will bring you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
