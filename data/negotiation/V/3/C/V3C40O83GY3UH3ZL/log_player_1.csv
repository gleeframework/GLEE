"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range that might entice him to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's ample room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially reach a price closer to my minimum goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate further with Bob and see if we can reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,400,000 is below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within my acceptable range:**  $1,600,000 is above my minimum and below my initial offer, signaling flexibility.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing a ""win-win"" scenario for both of us, hoping to encourage Bob to see the value in my counteroffer.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  This offer provides some room for further negotiation, should Bob still be unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'll make one last attempt to find a middle ground. I'd like to propose a price of $1,550,000. This is my best offer within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** $1,550,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Closing the deal:**  It's advantageous to close the deal at this point rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether. 
* **Minimizing risk:** While I could try to get a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob rejecting further offers or me having to sell to John at a lower price is not worth the potential gain."
