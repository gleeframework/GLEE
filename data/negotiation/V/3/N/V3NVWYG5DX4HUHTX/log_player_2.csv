"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price than $1,200,000 by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a better deal.  While buying from John is an option, it's not the best choice at this point since there's potential for a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $900,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This counteroffer also acknowledges that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, showing that Bob is willing to pay a fair price while still saving a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,500,000 and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers and Bob could end up paying more than $1,100,000 or even be forced to buy from John at $1,500,000. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation risks."
