# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer ($1,350,000)** is better than buying from John ($1,500,000). 
* Even though you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, accepting her offer saves you $150,000."
