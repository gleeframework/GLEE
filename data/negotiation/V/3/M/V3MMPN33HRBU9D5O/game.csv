"Thank you for your response, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I'm unable to match the proposed price of $10,000. Considering the product's true value and the fact that it's worth $12,000 to you, I'd like to suggest a compromise at $12,500. This price reflects the product's worth while still offering some savings compared to my initial offer. I hope this proposal works for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
