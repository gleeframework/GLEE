Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for Alice. The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to make Bob feel valued as a customer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice should reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below her desired profit margin.  She can likely get closer to her goal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is the lowest I can go.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

Alice is still trying to maximize her profit, but she's also demonstrating flexibility in her negotiation. By coming down to $90, she's showing Bob that she's serious about a deal while still staying above her minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $82. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Alice should sell the product to John. While Bob is willing to go up to $82, it's still below Alice's minimum profit margin of $80.  Selling to John ensures a profit for Alice while also minimizing the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
