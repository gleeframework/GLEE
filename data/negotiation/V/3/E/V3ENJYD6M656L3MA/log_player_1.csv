Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob's value is $120, he might be willing to pay a bit more. It's better to start high and potentially negotiate down.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $140 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, and you can always go down to $130-$135 if needed. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning ""value"" subtly emphasizes that the product is worth more than Bob might think. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The phrase ""limited time"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.

By setting the initial price at $140, Alice maximizes her chances of getting a price closer to her minimum acceptable price of $150, while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
