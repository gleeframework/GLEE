# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your limitations, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $810,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $815,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $800,000. While we could push for another round, the potential savings are getting smaller and there's a risk Alice won't budge further. Accepting at $815,000 secures a reasonable deal."
