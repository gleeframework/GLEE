"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to reduce the price to $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit more than I can justify at this time. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $700,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
