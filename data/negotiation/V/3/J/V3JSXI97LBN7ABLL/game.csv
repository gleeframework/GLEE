"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product looks valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $750,000. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings is truly significant, and $750,000 is considerably below its worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway - would you consider $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said,  $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle at $900,000?  I feel that's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
