Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said,  $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle at $900,000?  I feel that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he may not be willing to reach my minimum.  John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 which is a fair price and avoids further negotiation."
