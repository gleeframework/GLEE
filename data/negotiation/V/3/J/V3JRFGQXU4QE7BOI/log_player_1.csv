# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a better deal. I have a few more rounds to work with, so I want to see if I can push for a higher price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I'd like, it's only $25,000 less than my previous counteroffer, and it's getting close to the price I'm willing to settle for.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing too hard."
