"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,500. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit too far from what I had in mind.  How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000.",8200.0,Alice,5,
