# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,500. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down much further.  It's in your best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000 rather than risk Alice not budging and missing out on a better price."
