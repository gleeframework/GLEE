"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,750. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I value finding common ground, $10,750 is still a bit under what I had in mind. How about $11,125 and we seal the deal?",11125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  we're getting close! I'm still not quite there yet with $11,125.  I'm willing to go up to $10,937.50. This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. ",10937.5,Bob,6,
