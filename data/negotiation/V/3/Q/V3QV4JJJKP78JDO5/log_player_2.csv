"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $13,000 is still too high for Bob.  He can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is closer to his desired price, he can likely negotiate a better deal.  He has multiple rounds left and can continue to push for a lower price.  Buying from John right now would cost him more than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,750. I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I value finding common ground, $10,750 is still a bit under what I had in mind. How about $11,125 and we seal the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  $11,125 is closer to his desired price, but he can likely negotiate a better deal. He has several rounds left and can continue to push for a lower price. Buying from John right now would cost him significantly more than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  we're getting close! I'm still not quite there yet with $11,125.  I'm willing to go up to $10,937.50. This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10937.50}
