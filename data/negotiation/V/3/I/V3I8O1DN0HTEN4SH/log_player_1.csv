Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I believe it presents significant value, even exceeding the worth you initially estimated. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could secure a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,500 is a strong offer that provides a potential $2,500 profit for Bob while still netting Alice a price close to her desired minimum. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning another buyer subtly introduces the fear of missing out, making Bob more likely to consider the offer seriously."
