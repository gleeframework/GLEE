"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time opportunity to get your hands on this incredible product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Motivation:** Alice wants to sell the product for as much as possible above its value to her ($1,000,000).
* **Your Goal:** You want to pay as little as possible, while not exceeding your $1,500,000 limit.
* **John's Price:** John acts as a safety net, ensuring you won't be forced to pay more than $1,500,000.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you might:

1. **Prompt a Counteroffer:** Alice might be willing to lower her price to secure the sale.
2. **Negotiate a Better Deal:**  You can use John's price as leverage to negotiate a price closer to $1,000,000. 

Even if Alice doesn't budge, you can always buy from John."
