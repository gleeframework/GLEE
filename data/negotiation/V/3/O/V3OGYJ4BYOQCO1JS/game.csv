"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This would be a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, I can't accept anything less than $1,000,000 for this product. This is my final offer - I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of what you're getting.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
