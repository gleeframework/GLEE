"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's better than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process and potentially save more money."

{""message"": ""Alice,  thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's desired price range. Bob can likely still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to his target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, I can't accept anything less than $1,000,000 for this product. This is my final offer - I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of what you're getting.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price:**  $1,000,000 is within Bob's budget and significantly less than John's price.
* **Alice's ""final offer"" stance:** This suggests further negotiation might be unproductive, and Alice is firm on this price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting the offer could lead to a breakdown in negotiations, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

While Bob might prefer to push for a lower price, accepting this offer ensures he secures the product at a price lower than John's and within his budget."
