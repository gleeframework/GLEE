"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a price significantly higher than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression you believe strongly in the product's value.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, it hints at ""unique value and potential"", leaving room for Bob to ask for clarification and for us to elaborate on the product's worth (in a way that may not directly translate to his specific use case, but still justifies the high price). 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer is also about gauging Bob's seriousness and understanding his negotiation style.  His response will give us valuable information for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a substantial amount, it's still significantly less than our target price and even further from our initial offer.  Rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Demonstrate firmness:** We show Bob we're serious about the product's value and not easily swayed.
* **Maintain negotiating position:** Accepting immediately might make us seem desperate to close the deal.
* **Guide the negotiation:** Our counteroffer will aim to bring the price closer to our desired range. 

We're still in the early rounds, and John's offer provides a safety net, so there's no need to rush into a deal that undervalues the product."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However,  $1,400,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000, which I believe is a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** We've made a significant concession from our initial price, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying above Bob's offer.  
* **Firm but fair:** The tone remains professional and suggests this price is a reasonable compromise, not a random number.
* **Maintaining a strong position:** We're still significantly above Bob's valuation, leaving room for further negotiation while pushing him towards our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but $1,650,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,550,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price. Bob is clearly engaged and willing to negotiate, which is a good sign. We have room to push a little further:

* **Maintain upward pressure:**  We don't want to accept a price too quickly, especially when we're still above our minimum and Bob seems willing to move. 
* **Gauge Bob's flexibility:**  By rejecting this offer, we'll see if he's willing to go above his perceived ""halfway point.""
* **Leverage John's offer:**  John's standing offer provides a safety net, allowing us to be more assertive in seeking a price closer to our target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a point where we both feel comfortable. How about $1,600,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while recognizing the inherent value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're moving closer to Bob's price, but in smaller increments, demonstrating our value while still encouraging him to move upwards. 
* **Anchoring:**  By repeatedly presenting offers above $1,600,000, we're trying to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level.
* **Time Constraint:** While we have rounds remaining, time pressure can be a factor in negotiations. Offering a price that feels like a ""final offer"" might encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think $1,600,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,580,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept. Bob is clearly signaling he's near his maximum price.  While not ideal, $1,580,000 is still a significant profit:

* **Strong Profit:**  We're securing a substantial return above our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), which is the primary goal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Pushing further risks Bob walking away, forcing us to accept John's lower offer or restart negotiations from scratch. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows us to reinvest the capital sooner, potentially generating even greater returns in the long run. 

Negotiation is about finding a balance. While we could aim for more, the risk of losing this deal outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price at this point."
