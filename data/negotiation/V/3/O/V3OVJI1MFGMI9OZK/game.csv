"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know holds significant value for you. My asking price is $1,750,000.  This reflects the unique benefits and potential it offers. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Considering the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price reflecting the value we both see in this deal. ",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership,  $1,400,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting the unique value this product offers. I believe this price is still fair considering the potential benefits for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, which is a significant move from my previous offer.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. I'm hoping we can find common ground here.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
