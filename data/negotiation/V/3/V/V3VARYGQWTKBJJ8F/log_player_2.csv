"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation. You might be able to get it for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The tone remains friendly and shows I'm genuinely interested, encouraging further discussion.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  My offer is above Alice's value ($120) but comfortably below my maximum budget, aiming for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $140 is my initial asking price, I could meet you halfway at $125. This is a very fair offer considering the value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $125 is a solid price, saving you $25 off your maximum budget and a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice raising her price or you missing out entirely. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation has a cost in terms of time and effort.  This offer provides a good balance of price and efficiency."
