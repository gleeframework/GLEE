"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $5,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $5,000 is also quite low considering the product's value to me is $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $10,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,000? It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my costs.",9000.0,Alice,5,
