# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000. This is a fantastic deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your business. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than what John is offering, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can secure the product for his desired price from John."
