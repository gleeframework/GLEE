# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $150 to you, and I believe it's an excellent value. I'm willing to let you have it for $130. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to you ($150 vs. $100).  You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I am willing to consider $120 as the final price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still allowing me to fairly compensate for the value I'm providing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $120, which is still higher than the product's worth to you ($100), but it's lower than John's price ($150) and closer to your initial counteroffer. Accepting this offer is the best option as you can still save money compared to buying from John."
