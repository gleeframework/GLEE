{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's above your minimum ($100) but leaves room for negotiation. It also gives you the opportunity to gauge Bob's interest and potentially adjust your price based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than $100, it's still below my ideal selling price.  I'll try to get closer to $130 with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $115 is slightly lower than I hoped, it's still better than selling to John for $100.  It's important to consider the potential for future deals with Bob, and closing this sale might make him a more willing buyer in the future."
