"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. Can we meet in the middle?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential.  To be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This allows for some movement on my end while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product has value, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $800,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure.  To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down significantly.  I propose a price of $1,450,000. This reflects my strong desire to work with you while ensuring a fair deal on a product of this caliber.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $900,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I've carefully considered our conversations, and in the spirit of partnership, I'm making my final offer: $1,400,000. This price reflects a significant investment from my side and recognizes the value you see in the product. I believe it's a fair and final offer, allowing us both to benefit from this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and make a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
