"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm starting the negotiations at $2,250,000."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""potential"" of the product, aiming to frame its value beyond Bob's current understanding. 
* **Alternative Option:**  The knowledge that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000 gives me leverage and confidence to start high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter-offer in the next round and see if Bob is willing to move closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to move a bit on price, but $1,800,000 is still significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Anchor:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and make a concession to show flexibility. However, I'm anchoring the price at $2,000,000, which is still a substantial profit margin. 
* **Justification:** I continue to emphasize the product's inherent value, subtly implying that Bob's valuation might be undervaluing it.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer encourages Bob to engage in a more give-and-take negotiation while still leaving me room to potentially go lower if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to my range, but we're still $250,000 apart. I'm willing to hold firm for now and see if I can nudge him closer to $1,900,000 in the next round. The risk of losing the deal to John is calculated, but I believe there's still a chance to secure a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from on price. Let's make this work. If you're willing to meet me at $1,900,000, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm presenting this as my final offer to create a sense of urgency. 
* **Compromise:**  This price point represents a significant compromise on my part but still secures a healthy profit above my minimum.
* **Clear Expectation:**  By stating ""If you're willing to meet me..."", I'm setting a clear expectation for Bob to close the deal at this price.
* **Time Constraint:** With fewer rounds remaining, I need to push for a decision and avoid getting stuck in endless back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:**  With only 5 rounds left, the time pressure is on.  Dragging the negotiation further increases the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Minimal Difference:**  The difference between his offer ($1,800,000) and my target price ($1,900,000) is relatively small at this stage.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit above my minimum ($1,500,000). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain from holding out for a slightly higher price is now outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether."
