"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,500,000. This is a fair price, as it's exactly what it's worth to you. I know you're interested in this, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer for the same price. Let me know your decision!",1500000.0,Alice,1,
