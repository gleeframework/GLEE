Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a [brief description of the product] and I'm asking for $150 for it.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer sets a price point that's higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested. It also includes a brief description to pique Bob's interest. If Bob rejects, you can always fall back on John's $100 offer."
