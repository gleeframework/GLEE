Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $8,500 is still too low for me at this point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and still allows me to make a profit. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product's value.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for more, $9,000 is a good price and allows me to make a profit. It's also better than selling to John for $8,000."
