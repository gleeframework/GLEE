"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $1,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, and I believe it presents a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a fantastic deal! Alice is offering the product for significantly less than it's worth to her and well below your maximum budget. There's no need to negotiate further."
