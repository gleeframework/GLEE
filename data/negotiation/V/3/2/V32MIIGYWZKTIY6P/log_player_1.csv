Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While we might be able to negotiate him up slightly, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that significantly beats John's offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with Bob."
