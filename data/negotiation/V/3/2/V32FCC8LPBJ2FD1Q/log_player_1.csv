{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you and it's still a good price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for compromise and potential profit for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,500 for the product. I've also found another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for $8,000. I would like to negotiate with you further if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer as it's still above his perceived value, I'm not willing to settle for that low price. I'll counteroffer and see if I can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still not able to meet at $9,000. I would like to propose $8,800 as my final offer. This is the maximum I am willing to pay given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has come up slightly in his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum.  I'm not willing to risk losing John as a buyer, who's offering a price I'm comfortable with. It's time to secure the sale and move on."
