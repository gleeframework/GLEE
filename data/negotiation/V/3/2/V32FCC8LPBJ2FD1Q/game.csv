"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,500 for the product. I've also found another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for $8,000. I would like to negotiate with you further if possible.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still not able to meet at $9,000. I would like to propose $8,800 as my final offer. This is the maximum I am willing to pay given my budget constraints.",8800.0,Bob,4,
