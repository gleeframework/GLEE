"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to go down to $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
