,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $85?  It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $87.  Let's split the difference and make a deal.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $87. How about we meet in the middle at $89? This is a fair price, and it'll allow us to both walk away happy.",89.0,Alice,5,
