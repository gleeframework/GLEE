"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500, which is a good compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I like your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below $16,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $16,000, so I'm offering it to you for $16,250. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,5,
