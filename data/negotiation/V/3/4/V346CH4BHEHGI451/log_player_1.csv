{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential you see in it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. It also leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think it's a great opportunity, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best value for my money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum price.   It's better for me to sell to John and secure a much higher price."
