Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'm hoping to get. I'm confident I can get a better deal from Bob or potentially John. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,000,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to get closer to your initial offer, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. Can we discuss the value of the product and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $900,000 is a decent compromise.  It's a substantial amount, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob or John.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
