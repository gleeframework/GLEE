"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.  I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you as well. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,000,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to get closer to your initial offer, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. Can we discuss the value of the product and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price?",900000.0,Bob,4,
