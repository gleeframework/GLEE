Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. I'll offer him the product for $1,800,000. This is a relatively high price, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay it since I don't know what the product is worth to him.

Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I think I can get a better price for the product, and $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. I'll offer him the product for $1,600,000. This is a bit higher than his offer, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me in the middle.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 1600000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send the counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll accept Bob's offer. $1,500,000 is the minimum price I was willing to accept, and it's the same price that John is willing to pay. I'll sell the product to Bob for $1,500,000.
