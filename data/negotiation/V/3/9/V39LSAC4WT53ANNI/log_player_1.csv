Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $19,000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for us both."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Begin with an offer higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and your minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Gauge Interest:** The initial high price allows you to assess Bob's level of interest. If he's willing to negotiate, it suggests the product holds significant value for him.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, ensuring you won't settle for less than your minimum.  
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message indicates flexibility, making Bob more receptive to counter-offering.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while maintaining a fallback option if Bob rejects the initial offer."
