Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?  This product truly is worth the investment, and I want to see you benefit from it."", ""product_price"": 12750}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is firm on $12,000 and it's a significant profit above my minimum. It's better to secure the deal now than risk him walking away in later rounds."
