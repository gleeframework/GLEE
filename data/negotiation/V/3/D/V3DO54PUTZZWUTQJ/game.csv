"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value is worth no less than $800000 to me.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product's value. While I see the potential, $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000, considering the potential savings compared to John's offer. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's true value to me is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discounted price. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  Considering your statement about the product's true value, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $800000, which reflects a fair compromise and a significant savings for me compared to John's offer.  What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a fair price. However, I'm not willing to budge from my minimum price of $825000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm counteroffering at $815000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
