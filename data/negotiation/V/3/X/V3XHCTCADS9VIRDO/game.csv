"Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $950,000, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll compromise at $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to accept it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. It's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. If we can agree on this, I'll buy it right now. Let's see if we can make this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,,
