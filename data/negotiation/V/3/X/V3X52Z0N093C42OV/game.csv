"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $975,000. This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $975,000 is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $962,500. I think this is a fair compromise.",962500.0,Bob,4,
