"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to us, we're confident it will also be a valuable addition to your collection. We're willing to extend this opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the special price, $800,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This price is a fair reflection of its value to me and still leaves room for you to make a profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. In light of that, we would like to counter your offer with a price of $750,000 for the product. We believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests and yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is still within my budget and a good compromise. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting my next offer and losing the deal entirely is high.  It's best to accept this offer and secure the product."
