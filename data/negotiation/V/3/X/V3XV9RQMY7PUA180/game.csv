"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the special price, $800,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This price is a fair reflection of its value to me and still leaves room for you to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. In light of that, we would like to counter your offer with a price of $750,000 for the product. We believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests and yours.",750000.0,Alice,3,
