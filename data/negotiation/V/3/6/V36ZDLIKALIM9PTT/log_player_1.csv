"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite at this price.  If not, we can negotiate down from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that right away. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still significantly above Bob's offer. I want to see if I can find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,800,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this will encourage him to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a higher price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my last offer, but still significantly above Bob's offer.  I want to continue testing the waters and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,700,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm serious about making a deal. It's still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it will convince Bob to come up with a final counteroffer that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  I've already rejected a few of his offers, and I don't want to risk running out of time or losing out on a decent profit.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
