"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is quite high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still quite far from what I had in mind.  To make this work, I'd need to see a price closer to $750,000. This would be a significant investment for me, but I believe it's fair considering my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant price reduction and a fair offer considering its potential worth.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering John is offering me the same product at this price.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,6,
