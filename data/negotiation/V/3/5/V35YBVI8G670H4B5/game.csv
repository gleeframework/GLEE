"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being flexible. I'm interested in the product, but  $9500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $8200. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price! I'm still a bit hesitant at $8200. How about we split the difference and I pay $7600?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",7600.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8100. It's still a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $8100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'll go up to $7850.  I'm really interested in the product and believe this is a fair price for both of us.",7850.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $8000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $8050. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",8050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $8050 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7900 to make this deal happen. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",7900.0,Bob,8,
