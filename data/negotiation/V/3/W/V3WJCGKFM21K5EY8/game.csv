"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000. Let's see if we can make this work!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a bit more than $10,000.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is still a good deal for both of us, as you can make a profit and I can get the product for less than John's price. Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Bob,4,
