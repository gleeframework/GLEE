"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $125. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to move forward. Let's see if we can agree on this.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $150, which is the price I was initially willing to accept from John. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",150.0,Alice,5,
