"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable opportunity to acquire a rare and exclusive product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of this product, $25000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. It's a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18000 and $8000, which would be $13000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my willingness to compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to go up to $10000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and $10000, which would be $11500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're still holding out for a higher price. While I appreciate your position, I'm simply unable to go any higher than $10000.  This is my final offer, and it reflects the maximum I can spend.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement before we run out of time.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you the product for $12000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,9,
