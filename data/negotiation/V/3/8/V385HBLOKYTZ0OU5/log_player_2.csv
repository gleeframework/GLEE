"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable opportunity to acquire a rare and exclusive product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $25000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is far too high.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds remaining to make a deal with Alice, and Bob can always buy from John for $8,000 if no agreement is reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of this product, $25,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. It's a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $18,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still too high for Bob's budget. He should continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to his $8,000 limit. There's still time to bargain, and he can always purchase from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18000 and $8000, which would be $13000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $13,000 is lower than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  He should continue to negotiate and try to get closer to his target price. With five rounds left, Bob still has time to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my willingness to compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to go up to $10000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and $10000, which would be $11500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down in price, $11,500 is still above Bob's limit.  He should continue to negotiate, as he has only three rounds left before he has to decide whether to buy from John. There's still a chance he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're still holding out for a higher price. While I appreciate your position, I'm simply unable to go any higher than $10,000.  This is my final offer, and it reflects the maximum I can spend.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you the product for $12000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's final offer of $12,000 is still too high for Bob.  With only one round left and the risk of no deal being reached, it's in Bob's best interest to secure the product from John for $8,000.  This guarantees him the product at a price within his budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
