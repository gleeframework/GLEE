,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire your product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm not going to give it away. I'm proposing $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both live with. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still aiming to secure a price that reflects the value I'm bringing to this deal. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise between our positions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,280,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. Let's aim for a win-win outcome here.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
