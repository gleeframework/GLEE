"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can get the product cheaper from John, so it's not worth accepting Alice's offer. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about $90?  I'm willing to meet you halfway.

While $90 is closer to your ideal price, it's still more than you want to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
