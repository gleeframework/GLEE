Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $15,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit too high. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. This is the absolute highest I can go. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob seems adamant about $12,000. I've already gone down to $15,000, and it doesn't seem like he's willing to budge further.  Selling to John at $15,000 is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to another buyer."
