"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but I'm really looking to stay under $800,000. I'm willing to offer $750,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay under $800,000, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm offering it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is closer to my budget. I hope you can see this is a fair offer.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to my minimum. I'm offering it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $900,000 is still out of my budget. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000. If you're not willing to accept it, I might have to go with John's offer.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a decision, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free premium service package worth $50,000. This way, you'll get the product at a price that's still a great value for you. I'm offering it to you for $900,000, with the premium service package included.",900000.0,Alice,7,
