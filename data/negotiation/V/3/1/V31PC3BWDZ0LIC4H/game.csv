"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it can be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which I believe is fair considering its potential value to you. Let's discuss!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but it's still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  This represents a significant value for both of us and allows us to quickly move towards a deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $1,000,000 feels like a more reasonable middle ground that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find common ground!",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably offer right now.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value and allows us to finalize the deal quickly.  Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Bob,4,
