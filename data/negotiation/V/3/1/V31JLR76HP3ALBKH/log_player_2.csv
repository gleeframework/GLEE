"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product at a price of $14,000.  I believe this product will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price:** $13,250 is significantly lower than the original $14,000 and is getting closer to Bob's desired price point.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation:**  While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's a chance Alice will reject further counteroffers.  This could lead to a stalemate and force Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time is a factor:**  The negotiation process takes time and energy.  Accepting the offer at $13,250 is a good compromise that saves Bob $1,750 compared to John's price."
