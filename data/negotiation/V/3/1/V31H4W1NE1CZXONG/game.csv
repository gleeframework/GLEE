"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $800000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is $1200000.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $800000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and my limited resources. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1200000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
