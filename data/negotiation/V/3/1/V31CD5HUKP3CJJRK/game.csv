"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit while also being reasonable given the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I still believe it's a fair price given the product's value and my initial asking price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,025,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000 for the product.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still keeping my costs below my target.",975000.0,Bob,6,
