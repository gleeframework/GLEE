Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to save some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is reasonable, the product's value to me is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```
At this point, Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, but it's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting his offer of $9,750 is a good compromise to avoid risking the guaranteed $8,000 from John.
