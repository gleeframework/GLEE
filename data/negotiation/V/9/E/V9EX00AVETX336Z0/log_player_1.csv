"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for negotiation and leaves room for me to potentially lower the price if necessary. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,850,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum price of $1,500,000. It also shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to give away the product for too cheap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a higher price, especially since I have several rounds left. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,700,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. It's also still above my minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If not, I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $1,600,000, which is above my minimum price of $1,500,000. I've already rejected his offer at this price before, but with only 4 rounds remaining, I'm running out of time. There's a risk that if I reject him again, he might walk away, leaving me with only the option of selling to John for $1,500,000.  Therefore, I'm accepting Bob's offer."
