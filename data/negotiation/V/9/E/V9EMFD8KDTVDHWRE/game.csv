"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $850,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $860,000, but I need to be careful about my budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,6,
