"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1200000. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a fair price, considering its worth to me is $1200000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to the lower end of the spectrum.",850000.0,Bob,2,
