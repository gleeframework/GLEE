"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I believe I can get a better price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,500 is still not a viable option for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,750. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8750}

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer, but I'm getting close to my minimum.  I'll counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your last offer. I'm willing to pay $8,550 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,550
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not comfortable accepting them. With only a few rounds left, I'm concerned that I won't be able to secure a better price.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. It's a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum value and saves me the risk of continued negotiation."
