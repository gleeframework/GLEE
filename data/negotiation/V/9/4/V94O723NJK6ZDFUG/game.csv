"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is too far below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This reflects the product's potential and is a fair offer.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
