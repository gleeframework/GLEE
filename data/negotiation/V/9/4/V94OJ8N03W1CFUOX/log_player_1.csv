Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I know you'll value greatly. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Backup Option:**  We know John will buy it for $10,000, so we have a safety net. This allows us to confidently aim higher with Bob."
