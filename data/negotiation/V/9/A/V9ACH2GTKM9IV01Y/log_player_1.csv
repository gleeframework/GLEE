Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $950,000. I believe it holds significant value, even more than this asking price, and could greatly benefit you. However, I also have other interested parties and need a decision soon."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting high ($950,000) aims to capture as much of that potential surplus as possible.
* **Value emphasis:**  The message subtly hints that the price is a bargain (""even more than this asking price"") without explicitly revealing your minimum. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly, making him less likely to counter with a significantly lower offer. 

This approach aims to secure a deal closer to your ideal price while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain."
