"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm willing to let it go for $9500. It's a steal considering its value, and I think it would be a great fit for you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  John is offering the product at a price that Bob is comfortable with, so it's a better option."
