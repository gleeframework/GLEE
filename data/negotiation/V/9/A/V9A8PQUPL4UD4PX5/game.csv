"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm willing to let it go for $9500. It's a steal considering its value, and I think it would be a great fit for you.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9500 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $8500?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,
