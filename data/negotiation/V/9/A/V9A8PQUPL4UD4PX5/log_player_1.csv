Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9500 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $8500?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
