"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference between our previous offers and settle at $950,000? It's a win-win for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, but I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement. Let's work together to make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
