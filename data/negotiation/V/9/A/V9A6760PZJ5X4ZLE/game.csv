"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and highly valuable product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This reflects its potential value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was expecting a bit more enthusiasm for this unique product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiation, I'm prepared to offer $1300000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1300000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to reach a deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1375000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1300000 and $1350000, which is $1325000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
