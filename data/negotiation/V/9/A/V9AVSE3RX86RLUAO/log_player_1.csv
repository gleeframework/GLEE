"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $80 to Bob and at least $80 to me.  I'm hoping to get a little more than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
``` 

I'm countering with $88. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will be enough to get the deal done, but I'm still prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $82 is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept.  There's only a limited number of rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $82."
