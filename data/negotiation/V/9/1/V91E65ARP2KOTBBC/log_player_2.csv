"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $10,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  There's no reason to accept a worse deal right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident you'll find this price fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  It's better to continue negotiating and see if Alice will come down further, especially since Bob can always buy from John for $8,000 if he runs out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
