"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting because it's below the product's value to you, there's still room for negotiation.  You can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  There's always the safety net of buying from John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Alice fails."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is only $50,000 above your maximum budget of $1,300,000.  It's a small enough difference to make the purchase worthwhile, especially since it's still lower than the $1,400,000 she initially offered.  There's always the chance that you could get a better price in another round, but the risk of Alice walking away or her lowering the offer is too high. It's best to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
