Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. It's a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe there's room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and gauge his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm confident I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm countering with $9,750. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm still aiming for a good profit, but I'm also showing flexibility in my pricing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're very close in price now, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. $9,600 is a solid price that meets my minimum requirement and ensures a successful sale."
