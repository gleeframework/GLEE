"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer and your interest in the product. I understand your perspective on the value. However,  $900,000 falls significantly below my limit for this product. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to consider $1,150,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the inherent worth of what's being offered.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
