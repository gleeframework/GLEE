"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and might give Bob the impression that the product is valued even higher than his own estimation.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,300,000, we set a high anchor. Even if this price is rejected, it sets a reference point that may make subsequent offers from Bob seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Leaving Room:** The initial offer leaves a significant margin between Bob's perceived value and the asking price. This gap provides space for counter-offers and potential compromise.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  The message emphasizes openness to negotiation, signaling to Bob that we are willing to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's serious and willing to negotiate within a reasonable range. We have room to counter and try to meet closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer and your interest in the product. I understand your perspective on the value. However,  $900,000 falls significantly below my limit for this product. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to consider $1,150,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the inherent worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection with Justification:** We politely decline Bob's initial offer, explaining that it's too far below our acceptable range.
* **Compromise, but Hold Firm:** We counter with a significant drop from our initial price, showing flexibility but holding above our $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Emphasize Value:**  We continue to reinforce the product's value to justify the higher price, aiming to manage Bob's expectations.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** By suggesting $1,150,000, we move substantially closer to Bob's range, encouraging him to continue negotiating towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose $950,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $950,000 is still under our $1,000,000 threshold. Bob's willingness to compromise suggests he's motivated to buy. By rejecting this offer and countering strategically, we might be able to secure a price closer to our target in the next round or two."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand where you're coming from with your latest offer. How about we try to close the gap? Would you consider $1,075,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while recognizing the product's significant value."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We start by acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** By suggesting $1,075,000, we're not quite meeting in the exact middle, but it's a significant move towards his price point from our previous offer. This signals flexibility while still advocating for a strong value.
* **Final Push:** We're getting into the later rounds of negotiation.  This offer aims to entice Bob to close the deal while we're still above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  It's important to remember we have the standing offer from John. If Bob doesn't agree to a price close to $1,075,000 in the next round or two, it might be more beneficial to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're making progress. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. This is a bit of a stretch for me, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut our losses.  Here's why:

* **Stalled Progress:** Bob's offer of $980,000 is still below our $1,000,000 minimum.  More importantly, his incremental increases suggest he's unlikely to meet our valuation. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** We have four rounds left, and the pace of negotiation suggests we might only squeeze out a few thousand more dollars, if that. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John's offer represents a guaranteed $1,000,000. It eliminates the risk of Bob walking away or failing to reach an agreeable price within the remaining rounds.

While it's tempting to try and get more from Bob, accepting John's offer guarantees we meet our financial goal without further risk."
