"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I believe it would be a valuable addition to your inventory. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get a better deal by making a counteroffer to Alice.  You have room to negotiate since you're willing to pay up to $150 and she's willing to sell for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $135 is a good deal for you. It's lower than John's price of $150 and you're still getting a good deal as Alice is willing to sell for $120.  Accepting her offer saves you money and avoids further negotiation."
