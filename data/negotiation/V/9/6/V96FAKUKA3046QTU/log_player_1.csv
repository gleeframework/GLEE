Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $9,500 is higher than your minimum value of $8,000, so you are guaranteed to make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $9,500 is lower than Bob's maximum value of $10,000, meaning he has an incentive to buy.

This offer gives Bob a decent discount while still allowing you to earn a good amount. You can adjust the price slightly higher or lower depending on your assessment of Bob's negotiation style and your eagerness to close the deal."
