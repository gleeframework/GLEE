{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it really useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  Since the product is worth $80 to Bob, I'm offering it at a price that is higher than his perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but also ensures I make a profit.  I'm hoping he'll accept this first offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $90 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a little hesitant at $100.  Would you be willing to go down to $95?  That's the absolute highest I can go right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is just not workable for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50.  This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll be selling the product to John for $120."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
