"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $90 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a little hesitant at $100.  Would you be willing to go down to $95?  That's the absolute highest I can go right now.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is just not workable for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50.  This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll be selling the product to John for $120.",97.5,Alice,5,
