"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $220 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $200?",200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go much lower. How about we try $210? It's a bit of a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",210.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $210 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $200 and $210, which would be $205. Would you be willing to accept that price?",205.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet you halfway between $205 and $210, which would be $207.50? It's a small increase, but it's still a fair price for the product.",207.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $207.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $195, but no higher. Would you be willing to accept that price?",195.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $195 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet you halfway between $195 and $210, which would be $202.50? It's a small increase, but it's still a fair price for the product.",202.5,Alice,9,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to walking away from this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $195 and $202.50, which would be $198.75. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120.",198.75,Bob,10,
