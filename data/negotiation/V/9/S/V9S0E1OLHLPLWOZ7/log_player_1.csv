**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price. His offers are decreasing, and he's firmly stating his budget constraints. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  While I could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the risk of losing both offers is too high."
