It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price. You can still get a good deal if you can bring the price down a bit."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do see the value in this product, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is a price I'm comfortable with.  It's still cheaper than buying from John, and I'm happy to close the deal."
