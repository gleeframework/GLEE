Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point:

* **High offer:**  $100 is a starting point that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially earn more. 
* **Friendly message:** Keeping the tone positive and encouraging can help build rapport with Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message clearly implies you're open to negotiation, which can encourage Bob to counteroffer.

Remember, the key is to start high but be prepared to lower the price if needed to close the deal."
