"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good chunk of the value Bob sees in the product.  This leaves room for negotiation, but also shows I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'll counter with my own offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still staying significantly above Bob's initial counteroffer. This shows flexibility, but also that I'm not willing to give up on a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still not ideal, it's only $50,000 less than my last counteroffer. I'm nearing the middle ground and it's risky to keep pushing with only 6 rounds left. There's a good chance we won't reach a higher price, and I'd rather secure the deal than risk ending up with John's lower offer."
