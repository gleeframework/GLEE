"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offer is significantly higher than my budget and what I could get it for from John. I need to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $5,000."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. It's a significant jump down from her initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly below my alternative option of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $5,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and a good deal considering the value of the product to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $9,000 is better, it's still above my ideal price and what John is offering.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, how about $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm inching closer to a price that would be a good deal for me while still leaving some room for negotiation before reaching John's price. This counter-offer shows Alice I'm serious about buying but still need her to move a bit on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I can't go as low as $6,500, but I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has met my ideal price and is now matching what I can get from John. There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation, as I won't get a better deal."
