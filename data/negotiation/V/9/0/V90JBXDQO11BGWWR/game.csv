"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,100,000 is certainly appealing, I'm holding out for something closer to $1,350,000. I'm confident that the value this product brings justifies that price point. Are you open to meeting somewhere in the middle?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise further if needed.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
