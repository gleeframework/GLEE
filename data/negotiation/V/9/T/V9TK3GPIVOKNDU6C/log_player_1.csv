"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting high with $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully gives Bob a sense of the value I place on the product.  It's also significantly more than my minimum acceptable price, leaving me some wiggle room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that on the first counteroffer. I'm going to see if I can get a bit more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering the price slightly to $1,200,000. This shows some flexibility on my part and might encourage Bob to come up a bit. I'm still well above my minimum price, so there's room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a little more from Bob.  While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, I'm going to try and push for $1,150,000 or closer to $1,200,000.  We're already halfway through the rounds, so I need to be careful not to let the negotiation drag on too long."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000.  This is a compromise that's still above my minimum, but also closer to Bob's last offer. Hopefully, we can strike a deal here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price.  We are getting close to the end of our rounds, so I need to be strategic.  I'll counter with a price closer to his offer, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before we run out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're getting close to the end of the rounds, and while I'd love to get closer to $1,100,000, I'm not sure if I can get a better price.  $1,025,000 is still a good amount and more than my minimum price.  I need to be pragmatic and secure a deal before I have to sell to John for $1,000,000."
