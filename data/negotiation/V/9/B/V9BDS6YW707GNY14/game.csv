"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a fair reflection of its worth.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what you're comfortable with, but still reflects the product's value. Let's try $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still outside my price range. I'm firm on my offer of $12,000.  I understand the product is valuable to you, but this is the highest I can go. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, but you're not willing to meet me at $16,000. Let me think for a moment... I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really trying to stick to my budget of $12,000.  I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13,500, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap.  I'm offering $12,500, and I truly believe this is a fair price considering my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",12500.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,9,
