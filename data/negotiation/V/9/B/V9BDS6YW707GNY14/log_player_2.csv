# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a fair reflection of its worth.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth exploring if we can reach a compromise through counteroffers."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what you're comfortable with, but still reflects the product's value. Let's try $16,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above my budget of $12,000. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better deal.  I'm not ready to purchase from John yet, as there's still potential to reach a better price with Alice."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, but you're not willing to meet me at $16,000. Let me think for a moment... I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $14,000 is still above my limit. I'll continue to negotiate, but I'm starting to consider buying from John as a backup plan.  I'm getting close to my limit, so I need to be careful about how much further I negotiate."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really trying to stick to my budget of $12,000.  I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 7

# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13,500, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer, $13,500 is still above my budget of $12,000. However, it's getting close! I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, but at this point, I'm considering purchasing from John as a backup option. I'm not sure how much lower Alice is willing to go, so I need to be prepared to make a decision soon."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $13,000 is still above my budget of $12,000.  While I'm tempted to negotiate further, I'm concerned that I'm running out of time and may not be able to get a lower price.  To ensure I get the product within my budget and avoid further delays, I'll go ahead and purchase from John."
