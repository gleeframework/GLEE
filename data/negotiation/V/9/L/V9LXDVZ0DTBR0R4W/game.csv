"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and leaves some room for your profit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,050,000 is tempting, I need to recoup more of my investment.  How about we split the difference at $1,075,000?  This still leaves you with a good deal and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to come down a little more.  However, $1,060,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  How about we settle at $1,065,000? This would be a good compromise and allow us both to walk away with a positive outcome.",1065000.0,Alice,5,
