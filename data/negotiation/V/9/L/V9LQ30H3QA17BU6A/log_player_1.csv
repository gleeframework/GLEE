"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your operations, a real game-changer.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.  I think that's a fair price considering the potential return on investment you'll see."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While I know Bob values the product at $800,000, I want to start high to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for the price (even if slightly vague) makes it seem less arbitrary and might make Bob more receptive.
* **Leaving Room for John:** I'm starting significantly lower than John's offer because I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob quickly and avoid the risk of extended negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your generosity, I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a significant jump from his perceived value of $800,000. While $950,000 is a good price, I believe there's still room for negotiation to bridge the gap further. I'm willing to continue the negotiation for now, as I'm confident I can get closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we settle at $1,050,000?  I think that reflects the true value of what this product can do for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and showing flexibility by coming down in price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. It's a significant decrease from my initial offer but still keeps me above the $1,000,000 mark.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value proposition to justify the higher price point and potentially sway Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. I propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a strong price and meets my goal of exceeding his perceived value. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher amount, the difference is not substantial enough to risk losing the deal. Accepting now guarantees a significant profit and avoids potential complications or delays from further negotiation rounds."
