I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and make a quick sale, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can push Bob a little higher."

Bob is firm at his price, and I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to get much higher. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed sale to John.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's the best I can do at this point."
