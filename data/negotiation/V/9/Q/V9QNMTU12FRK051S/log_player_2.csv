"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd save $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* **While the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, your goal is to save money, not maximize Alice's profit.**  The fact that she's willing to sell for $900,000 means there's still room for you to get a good deal."
