"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can get more. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $18,000.  This is a compromise, but it still allows me to make a profit significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is a decent price, and it's getting close to my original offer. I'm confident that I can find a better deal with another buyer if I keep going, but at this point, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  $16,500 is a good profit, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
