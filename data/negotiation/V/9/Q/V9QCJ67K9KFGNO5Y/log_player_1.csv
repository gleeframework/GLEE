Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $18000 is a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $10000 to make this work. Would you be willing to consider that?
