{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price ($15,000) as possible, but I'm also willing to negotiate. By starting at $12,000, I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, which could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop so low.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for us to find a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
