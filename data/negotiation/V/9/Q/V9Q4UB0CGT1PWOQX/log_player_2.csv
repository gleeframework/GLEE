"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's starting price is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",

}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. There's a good chance she'll counter, giving me more information to work with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for us to find a mutually agreeable price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has met my ideal price. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as they both offer the product at $10,000."
