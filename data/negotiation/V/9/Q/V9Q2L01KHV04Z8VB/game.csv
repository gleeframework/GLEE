"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, how about we settle on $92 for the product? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but still reasonable.",92.0,Alice,5,
