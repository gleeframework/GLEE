"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that's worth $1500000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $1200000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. I'm confident we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1175000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1175000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $1050000. Let's try $1087500. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept?",1087500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're still trying to negotiate, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1087500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $1175000, which is $1087500. But I can do one better. I'll meet you halfway from your new offer of $1087500, which is $1087250. But I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1087250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1050000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already rejected your offer at $1050000 once, Bob. I'm not willing to go back to that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I'll sell the product to you for $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm not budging from this price.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer of $1075000, which is $1037500. I'm hoping we can finally meet at this price.",1037500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the price I'd be willing to sell to John for. I'm not willing to go as low as $1037500. I'll meet you halfway from my last offer of $1075000, which is $1052500. But I'm not going any higher than that. This is my final offer, and I'm not budging from this price.",1052500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've made it to the final round. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm not going any higher. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1000000.0,Bob,10,
