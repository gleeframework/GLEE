"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider a price adjustment?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, though. How about $10,500?  This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
