"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $130.  It's a fair price for both of us and I'm ready to make a deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $132? It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise to make a deal with you.",132.0,Alice,5,
