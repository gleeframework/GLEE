"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product is valuable to me, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm happy to pay $1,050,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,150,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. This price still reflects the value the product holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. $1,150,000 is closer, but unfortunately still a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is a very fair compromise for both of us. This would allow you to gain a significant return, while staying within my budget.  Let's close this deal!",1100000.0,Bob,4,

I believe this price reflects the value the product holds for you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point. Let's work together to make it happen!",1120000.0,Alice,5,
