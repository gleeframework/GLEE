Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product is valuable to me, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm happy to pay $1,050,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
