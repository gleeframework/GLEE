"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $110 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $65 is far below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm willing to compromise to make this work.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I appreciate the compromise Alice. How about we settle at $75?  That feels like a fair deal to me.,75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $75 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to go down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $85 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you do $78?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle on $81? This is the best I can do, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.",81.0,Alice,7,
