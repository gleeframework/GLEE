"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is the maximum value I'm willing to go. Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $12,500 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $10,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
