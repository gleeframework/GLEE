"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high initial price, framing it as an investment rather than just a purchase. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting high, I aim to:
    * Anchor the negotiation around a higher number.
    * Potentially uncover if Bob values the product even more than $800,000. 
    * Leave room for strategic concessions in later rounds.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still allowing for a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, considering my budget constraints and the current market situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is quite tempting as it's above his perceived value and close to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept just yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push the price closer to my initial ask. I'm willing to take a calculated risk in the next round to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  While I recognize the value this product brings to your specific needs, the price of $1,400,000 undervalues its broader market potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this revised offer represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from $2,200,000 to $1,900,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:**  I'm subtly shifting the focus from Bob's perceived value to the product's ""broader market potential."" This reinforces the idea that the product has value beyond his immediate needs, justifying the higher price.
* **Holding Ground:**  I'm still holding firm above the $1,500,000 mark, aiming to capture a significant portion of the value this product holds for me.

This counteroffer maintains a balance between being open to negotiation and ensuring I don't undervalue the product. It keeps the door open for Bob to make a counter-proposal while inching closer to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given your proposal careful consideration, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still constrained by my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now firmly above my minimum acceptable price and represents a substantial profit. While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the negotiations could stall. Accepting this offer secures a significant gain and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
