,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Given the product's unique features and potential, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the unique benefits of this product and the value it brings, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This would be a significant compromise on my part, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects both our needs. What are your thoughts?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,6,
