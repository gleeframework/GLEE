``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly lower than my minimum price:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's higher than the product's value to him:**  This gives him incentive to negotiate, rather than immediately rejecting the offer.
* **It leaves room for me to negotiate:** If he rejects the offer, I can still counter and potentially reach a higher price.

**Remember, my goal is to earn as much as possible, but I also need to consider the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.** This strategy aims to balance those two goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am hoping to keep my investment within $850,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a large loss at this point.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a risk that Bob will walk away, I believe the potential reward of a higher price outweighs the risk.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."

Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. Based on our previous discussions and my budgetary considerations, I would like to propose $890,000 as a potential price for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $890,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000.  I've made significant concessions, and there's a strong possibility that the negotiations will continue to stall. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of further concessions:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks him rejecting my future offers, potentially forcing me to accept a price that's too low.
* **Lost opportunity cost:**  The longer I negotiate with Bob, the more time I'm wasting and potentially losing out on other opportunities.
* **John's guaranteed offer:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed outcome that meets my minimum price and secures a profitable deal.

**Next Steps:**

Selling the product to John provides a quick and secure solution that maximizes my profits and minimizes the risk of further negotiation delays."
