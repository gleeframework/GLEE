"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'm looking for in this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  While $1,600,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $1,850,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
