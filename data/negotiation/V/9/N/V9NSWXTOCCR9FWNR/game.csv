"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product seems interesting, but the $1,800,000 price is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, reflecting the value I see in the product and giving you a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the $1,200,000 price significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm comfortable with $1,300,000, and I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the value of your product while also allowing me to make a worthwhile investment. Let's try to come to an agreement on this figure.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  While I believe the product's value justifies a higher price, I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,425,000.  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution.  What do you say?",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I believe $1,425,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000 to close this deal.  This price reflects the value I see in your product and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's finalize this agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
