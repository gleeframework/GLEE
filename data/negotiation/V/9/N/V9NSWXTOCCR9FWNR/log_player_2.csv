"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is far too high. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems interesting, but the $1,800,000 price is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, reflecting the value I see in the product and giving you a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the $1,200,000 price significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. While she's willing to meet halfway, it's still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm comfortable with $1,300,000, and I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the value of your product while also allowing me to make a worthwhile investment. Let's try to come to an agreement on this figure."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  While I believe the product's value justifies a higher price, I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,425,000.  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000

Alice is coming down, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I believe $1,425,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000 to close this deal.
