"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us. You know it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down from my asking price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  He can get the product from John for $800,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
