Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000. This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for potential negotiation if Alice is willing to compromise. It's also a clear signal of my financial limits, and forces Alice to consider my position."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still too high. We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm determined to get the best possible price.  I'm confident that I can secure a more favorable deal by continuing to negotiate."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating a genuine attempt to meet Alice halfway.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is actually higher than her initial offer. It's clear that she's not willing to budge on price. We are in the final round, and I need to make a decision.  While I would like to get the product from Alice for a lower price, it's not worth risking it. John's offer is within my budget, and it's guaranteed. It's the most logical choice at this point."
