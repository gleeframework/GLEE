"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground here.",15000.0,Alice,3,
