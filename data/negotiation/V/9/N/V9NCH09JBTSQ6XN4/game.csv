"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept at this stage.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price. How about we settle on $1,125,000? This would allow us both to find common ground.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. I think this is a fair compromise that could work for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints, but $1,075,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to make one last compromise.  Let's close this deal at $1,100,000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
