"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit too high for me. How about $110?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $120.  That's the absolute most I can do, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product for me.",120.0,Bob,4,
