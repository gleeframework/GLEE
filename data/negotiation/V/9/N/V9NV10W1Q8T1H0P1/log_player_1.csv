{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a price that is higher than your minimum but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate. It also emphasizes the product's value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum you are willing to accept, there's still a chance to get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can do $8500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to your desired price point and a significant improvement over his previous offer. It's a good deal for you considering you could sell to John for $8,000."
