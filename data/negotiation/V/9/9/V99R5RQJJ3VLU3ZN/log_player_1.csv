"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so I want to see if I can get a good profit."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is a good price, I believe I can get more. I'll counter with a lower offer in the next round."

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and we are already in round 4.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price. I'll accept Bob's offer."
