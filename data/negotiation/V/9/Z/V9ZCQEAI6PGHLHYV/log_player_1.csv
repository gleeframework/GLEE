Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $150 as possible, but she also wants to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $140 gives Bob a significant discount ($40 off) while still earning Alice a good profit. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** This approach balances the desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the sale to Bob and having to settle for $150 from John."
