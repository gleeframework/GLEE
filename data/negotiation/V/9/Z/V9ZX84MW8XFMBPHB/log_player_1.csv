"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob than $1,000,000, but I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While I want to get the best price possible, I'm not desperate enough to sell for $800,000.  I'll counter offer, and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth a lot more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum than his previous offer, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm not willing to settle for just $100,000 more than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a reasonable price for both of us, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this price. It's closer to his offer, but still higher than what John would offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than his previous offer, I'm still not willing to settle for just $50,000 more than what John is offering. I think there's room to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above what John is offering. This shows I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum. I'm hoping this final offer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum, but I only have 2 rounds left.  If I reject and he doesn't increase his offer, I risk ending up with nothing.  I'm going to sell to John and guarantee myself $1,000,000."
