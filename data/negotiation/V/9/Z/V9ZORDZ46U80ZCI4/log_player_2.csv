"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to him, and Alice's offer is higher than that.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, hoping to get Alice to come down from her initial price.  This is a bold move, but it signals Bob's serious intent to negotiate and potentially get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is coming down, but still above Bob's desired price. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. It's likely that Alice is willing to go lower, and he still has room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to his maximum. He's hoping that Alice will be more receptive to a price closer to $1,500,000 after rejecting his previous lower offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer. It's likely that if Bob rejects this offer, Alice will come back with a counteroffer that's even closer to Bob's maximum. At this point, it's worth taking the offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a higher price."
