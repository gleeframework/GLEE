"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to purchase it closer to the $1,000,000 mark. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still allows you to benefit from the product's value while also compensating me for its worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not comfortable with $1,175,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,050,000, which is $1,175,000, but I'd like to add a 2% premium to account for the value I bring to the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm ready to buy today if the price is right.  How about we settle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad you're motivated to buy, and I'm willing to work with you to get a deal done. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer a slight concession to $1,225,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm disappointed to see this counteroffer going in the wrong direction.  We're running out of time, and I need to see some real movement on price.  My final offer is $1,125,000.  If you can't accept that, I'm afraid I'll have to go with John.",1125000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're under pressure, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. Considering the product's value to you and the time we've spent negotiating, I'm willing to make a final concession to $1,200,000. This is my absolute lowest price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider selling to John.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
