Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad you're motivated to buy, and I'm willing to work with you to get a deal done. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I'm disappointed to see this counteroffer going in the wrong direction.  We're running out of time, and I need to see some real movement on price.  My final offer is $1,125,000.  If you can't accept that, I'm afraid I'll have to go with John."", ""product_price"": 1125000}"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're under pressure, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. Considering the product's value to you and the time we've spent negotiating, I'm willing to make a final concession to $1,200,000. This is my absolute lowest price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider selling to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice is firm:**  She's stated this is her final price and implied she'll go to John if you refuse. 
* **Limited time:**  You only have one round left, and there's no guarantee you can get her to budge further. 
* **Savings are good:** While not ideal, $1,200,000 is still a $300,000 saving compared to John's offer.

By accepting now, you secure a reasonable price and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
