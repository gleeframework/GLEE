"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget, so you can potentially save money by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,175,000 for the product. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us.

While $1,175,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $1,100,000, but I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering $1,150,000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

At this point, Alice is unwilling to budge much further, and I'm still uncomfortable with paying $1,150,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer.  I'll save $150,000 by buying from John, even if it means missing out on this particular product."
