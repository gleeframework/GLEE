"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow me to acquire the product within my desired range.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,175,000 for the product. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair offer that reflects the value I place on it and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $1,100,000, but I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering $1,150,000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
