"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120. Alice is offering the product for $110. This is a good price, but you can try to get it lower.  By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $100?  I'm really interested in this product."", ""product_price"": 100}
