"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a minimum of $17,000 to be comfortable. How about $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
