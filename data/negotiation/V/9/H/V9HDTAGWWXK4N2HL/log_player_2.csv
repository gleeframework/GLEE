# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer

$120 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and significantly cheaper than buying from John for $150."
