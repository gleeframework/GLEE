Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 4

Round 6

I'm going to sell to John. Even though Bob is offering a higher price than John, it's still below my desired minimum.  With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better offer from Bob.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
