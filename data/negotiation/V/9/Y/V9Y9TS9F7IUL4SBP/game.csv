,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $16000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you a price of $17500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think, Bob?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $15000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this price?",15000.0,Bob,6,
