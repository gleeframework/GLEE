"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it at $22,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget considerations, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
