"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to consider that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $110 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $125, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $115 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finally close the deal. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,5,
