Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Strategy:**  This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation. It leaves room for counteroffers while still giving me a good starting point. 

I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if Bob isn't willing to negotiate. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept since it's more than Bob's perceived value, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation. I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, which gives me leverage to push for a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I think is a fair price given the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing the product's value.  I'm also demonstrating my willingness to compromise to reach a deal.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to close the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price. 

I'm still prepared to sell to John for $15,000 if Bob doesn't meet my counteroffer, but I'm optimistic that we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $11000 is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 than my previous counteroffer of $11,000. While it's still lower than I'd like, it's a good compromise.  Accepting his offer allows me to secure a sale without having to risk going back and forth further, which could lead to a deal falling through. 

It's important to remember that I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, but the risk with that is that Bob might walk away completely.  By accepting Bob's offer, I can guarantee a sale and secure a decent profit."
