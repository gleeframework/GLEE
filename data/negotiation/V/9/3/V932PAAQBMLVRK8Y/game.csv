"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm keen on the product but $1,350,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
