{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but still lower than the product's worth to Bob. This should incentivize Bob to accept, but also allows for some counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $85? It's still a great price for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $78 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  It's better to go with the guaranteed $80 from John."
