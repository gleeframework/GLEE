"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $12000. How about we compromise at $14000? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that. How about we meet you halfway between $11500 and my original offer of $15000? I'm willing to sell it to you for $13000.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not going to give up yet, Bob! I think we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but I need you to commit to the sale. If you're willing to pay that price, I'll make sure the deal is done today.",12000.0,Alice,9,
