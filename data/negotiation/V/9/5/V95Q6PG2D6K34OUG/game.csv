"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,
