Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $20,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to move much higher and it's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to risk getting even less from Bob."
