Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still more than the product is worth to you. You should aim for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $105, which is still within my budget and a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly lower than her original offer.  I'm still aiming to save more money.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $110. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still seeking a good deal.  It's also a reasonable price for both of us, as it's closer to Alice's desired price point while still saving me money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to my desired price, it's still more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm still hoping to negotiate a lower price with Alice. I'm not desperate to buy the product, and I have the option of buying it from John for $150 if I need to. I'll see if I can get Alice to come down further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $115. This demonstrates that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also sticking to my limit.  I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for Alice to accept. If she rejects it, I'll be forced to seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is getting closer to my maximum price but still higher than I'm willing to pay at this point. We are now nearing the end of the negotiation with only three rounds left. I don't want to risk Alice making a final counteroffer that is even higher than this one.  To avoid that risk and secure the product at a reasonable price, I'm going to buy it from John for $150.  While it's not ideal, it's the best way to guarantee I get the product and avoid further negotiation."
