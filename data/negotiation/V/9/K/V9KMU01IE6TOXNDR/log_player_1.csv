{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and hoping to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value while still being reasonable. I'm also trying to be positive and emphasize the value of the product to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking $95 would be a more comfortable price for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $95 is only $5 below my minimum.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether."
