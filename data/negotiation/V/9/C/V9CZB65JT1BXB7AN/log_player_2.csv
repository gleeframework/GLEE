"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd be a great buyer for it.  I'm asking for $90, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is asking for $90.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $90 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $87.50?  That seems fair to us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $87.50 is closer to your target price, it's still more than what you're willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $87.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $86.  If you're not able to accept that, I may have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 86}
