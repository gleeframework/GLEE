"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it's really valuable, so I'm initially offering it at $160. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give ourselves room for negotiation.
* **Expressing Interest:**  While lowballing, it's important to show we're serious and interested in finding a price that works.
* **Setting the Stage:** This counter-offer aims to bring Alice closer to our desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $140 is better than $160, but it's still significantly more than our $100 budget and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice has shown a willingness to come down on price, suggesting further negotiation might be fruitful. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have John's offer as a backup, so there's no pressure to accept a price we're uncomfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $140 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. Would you be open to $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** We're incrementally increasing our offer to demonstrate willingness to compromise.
* **Targeting the Range:** $95 puts us within striking distance of our $100 limit. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will give us a better read on how low Alice is willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $95.  To be fair, how about we settle at $120?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her best price.
* **Over Budget:**  $120 still exceeds our $100 budget.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John offers the product at $100, ensuring we stay within budget and avoid further negotiation."
