"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in your product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer. How about $125? That's still a fair price for a product worth $120 to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in buying your product but $125 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $115?  It's a good compromise and we can close the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $115 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference at $120? That's fair to both of us and we can close this deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
