Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a bit more than the product's value to me ($80), but I'm not setting a price that's unreasonable for Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $75 is a little lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference at $82.50?  That way we're both getting a good deal."", ""product_price"": 82.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get a bit more, Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further.  It's better to take the guaranteed $80 from John than risk another round of negotiation with Bob."
