"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll really appreciate.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, given its value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price. While I'm aware he's willing to pay $120, I don't want to immediately settle for the minimum.  I'll see if I can get closer to my ideal price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90 to meet you halfway. This is a great product, and I think it's worth the investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm trying to find a price that is fair to both of us.  This offer is still higher than my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is close enough to my minimum price of $80. Given that I only have 6 rounds left, accepting his offer is the best course of action. There's a risk of going back and forth with more counteroffers, and potentially ending up selling to John for $80, which is the same as Bob's offer. It's best to secure the deal now and avoid any potential delays or complications."
