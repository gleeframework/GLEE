"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle for $100?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to go as low as $95?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $95 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get.  How about we meet in the middle again at $97.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $97.50 is the best price for me. Would you be willing to go as low as $92?,92.0,Bob,6,
