Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I want a high price, starting at $150 leaves no room for Bob to counter-offer.  A slightly lower price might make him feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it for $150 immediately might make Bob think I'm desperate to sell. By offering a slightly lower price, it seems like I'm willing to negotiate.

It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer since the product is only worth $80 to him. However, it maximizes the potential profit if Bob surprisingly decides to accept. If he rejects the offer, I can sell to John without losing any money."
