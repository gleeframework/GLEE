"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth $1,200,000 to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree that the product looks promising, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value is worth $1,200,000 to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we settle on $700,000? That's a fair compromise between our two positions.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value is worth $1,200,000 to you, and it's a reasonable compromise between our previous offers.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $750,000. I can offer it to you for $800,000. This is a final compromise that I'm willing to make to close the deal.",800000.0,Alice,7,
