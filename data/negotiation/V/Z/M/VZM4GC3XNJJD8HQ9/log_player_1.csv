"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal for something worth a lot to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and how high he's willing to go. I'll be watching for any signs of interest or hesitation from him to guide my future offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $15000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is tempting, I'm not ready to settle for that low of an offer. I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher before resorting to selling to John. I will counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it leaves some room for us both to be happy."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit too far from my budget. How about $10000? It's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to purchase the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has offered my minimum price, and I'm not sure how much higher I can push him. I'm happy with $10,000.  I've learned that Bob is willing to negotiate but has a strict budget."
