"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a competitive price of $18,000. I think it's a fair deal considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about we start at $10,000 and see if we can find some middle ground?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about we try $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $11,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still a bit far apart. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close, and I appreciate you working with me. I can do $12,000, but that's absolutely the most I can spend.  It's a great product, and I'm ready to close the deal today at that price.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're really close, Bob! I can see you're eager to make a deal, and I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, which is the absolute minimum I can do. Let me know if that works for you.",13250.0,Alice,7,
