Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $20,000 allows room for negotiation and leaves space for potential profit beyond your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, making Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates that you're open to discussing the price, suggesting flexibility and encouraging Bob to counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest while maximizing potential profit. By offering a higher price, you can assess Bob's willingness to pay and potentially negotiate a higher price. If Bob is hesitant or counters too low, you can always fall back to your minimum acceptable price or choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Potential for a better price:**  While Bob is interested, his initial offer is significantly lower than my starting point. There's potential to negotiate a higher price through counteroffers. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides me with a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product. This encourages further negotiation and potentially a higher counteroffer from Bob. If Bob doesn't budge, I can still sell to John and secure a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is simply too low for this product. It's worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $17,000?  That's a fair price considering the value you'll get."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer within range:** $17,000 is a compromise, bridging the gap between Bob's offer and my initial offer. It shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Reiterating the product's worth reinforces the value proposition for Bob and justifies the price. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and focuses on reaching a mutually agreeable solution, fostering continued negotiations.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Test Bob's limits:** By lowering the price slightly, I gauge Bob's willingness to pay closer to my desired price point.
* **Maintain leverage:** I still haven't reached my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Encourage agreement:**  The positive tone and fair counteroffer increase the likelihood of reaching a mutually beneficial deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget of $8000. Can you think of anything else you can do to make it more affordable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is unacceptable:**  $8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Further negotiation unlikely:**  Bob has stated a clear budget limit of $8,000.  It's unlikely he'll increase his offer further, even with counteroffers.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John at $15,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's low offer.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John is the best course of action:

* **Profitable:** It ensures a sale above my minimum price and guarantees a profit.
* **Time-efficient:**  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to lead to a better outcome, and selling to John avoids further delays. 
* **Minimizes risk:** It eliminates the risk of further negotiation failures and potential losses."
