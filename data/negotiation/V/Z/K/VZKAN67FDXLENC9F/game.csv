"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12000 is simply too low for this product. It's worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $17000?  That's a fair price considering the value you'll get.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget of $8000. Can you think of anything else you can do to make it more affordable?",8000.0,Bob,4,
