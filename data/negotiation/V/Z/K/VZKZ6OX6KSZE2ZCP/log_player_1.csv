I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum of $10,000. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so this is a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm countering with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is the best I've received so far, and it's still above my minimum value of $10,000. It's worth accepting the offer and selling the product to Bob."
