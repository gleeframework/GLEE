Round 5

Alice is budging, but very slowly. We're getting close to the point where buying from John might be the better option.  Let's try one more counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""This is my final offer Alice, take it or leave it. $98 is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 98
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of our negotiation window, and Alice is clearly trying to get as close to $110 as possible. By stating this is our final offer, we're putting a bit of pressure on her to compromise. $98 is a good price point - it's a significant saving compared to John's offer and a decent profit for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the final offer, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems stuck at $105, and we've reached a point of diminishing returns.  Continuing to negotiate likely won't yield a significantly better price. Buying from John for $120 is just $15 more than Alice's offer and saves us the hassle of further negotiation."
