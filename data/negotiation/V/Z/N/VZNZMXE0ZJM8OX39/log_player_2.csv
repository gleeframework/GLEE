Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,200 is better than $9,000, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. You're still in a good position because you've already shown Alice that you're interested in the product and you're willing to negotiate."

# Alice's message: I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to make a good offer. I can meet you at $9000, which is the same price I initially offered, but I'm willing to give you a slight discount this time. Let's meet in the middle at $9000.

**Explanation:**

Alice has come back to her initial offer. While this is a good price for you, it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal. You've shown Alice that you're willing to negotiate and she's clearly willing to work with you.  One more counteroffer might get you to a price you're both happy with."
