"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I believe there might be room for negotiation. Given my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $1000000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still looking to keep the price closer to my initial budget. I would like to propose a price of $1200000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
