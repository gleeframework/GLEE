{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage a positive response.  I'm aiming for a good starting point that allows for negotiation while keeping my minimum value in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe I can't exceed $12,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
