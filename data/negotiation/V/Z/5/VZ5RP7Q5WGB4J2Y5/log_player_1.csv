Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe it's a fair reflection of its worth and potential. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" and ""worth"" of the product, you subtly anchor Bob's perception to a higher price point.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you have John as a backup, you don't want to reveal this to Bob immediately. It weakens your negotiating position.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""Let me know what you think"" implies a willingness to discuss the price further, keeping the door open for Bob to counter-offer."
