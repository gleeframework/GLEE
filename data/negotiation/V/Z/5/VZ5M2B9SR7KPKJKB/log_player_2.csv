"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's better than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **Rejecting allows negotiation:** By rejecting, you open the door for Alice to potentially lower her price. 
* **John is the fallback:** If Alice won't budge, you can always buy from John, but it's not ideal."
