"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $14,000 is close to my limit, there's room for negotiation. Alice is motivated to sell, and I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right. A counteroffer gives me the opportunity to secure a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, aiming to move the negotiation closer to my target price. However, it's still above Alice's value, giving her room to counter while allowing me to gauge her willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand it's a bit lower than my initial proposal, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,500? This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving towards my price range, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming to pay as close to $11,000 as possible. By rejecting this offer, I signal my firmness while encouraging her to drop the price further.  I'm still willing to walk away if necessary and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm nudging the price closer to my target while acknowledging Alice's concessions. This counteroffer maintains a firm stance while showing I'm serious about buying if the price is right.  It also avoids insulting her with a lowball offer after she already lowered her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $12,000. This is a fair compromise, and it ensures we both walk away satisfied. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** $12,000 represents a good compromise.  I've managed to save $2,000 from Alice's initial offer and $3,000 compared to John's price. Further haggling might be counterproductive, potentially jeopardizing the deal. This offer allows me to acquire the product at a significant discount while respecting Alice's need to make a reasonable profit."
