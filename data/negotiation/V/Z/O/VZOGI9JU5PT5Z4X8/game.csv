"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very beneficial for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested, but only if we can get closer to $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. Could you do $14,000?  That's a substantial reduction on my initial price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I could potentially go up to $7,000.  Would that be acceptable?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about $11,000? This is a significant price cut, and I wouldn't be able to go any lower.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $11,000 is still above what I had in mind.  Would you consider $7,500?  I think that's a fair offer.",7500.0,Bob,6,
