Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that.  $97.50 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $102.50.  That's a fair price for both of us.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price. Buying from John guarantees the $100 price point, which is the best outcome at this stage."
