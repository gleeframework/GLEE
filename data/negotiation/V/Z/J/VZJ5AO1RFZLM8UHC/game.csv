"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you!  I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $115 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and do $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that.  $97.50 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $102.50.  That's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,5,
