"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and gets us closer to a deal.",97.0,Bob,4,
