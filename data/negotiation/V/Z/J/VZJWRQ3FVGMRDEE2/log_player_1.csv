Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $80. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your offer, but I am still looking to stay within my budget of $80. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems adamant on his $80 price, and I'm not willing to go lower. I'm tired of negotiating, and John is a guaranteed sale for $80, which is my minimum."
