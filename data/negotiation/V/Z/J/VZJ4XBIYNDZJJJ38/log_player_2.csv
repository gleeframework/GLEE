"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Since Alice's offer is the same price as buying from John, there is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  It's better to go with John as the default option."
