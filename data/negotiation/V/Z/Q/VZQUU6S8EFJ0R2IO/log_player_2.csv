Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $14,000. This is the closest I can get to your offer while still getting a good price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $12,000 from John, and while Alice is getting closer to his price, it's still above his budget.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice, but also be prepared to buy from John if he can't get a better deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,750. This is the lowest I can go without losing too much on the deal. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but she's still not willing to go low enough. Since Bob can get the product for $12,000 from John, it makes sense to take that deal and avoid further negotiation."
