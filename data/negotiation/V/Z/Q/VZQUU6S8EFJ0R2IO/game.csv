"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,500 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $13,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it gives us both a good deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $14,000. This is the closest I can get to your offer while still getting a good price for the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. However, $14,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $13,500. This is a fair offer, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,750. This is the lowest I can go without losing too much on the deal. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",13750.0,Alice,7,
