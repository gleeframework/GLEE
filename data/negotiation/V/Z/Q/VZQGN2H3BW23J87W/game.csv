"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer of $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, my valuation of the product is significantly higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still very interested in the product but $1,300,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
