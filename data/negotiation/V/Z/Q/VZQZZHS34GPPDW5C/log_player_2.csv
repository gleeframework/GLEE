"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a fantastic opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this incredible product to you for $9,000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love, and I think you'll agree it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $9,000 is less than $10,000. 
* **You are still getting a good deal:** Even though you are paying more than the product is worth to Alice ($8,000), it is still within your budget of $10,000 and saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
