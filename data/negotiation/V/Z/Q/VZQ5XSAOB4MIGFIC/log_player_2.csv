"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, it's still more than Bob's ideal price point of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $850,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, aiming to get closer to his ideal price while showing Alice that he's serious about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is only $75,000 more than Bob's ideal price. Given the potential for continued negotiation, it's not worth risking a further counteroffer and possibly losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product while staying within a reasonable budget."
