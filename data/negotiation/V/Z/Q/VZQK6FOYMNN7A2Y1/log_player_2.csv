"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You're getting the product for $14,000 from Alice, which is less than John's price of $15,000.
* **It's within your budget.**  The price is below your maximum of $15,000.

While you could potentially try to negotiate further with Alice, accepting the offer is the most logical choice to save money in this situation."
