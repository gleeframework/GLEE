"Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for your business.  My starting price is $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing a fair price, but I need to ensure I receive at least a certain amount to make this worthwhile for me.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, my budget is a bit tighter than your initial offer. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,200,000 is unfortunately below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, given the value this product will bring.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of offering $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize we're getting closer, $1,250,000 is still slightly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,275,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value this product will bring to your business.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
