Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message focuses on the benefits for Bob, emphasizing a ""great deal"" and the product's value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for negotiation, inviting Bob to respond.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net. If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I can comfortably reject it and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm confident that's a price we can both be happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even my initial offer of $13,500.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  I believe there's room for negotiation. Bob has shown interest, and his counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay more than his initial stated value. 
* **Safe Backup:**  I can comfortably reject his offer knowing I have John as a buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price. 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I'm seeking.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my initial offer of $13,500 and Bob's counteroffer of $11,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate and reach a middle ground.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize that $12,000 is still a ""good deal"" for Bob, highlighting the value he'd be getting.
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is clear and concise, leaving no room for misunderstanding.
* **Open to Finalization:**  I reiterate my desire to ""make this work,"" indicating that I'm open to closing the deal if Bob agrees. 

This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise further and potentially close the deal at a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. How about we meet at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While he has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result. 
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** I have a secure buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price without further negotiation.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing out on other opportunities. 

Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price for my product, eliminating any further uncertainty."
