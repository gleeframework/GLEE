"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,250,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it. This reflects a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is a bit low for the value this product brings, I'm open to finding a compromise. Would you consider $1,950,000? It's a significant reduction on my initial ask and reflects my desire to see this deal through with you.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,950,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,650,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in this product and my desire to close this deal.  Let's find common ground.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving towards my position. To meet you halfway, how about we settle on $1,800,000? This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the true value of this product.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise. However, $1,800,000 is still above my maximum budget. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to pay $1,700,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
