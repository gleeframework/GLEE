"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold strategy, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his perceived value and can adjust my offer accordingly.  I'm keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I want to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price without risking losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $920,000 is a good price, and we're already four rounds into the negotiation. It's becoming increasingly likely that Bob will walk away if I continue to reject his offers, especially since I can always sell to John for $800,000. I'm taking the sure thing."
