"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, you can potentially get the product for less.  Since your maximum budget is $150, rejecting and making a counteroffer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, given that the product is worth $80 to Alice.  While I'm willing to pay more than that, I'm still aiming to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $110 is a good price. It's lower than her initial offer and still within my budget. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject my next counteroffer and I'd be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price without risking losing the deal."
