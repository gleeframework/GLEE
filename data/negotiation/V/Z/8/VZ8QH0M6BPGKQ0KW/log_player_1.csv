Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $600,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and your desire to sell. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product at that price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $725,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the progress we've made in negotiations. Let's reach an agreement that benefits us both.
