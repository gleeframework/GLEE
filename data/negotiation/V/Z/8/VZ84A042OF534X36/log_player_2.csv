Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $100.  It makes sense to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, $180 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm still willing to negotiate further to try and get a lower price, as I'm still within my 10 rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $125 is closer but still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay within my budget. How about we settle on $115? It's a fair price for both of us and lets us finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $125 was my previous offer, but I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous counteroffer, so I'll offer you $130. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $130. I've only got 3 rounds left, and I'm unlikely to get a better price from her. It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $100.  This ensures I get the product while staying within my budget."
