"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can go down to $950,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that price is still a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 725000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion.  I see where you're coming from, but that price doesn't reflect the value this product brings.  Let's settle at $875,000. This is a significant compromise and my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to come down below $875,000.  She's stated it's her final offer, and she's still significantly above your alternative purchase price from John. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, saving you $75,000 and avoiding further negotiation."
