{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that's higher than your minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob, who values the product at $120. This gives room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer, while ensuring you maximize your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is at your minimum, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price than $100 if you counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $105? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe $100 is a fair price for the product. Could we meet at $102? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $2 less than your minimum. It's better to accept this offer than to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with the same price from John."
