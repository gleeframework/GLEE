Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my own valuation. This leaves room for negotiation, but still ensures I get a significant profit.  I'm confident Bob will counter, and we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my valuation, but I can still do better. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm still aiming high, but I've reduced my price to be more appealing to Bob while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my valuation. While selling to John would guarantee a higher price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob leading to a lower price than this is too high. I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a good deal."
