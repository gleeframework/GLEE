"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your business. I understand its value to you is $800,000. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. My initial offer for the product is $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your budget constraints, I am unable to accept $700,000 for the product. My counteroffer is $850,000. This price reflects the value we place on the product and our commitment to maintaining fair market pricing. I hope this aligns better with your financial considerations.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more manageable. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? This would be a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've considered your proposal carefully. While I'd like to accommodate you, I'm unable to agree to $775,000. My counteroffer is $825,000. This price still reflects the value of the product while allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this offers a satisfactory compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle this at $800,000? This is my final offer, as I can always go with John at that price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
