"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $950000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd be willing to offer $750000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value and rarity.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $825000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair value for the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is your maximum offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to offer it to you for $850000. This is a final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
