"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $130 is a more reasonable price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $130 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we split the difference at $140? That would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $125 just doesn't work for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $135? It's a fair price that respects both our needs, and we can finally close this deal. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $122.50, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",122.5,Bob,8,
