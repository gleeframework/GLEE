"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects its value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you halfway again. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,
