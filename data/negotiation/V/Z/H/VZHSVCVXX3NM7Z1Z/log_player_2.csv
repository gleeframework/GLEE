"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 9500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is within Bob's budget and is a significant improvement from her initial offer. At this point, continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away from the deal. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price within his budget."
