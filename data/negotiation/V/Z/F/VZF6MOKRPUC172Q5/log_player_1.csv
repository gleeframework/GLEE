Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I also have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price above Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to go lower, and since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'll sell to him and avoid any further negotiations with Bob."
