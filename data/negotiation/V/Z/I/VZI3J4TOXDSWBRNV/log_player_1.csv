Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Sweet Spot:** The ideal scenario is selling to Bob for a price between $800,001 and $999,999.

**The Offer Strategy**

You need to balance maximizing your profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:**  Begin with a price significantly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
2. **Build Value:**  Instead of just stating a price, highlight the product's benefits to justify the high initial offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Its value to the right buyer is immense, and I believe it can transform your operations. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,200,000. Let's discuss how this product can benefit you and potentially explore a mutually agreeable price."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** The $1,200,000 price anchors the negotiation high.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's unique benefits and potential return on investment, justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By stating ""explore a mutually agreeable price,"" you signal willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially lower your price. However, never go below your $1,000,000 safety net with John."
