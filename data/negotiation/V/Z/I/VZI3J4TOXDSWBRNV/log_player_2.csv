"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Its value to the right buyer is immense, and I believe it can transform your operations. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,200,000. Let's discuss how this product can benefit you and potentially explore a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering.  There's room for negotiation, but it's highly unlikely Alice will drop down to a price you find acceptable."
