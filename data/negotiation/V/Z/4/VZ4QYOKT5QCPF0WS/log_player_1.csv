Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This means any price above this makes the deal good for him. 
* **Your Advantage:** You have a backup offer, giving you a strong negotiating position.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. Since you know his valuation, there's room to negotiate within a range he'll find acceptable.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its value, I believe a price of $875,000 is fair. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your position as a valued potential buyer."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** The offered price is significantly higher than your minimum but still leaves Bob with a potential gain.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, framing the higher price as justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording suggests willingness to discuss the price further, allowing for some back-and-forth if Bob counters.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach.  You could:

* **Go even higher:**  You could start at $900,000 or higher, but be prepared to negotiate down.
* **Offer a more ""take it or leave it"" deal:** This carries more risk, but could lead to a quicker, more profitable sale. 

The key is to balance confidence with flexibility, aiming to secure the best possible price from Bob."
