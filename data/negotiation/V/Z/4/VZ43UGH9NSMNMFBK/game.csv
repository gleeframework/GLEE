"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would that be possible?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,000, so I can offer it to you for $8,750. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,5,
