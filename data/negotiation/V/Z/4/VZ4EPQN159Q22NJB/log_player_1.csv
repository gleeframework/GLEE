"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a price that's favorable to you.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility. If he's willing to pay close to this price, we know he's serious. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind we have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so we don't want to go too low too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his absolute bottom line as it's the maximum value he places on the product.  While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $10,000, we have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. We'll aim for a counteroffer that brings him closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to be flexible to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($10,000) and our initial asking price ($20,000). This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal fairness.
* **Our Bottom Line:**  Importantly, this counteroffer is at our absolute lowest acceptable price. We're secure knowing we can always sell to John for this amount.
* **Pressure:** By holding firm at our bottom line, we put a bit of pressure on Bob to consider if he's willing to lose the deal over a $5,000 difference."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. I'd like to propose a price of $12,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we'd ideally like to get the full $15,000, Bob's offer of $12,500 is a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** We're still making a $2,500 profit over our minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Every round we spend negotiating is a risk. Closing the deal now secures a good profit.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get us closer to $15,000. Bob might be very firm at this point. 

Taking the $12,500 now is a solid win in this negotiation."
