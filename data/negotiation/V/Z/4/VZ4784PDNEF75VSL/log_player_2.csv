"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is much too high. It's important to negotiate a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60."", 
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower counteroffer than your ideal price. This leaves room for bargaining and signals to Alice that her initial price is unrealistic.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is courteous but clearly states that $120 is unacceptable. 
* **Aiming for a Deal:** By suggesting $60, we're aiming for a price that saves us a significant amount but also gives Alice room to negotiate upwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $60 is quite low, I could be willing to come down to $100 for you. I'm confident it's a fair price for this item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a little, but $100 is still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** This counteroffer presents your maximum budget to Alice. It's unlikely you'll get a better deal than this without going over your limit.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  By suggesting  ""meeting in the middle,"" you're emphasizing a sense of fairness and compromise, which can help move the negotiation forward.
* **Clear Bottom Line:**  Offering $80 lets Alice know this is your final price point. If she rejects it, you're prepared to walk away and buy from John."
