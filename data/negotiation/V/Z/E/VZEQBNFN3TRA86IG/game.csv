"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm a bit on a tight budget, and I'd love to get a better deal on this.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $105?  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit and gives you a good deal on a valuable product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $100. That way, we can both come out happy.",100.0,Bob,4,
