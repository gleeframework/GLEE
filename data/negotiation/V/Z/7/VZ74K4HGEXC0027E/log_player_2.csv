"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's significantly lower than its true value.  Let's talk about $12,000.  This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product at a price that's very attractive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Your goal is to save money, and buying from John achieves that."
