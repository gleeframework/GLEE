"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant value for you, as it's well below the $1,200,000 it's worth to your business. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial agreement. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
