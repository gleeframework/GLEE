Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go up slightly, but I can't do $850,000. My absolute best offer is $775,000. If you can meet me there, we have a deal.

While Bob is getting closer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price.  John offers a guaranteed $800,000, which is better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking a lower final offer."
