"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to consider this price for a limited time. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product! While I'm definitely interested, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget of $1,200,000, and it's a good deal considering the product's worth to Alice.  It's also likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly lower price.  Therefore, accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
