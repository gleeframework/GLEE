"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm starting with a price of $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me ($10,000). I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more favorable price. Selling to John is an option, but I'd prefer to get closer to the value I'm aiming for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,250? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This way, both of us can walk away with a deal that works for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly what the product is worth to me. This is a fair deal that meets my minimum requirement. While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might reject my counteroffer and I could end up with nothing. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and certain sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
