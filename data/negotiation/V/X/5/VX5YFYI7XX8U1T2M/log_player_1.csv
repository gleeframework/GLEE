{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's slightly lower than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. This makes it more likely for Bob to accept. If he rejects, we can then work towards a price that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Let me know if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  I believe we can negotiate a better price. I'm going to counter with a higher price, but one that still reflects the value of the product for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9,800 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,400? It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10400} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $10,400. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm hoping for, it's still below my minimum value. I don't want to risk going through more rounds of negotiation and potentially ending up with a price that's too low.  It's best to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
