"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9500. I can do $10200, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,
