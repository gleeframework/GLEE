# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a counteroffer. I am willing to consider $900,000 for the product, which is still above your initial offer but below mine. I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I am prepared to reconsider at $890,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise while still allowing me to maintain a satisfactory profit margin. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000

This is a good deal for Bob. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or become less willing to compromise. At this point, it's better to secure the deal at a good price rather than risk getting a worse outcome."
