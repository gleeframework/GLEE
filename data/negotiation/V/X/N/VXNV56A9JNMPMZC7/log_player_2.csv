"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $9,500. This is a great deal for you, as you value it at $10,000. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at $8,000, but I'd rather work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $9,500, which is lower than your maximum willingness to pay ($10,000).  Therefore, accepting her offer is the best option, as it saves you $500 compared to buying from John."
