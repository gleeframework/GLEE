Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still likely settle above John's offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it for $1,000,000 immediately signals we're willing to accept the minimum, leaving potential profit on the table.

By offering the product at $1,400,000, we create a win-win scenario where Bob gets a good deal compared to his perceived value, and we maximize our profit significantly beyond John's offer."
