"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $170, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is way too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $130? It's still a great deal for a product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's do $125.  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is very slowly coming down in price.  It's unlikely she'll go below $120, so it's best to take the guaranteed deal from John now."
