"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique features and potential"" aims to justify the high starting price and appeal to Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Open Communication:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, we encourage him to engage in the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts our initial offer, we exceed our minimum acceptable price.
2. **Understand Bob's Position:** His response will provide valuable information about his willingness to pay.
3. **Control the Negotiation:** By starting high, we set the initial frame for the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his perceived value ($1,200,000), it's still below our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). We have room to negotiate further and try to close the gap.  Since we have the option to sell to John at any time, we don't need to rush into accepting an offer below our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to show flexibility. How about we settle at $1,800,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We've lowered our price from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm (for now):** This counteroffer is still significantly above Bob's offer and our minimum, giving us room to bargain further. 
* **Justify the Price:** We're reiterating our belief in the product's high value without directly dismissing Bob's perspective. 

By taking this approach, we aim to:

1. **Encourage Bob to Move:** The significant difference between our counteroffer and his might prompt him to raise his price.
2. **Maintain a Strong Position:**  We're not conceding too much too quickly.
3. **Keep the Negotiation Moving:**  We're actively working towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to be flexible, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,600,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above our guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). While we could try to push for more, there's a risk:

* **Bob Might Walk:** He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, but there's no guarantee he'll go higher. 
* **Time is a Factor:**  We have a limited number of rounds, and we don't want to risk reaching an impasse and missing out on both Bob and John.

Accepting the $1,600,000 secures a profit and avoids the potential downsides of continued negotiation."
