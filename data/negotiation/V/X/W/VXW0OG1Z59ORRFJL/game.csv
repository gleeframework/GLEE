"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to show flexibility. How about we settle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to be flexible, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,600,000. Can we meet at this price?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
