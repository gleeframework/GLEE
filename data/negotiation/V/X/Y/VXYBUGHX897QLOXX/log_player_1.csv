I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."

Bob is being stubborn and hasn't budged from his initial offer.  It's getting risky to keep negotiating with him. I'll counter again, but I'm getting ready to sell to John if this doesn't work."
