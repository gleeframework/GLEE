"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is better than John's, but you can potentially do better by negotiating with Alice. There's room to negotiate further, as Alice is willing to sell for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $8,500, which is halfway between my ideal price of $8,000 and Alice's offer of $9,000.  This is a reasonable starting point for negotiations, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still better than buying from John for $10,000. It's only $200 more than my counteroffer, so it's likely that further negotiation will not get me a significantly lower price. Accepting Alice's offer saves time and effort."
