{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $800,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer, but still leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, but I can likely still get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 830000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still below Alice's offer. This should keep the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $845,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $845,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down significantly from her original price. While I'd love to get it lower, the risk of going another round and potentially losing the deal isn't worth it. $845,000 is a good price and within my budget."
