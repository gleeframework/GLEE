"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  $900,000 is a decent price, but we have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $750000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$750,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay.  I think we can still get a better deal. Let's see if I can get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $750,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $675,000?  This seems like a fair price considering the potential value of this product."", ""product_price"": 675000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $675000 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $725000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my target price, and I'm not sure I can push her any lower. This is a decent deal considering the potential value of the product and the fact that I can always buy from John as a backup."
