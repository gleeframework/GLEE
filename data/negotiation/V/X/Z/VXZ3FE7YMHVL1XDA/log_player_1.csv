"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This way, I can see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about $125? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob. By lowering my price slightly, I show I'm open to negotiation, but I'm still aiming for a higher price than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think $125 is a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your persistence. How about $120?  It's a compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm offering $120 to Bob,  which is a compromise between his last offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows that I'm flexible, but I still want to get a fair price for the product."
