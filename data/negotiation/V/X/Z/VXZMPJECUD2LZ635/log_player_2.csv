"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think you'll find it's a fair and competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than you need to pay. You know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $200,000 and achieve your goal."
