"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
