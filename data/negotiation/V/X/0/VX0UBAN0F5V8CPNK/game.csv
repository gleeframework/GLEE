"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  Let's compromise at $9,500. This way, we both get a good deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure I can go as high as $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? That's the best I can do.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I respect that.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $9,400.  That's a good deal for both of us.",9400.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we meet at $9,200? That's the lowest I can go.",9200.0,Bob,6,
