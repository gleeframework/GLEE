Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  Let's compromise at $9,500. This way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's getting close to the halfway point of the negotiations, and Bob is not budging much.  I'm better off guaranteeing the $12,000 from John."
