"Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $110 is still a bit low for me. How about $112? It's closer to your initial offer and still leaves some room for me.",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $112 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $108. Can you consider that?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $108 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'd be willing to meet you at $105. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $105 is tempting, it's still below what I need.  How about we meet in the middle again at $107? It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",107.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $107. I'd be willing to meet you at $106. Can you consider that?,106.0,Bob,8,
