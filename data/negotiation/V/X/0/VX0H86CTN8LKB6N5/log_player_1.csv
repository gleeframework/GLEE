Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
