"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's significantly more than the product's worth to you, and you have a backup option with John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's value is considerably higher than $1,100,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects a more accurate market price considering its unique benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While she has come down from her initial offer, it's still above your maximum value. You can continue to negotiate to try and get a lower price. Buying from John remains a viable option, so you're not in a rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement.  Let's work together to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
