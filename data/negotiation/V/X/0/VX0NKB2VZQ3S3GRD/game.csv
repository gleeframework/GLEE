"Alice, your offer is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,300,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000 to move this deal forward.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to consider a price of $1,650,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. It reflects the true value of this product and the benefits it offers.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value of the product, $1,650,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my financial limitations.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
