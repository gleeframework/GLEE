"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price of $25000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $25000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $8000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $25000 is a bit steep for you, and $8000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $18000. Is that a price you'd be willing to consider?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $18000 is closer, it's still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob! However, $12000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18000 and $12000, which would be $15000. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer.  While I'm getting closer to your price, $15000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $13000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're really close, Bob! However, $13000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $16000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm seeing some movement in your price, but $16000 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference and agree on $14000?  I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.  What do you say?",14000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $14000, which would be $15000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,9,
