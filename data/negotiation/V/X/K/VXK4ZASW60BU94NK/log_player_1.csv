{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $11,000. I believe it represents a great value and I'm hoping we can close the deal quickly. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price slightly below your minimum ($12,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob.  $11,000 is a significant markup from his perceived value ($8,000) but might be tempting if he needs the product. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This initial offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing the final price. Even if he negotiates down slightly, you'll still earn more than selling to John."
