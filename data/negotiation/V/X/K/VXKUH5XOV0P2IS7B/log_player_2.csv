Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further and sell the product to you for $85. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $85, and your goal is to get the product for the best possible price. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which is better than Alice's current offer."
