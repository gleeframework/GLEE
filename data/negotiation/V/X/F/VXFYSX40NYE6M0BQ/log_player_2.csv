"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value:** $1,100,000 is more than $800,000, indicating there is room for negotiation.
* **You can do better:** You have a fallback option with John at $1,200,000. This gives you leverage to negotiate a lower price with Alice. 

**Next Steps:**  You should make a counteroffer to Alice.  Start by aiming for a price closer to her perceived value, but leave some room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given its potential, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  I believe this reflects a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  The offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showing that you're serious about negotiating. It also leaves some room for compromise.
* **Focus on shared benefit:** The message emphasizes that the price is fair for both parties, which can help build trust and encourage further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Alice's response:**  Alice will either accept your counteroffer or make a new counteroffer. Be prepared to continue negotiating if necessary.
* **Keep John in mind:**  Remember that you have the option to purchase from John for $1,200,000. This gives you a safety net and helps you stay firm in negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This adjustment still reflects the true value of the [product name] and the significant return on investment it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above Alice's value:** Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still higher than her perceived value of $800,000. This suggests there's still room for negotiation.
* **Close to your target:** The price is getting closer to your desired range, but you can likely still secure a better deal.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You have a fallback option with John, which gives you leverage to push for a lower price.

**Next Steps:** 

* **Counteroffer again:** You should make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $950,000. This will show Alice that you're serious about finding a mutually beneficial price.
* **Be prepared to negotiate:** Alice might make another counteroffer. Be ready to continue negotiating until you reach an acceptable price or decide to buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,025,000 is still slightly out of my budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** This offer is a moderate increase from your previous counteroffer, showing flexibility but also staying firm in your desired price range. 
* **Focus on Compromise:**  The message emphasizes a desire for a mutually beneficial solution, encouraging Alice to meet you in the middle.
* **Staying Above Alice's Value:**  $975,000 is still comfortably above Alice's perceived value of $800,000, suggesting that the deal is potentially advantageous for her as well.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Alice's Response:** Alice may accept this offer, counter with a new price, or reject your proposal. Be prepared for any outcome.
* **Consider John's Offer:**  Keep in mind that you can always purchase from John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
