Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to her product's value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Alice knows John will buy the product for $12,000 if Bob refuses, so she doesn't need to go below that price.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price slightly below Alice's value leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still ensuring a significant profit.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price of $11,999 appears more appealing and ""negotiable"" than a round number like $12,000.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while having the security of John's offer as a backup."
