Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too much for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $105. If you're not willing to go lower, I'm going to have to buy from John instead.

Bob is holding firm at $105 and even threatening to go with another seller (though we know he's bluffing). It's unlikely he'll go higher.  It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than to potentially waste more time negotiating with Bob."
