"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll be very happy with your purchase.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $6,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll be happy with the compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch higher than I can comfortably do right now. How about we settle at $7,500? That would work well for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering your offer, I'm willing to reduce the price to $8,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8250.0,Alice,5,
