"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, the $1,000,000 price point is outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as I believe it still represents a good value for both of us. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $875,000. This would allow us both to secure a good deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I value closing this deal with you. Let's make it happen at $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
