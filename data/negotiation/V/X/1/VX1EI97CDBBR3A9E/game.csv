"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth $12,000 to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $7,000 is the highest I can go. Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the idea of splitting the difference, Bob, but I'm still a bit short on the value I'm looking for. I can offer you the product for $8,250. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done.",8250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer. I can do $7,750, and I think that's more than fair.  If you can't do that, I'll have to go with John.",7750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that this is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still a bit short on the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, but no lower. This is the best I can do.",8000.0,Alice,9,
