Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Knowing its value to someone of your discerning taste, I'm confident you'll recognize this is a rare opportunity. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 allows for some potential back-and-forth while still staying well above our minimum.
* **Create Urgency:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""rare opportunity"" subtly pressure Bob to act quickly.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  We know we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. If we knew more about Bob's negotiation style or the specifics of the product, we could tailor the message even further."
