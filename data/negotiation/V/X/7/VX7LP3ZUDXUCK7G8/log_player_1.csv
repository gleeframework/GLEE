Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $11,000, which is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel valued and open to negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This offer provides space for Bob to counter, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as a backup:** I have John as a backup option, ensuring I can still get my minimum value if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate with Bob. I can counter with a higher price and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **John is a strong backup:** I'm confident in selling to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $10,500 is a compromise, significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my original price.
* **Highlight the value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of its worth.
* **Open to compromise:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Avoid getting too close to my minimum:** $10,500 keeps a bit of buffer between my minimum price and my offer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product holds value for you, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **Potential for a quick deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer avoids further back-and-forth negotiations, saving time and energy.
* **No guarantee of a better offer:** There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob in the next round, and I risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **John is always an option:**  If I really need to sell for $12,000, I can always go to John as a last resort.

While $10,250 isn't ideal, it's a good compromise that allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid the potential for a breakdown in negotiations."
