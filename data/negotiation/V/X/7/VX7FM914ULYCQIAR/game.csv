"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, but $125 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I like that. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, but I'm still a bit above $112.50. How about we try $117.50? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the quality of the product.",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $117.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference again and settle on $115.  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $115, but I need to make a bit more on this sale. How about we try $118? It's just a small bump, but it's worth it to me.",118.0,Alice,7,
