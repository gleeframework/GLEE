"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $750,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also giving you a good deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while still fitting within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
