Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate further."

While not ideal, $160 is still a profit over selling to John. It's time to close the deal."
