Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price around $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price, and I have several rounds left to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This offer is still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,125,000. Would you consider $1,112,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,112,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my target, I believe I can still get a better price. We've only had four rounds, and I have a lot more time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. But I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,118,750? This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it brings us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1118750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,112,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $1,115,375. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,115,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,115,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,115,375 is very close to my goal. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of him backing out or reaching the 10-round limit is too high. Accepting his offer guarantees me a good profit and a successful deal."
