"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its true value to you. Let's get this deal finalized.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price around $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This offer is still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,125,000. Would you consider $1,112,500?",1112500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. But I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,118,750? This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it brings us closer to a deal. What do you say?",1118750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,112,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $1,115,375. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can consider it.",1115375.0,Bob,6,
