Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** While you could aim higher (closer to $120), there's a risk Bob might reject the offer. This price balances maximizing profit with the certainty of selling the product for at least $80."
