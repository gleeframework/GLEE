"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique quality of the product, $200 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $120 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the quality and uniqueness of the item.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $130. I think the product's unique features and quality are worth the extra $35. Let's meet in the middle at $112.50?",112.5,Alice,5,
