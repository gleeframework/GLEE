Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident it can generate significant returns for your business.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the product's unique value and my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

$1,800,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the potential of the product while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
