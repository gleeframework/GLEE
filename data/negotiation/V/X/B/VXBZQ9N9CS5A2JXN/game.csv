"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $14,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I have to make a living, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we say $16,500? That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However,  $16,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $15,500? That would be a great price for me and still a decent deal for you. ",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price, considering the value this product will bring to you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
