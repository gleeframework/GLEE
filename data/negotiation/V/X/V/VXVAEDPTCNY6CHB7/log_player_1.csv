{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the price negotiations seem to be getting stuck.  Bob is only willing to go up a small amount, and I'm not willing to drop much further.  To avoid the risk of getting stuck in a loop and losing valuable time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's not the ideal price, but it's still a good deal for me and guarantees a sale."
