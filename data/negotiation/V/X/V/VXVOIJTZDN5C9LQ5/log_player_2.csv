Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, however, and I'm prepared to offer a lower price.  How about $1400000? This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, but $900000 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, though. How about $1150000? It's a significant reduction from my previous offer and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.
