"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a very reasonable price.  Considering its value and potential, I believe $1800000 is a fair starting point. Let's discuss.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, however, and I'm prepared to offer a lower price.  How about $1400000? This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our interests.  Let's work together to make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, but $900000 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, though. How about $1150000? It's a significant reduction from my previous offer and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1150000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $950000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to walk away if it's not acceptable.",950000.0,Bob,6,
