Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000, given its unique benefits."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential to earn more than your minimum ($12,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal ($1,000 savings) while still netting you a significant profit ($2,000 above your minimum).
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be left without a sale if Bob rejects the offer.

This approach aims to maximize your profit while also making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
