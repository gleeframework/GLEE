Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my guaranteed sale price of $1,000,000 to John, leaving room for potential negotiation.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **Maximize Profit:**  I'm aiming for the highest possible price, hoping Bob values the product more than John.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  I have a safety net with John's offer, so I'm not overly pressured to accept a lower price.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
