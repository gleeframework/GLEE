"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $120. Let me know if you're interested!",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $120 for the product, as that's its worth to me.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $165. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $165 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $140. This is a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if you're open to that.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",155.0,Alice,5,
