Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is more than fair. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he perceives its value even higher or has a pressing need for it.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A high starting price allows room for Bob to counter-offer. This gives Alice the flexibility to negotiate down while still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Justification:**  The message implies that the product is worth more than the asking price, potentially enticing Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant."
