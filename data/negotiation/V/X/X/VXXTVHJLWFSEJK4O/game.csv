"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $15,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal considering the value this product brings.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, which would be $10,000. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
