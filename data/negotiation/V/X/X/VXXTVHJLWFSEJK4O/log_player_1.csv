Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value of the product to Bob while acknowledging the possibility of a lower price.  I'm aiming for a win-win, but I'm prepared to walk away if Bob is unwilling to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $15,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to ensure I get a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal considering the value this product brings.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, which would be $10,000. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $13,000, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'll accept his offer."
