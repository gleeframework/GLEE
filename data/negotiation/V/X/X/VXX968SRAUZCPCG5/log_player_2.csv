"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150, it's still a bit high. There's room for negotiation, and you're aiming to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to do $100?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $110 is a good compromise. It's still within your budget and significantly lower than her initial asking price.  While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars by continuing to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay $150 to John outweighs the potential savings."
