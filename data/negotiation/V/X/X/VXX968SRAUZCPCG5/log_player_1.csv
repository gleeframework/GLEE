Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone in my message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** While I don't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, I'm hinting at it by saying ""I think you'd be really interested in it."" This subtly reinforces the product's desirability. 

This approach balances the need to maximize my profit with the need to keep Bob interested in the negotiation.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to do $100?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $100 is still below my desired profit margin.
* **Counteroffer Potential:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:** While John offers a guaranteed $80, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and show that I'm willing to fight for a better deal. I'll use my next counteroffer to try and bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering a price of $110, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $100.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone, using phrases like ""I appreciate your offer"" and ""I'm sure you'll be very happy with the product."" This keeps the negotiation amicable and encourages Bob to consider my offer.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and make him feel like he's getting a good deal. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between being firm in my price expectations and maintaining a constructive dialogue with Bob.  Let's see if this gets us closer to an agreement!"
