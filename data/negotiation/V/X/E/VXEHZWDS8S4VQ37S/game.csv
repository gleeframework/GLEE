"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a truly valuable asset, and I believe it has the potential to be very beneficial for your company. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  My initial offer is $1200000. Let's discuss further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that amount.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not able to go as low as $900000.  This product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it will generate a lot of value for your company.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. My counteroffer is $1050000.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so my counteroffer is $975000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975000 is still significantly lower than the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and offer $1012500. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. Let's work towards a final agreement.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise one more time, so my counteroffer is $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but I need to stay within my limits.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle once more. I'm offering $987500 as a final compromise. It's a fair price that allows you to acquire a valuable asset while still ensuring I receive a decent return on my investment. Let's finalize this deal.",987500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial agreement. My counteroffer is $920000.
