Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to start with my maximum price point, as I know this is the most I'm willing to pay. Hopefully Alice is willing to come down a bit, but if not, I can always buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price.  While I'm close to reaching a deal, it's starting to feel like we're in a stalemate. Since I have a reliable alternative with John, I'm going to cut my losses and buy from him."
