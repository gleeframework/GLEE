"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm confident that this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring this product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm counteroffering at $1,012,500. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's value to you.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
