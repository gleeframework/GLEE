"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12000. I believe it's a great value for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is higher than Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer that's still within his budget. This counteroffer shows he's serious about buying the product but wants to save as much money as possible.  The message is polite but firm, setting the stage for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $10500 to make this deal work. This is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  However, it's closer than her previous offer, so Bob can try to negotiate a lower price again. There are still rounds remaining, so Bob can continue to try to find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $10,000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. He's now offering Alice his maximum price, making it clear that this is his final offer. By emphasizing ""compromise,"" he's trying to appeal to Alice's desire to close the deal."
