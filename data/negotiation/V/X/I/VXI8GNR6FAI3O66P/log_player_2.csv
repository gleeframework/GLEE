# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to pursue. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still too high.  While it's better than John's offer, there's room for negotiation to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,350,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, I can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There's room for both of us to compromise a bit more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,350,000, but I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,325,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $1,320,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,320,000, which is very close to my counteroffer of $1,325,000.  It's worth accepting this offer to secure the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer.  The potential savings outweigh the small difference between our final offers."
