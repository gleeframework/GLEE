Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still higher than what the product is worth to Bob.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win for both of us.  I'm highlighting the value he's getting at this price, and I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging. 

**Strategy:**

By starting at $12,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation. This is a good tactic because it allows for potential counteroffers from Bob. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to counter with a slightly lower price, but always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 

If the negotiations with Bob go nowhere, I can always sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring I get my minimum desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting his offer would mean losing out on a significant amount of potential profit. I believe I can still get a better price through further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired price.  By strategically lowering my price in small increments, I aim to reach a compromise that is mutually beneficial,  while still ensuring I earn a decent profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go down to $11,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $11,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer of $12,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about reaching a deal and willing to compromise. 
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, emphasizing the fairness of the offer and the shared value we both place on the product. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move.  By dropping my price slightly, I'm showing Bob that I'm flexible. This could lead to him accepting my counteroffer or making a counteroffer closer to my desired price.  

If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I'll continue to negotiate in small increments, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and the possibility of selling to John if negotiations become unproductive."
