Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $100 as possible, knowing Bob values the product less. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Time Value:** While we have a guaranteed $100 from John, selling quickly to Bob might be slightly more advantageous even at a slightly lower price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. There's always a chance Bob might accept $95 outright, or he might try to negotiate further."
