"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $800,000 to you. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $900,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price close to my desired value. I'm also framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to meet you halfway. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $775,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, $775,000 is still below my minimum. I'll reject this offer and counter again in the next round. There's still time to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a middle ground. Let's try $825,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower, to $795,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not ready to sell for less than $800,000 yet.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $795,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $810,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 810000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $810,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $797,500. I'm getting close to my limit, but I really like the product and want to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $797,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $797,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the point where I'm not confident I can get Bob to offer my minimum price of $800,000.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price, I'll sell the product to John for $800,000. It's a guaranteed deal and secures my desired value."
