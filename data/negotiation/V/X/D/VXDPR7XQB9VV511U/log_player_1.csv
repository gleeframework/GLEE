""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value at this price, and I'm confident it will be beneficial for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to earn as much as possible.  While we have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer. Even if he negotiates down slightly, we'll still likely get more than $15,000.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $14,000 seems more appealing and ""negotiable"" than a round number like $15,000. 

**Important Considerations:**

* We don't know how much Bob is *willing* to pay, only the product's value to him ($12,000). Our offer needs to be enticing while staying above our minimum.
* Time isn't a factor in this scenario. If it were, we might adjust our strategy to secure a faster sale."
