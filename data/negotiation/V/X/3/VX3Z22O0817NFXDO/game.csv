"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $9,800? It's a good compromise between our previous offers, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",9800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  I'm willing to move a bit on my price. Would you consider $9,300? I think that's a very fair offer.",9300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $9,300 yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $9,550? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for the product.",9550.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I can do $9,400, but that's really the best I can offer.  What do you say?",9400.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,400 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $9,450? It's a small adjustment, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9450.0,Alice,9,
