Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into it.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $9,800? It's a good compromise between our previous offers, and I think it's a fair price for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $9,300 yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $9,550? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,550.

Round 8

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,400 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $9,450? It's a small adjustment, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,450. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,450
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $9,450.  It's unlikely we'll get a better deal from her with only one round left.  It's time to cut our losses and go with John's guaranteed $10,000 price."
