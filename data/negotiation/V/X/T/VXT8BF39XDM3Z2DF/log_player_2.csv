**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that she's unwilling to meet a price point that works for you. She's dropped her price, but not enough to justify continuing the negotiation.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000, which is your maximum budget. It's time to cut your losses with Alice and take the sure thing."
