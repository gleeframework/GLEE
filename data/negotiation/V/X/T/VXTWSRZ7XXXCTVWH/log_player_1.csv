Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:** I'm starting high, at $175, to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly and inviting tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Asking for his opinion:** I'm inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation process and make him feel heard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I can potentially get more by continuing the negotiation. Since I have 10 rounds, I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you're interested.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  How about $165? It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 165}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering with $165, which is a compromise between my original offer and Bob's offer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm giving Bob a reason to accept by emphasizing the fairness of the price and highlighting the win-win aspect of the deal.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, and I'd like to propose $150 as the final price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has remained firm at $150.  Since this is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of rounds, it's best to accept and close the deal.  There's no guarantee I can get more in the remaining rounds, and selling to John would result in the same price."
