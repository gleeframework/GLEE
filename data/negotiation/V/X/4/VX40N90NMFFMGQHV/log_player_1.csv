{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $200, which is higher than my minimum of $150. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a better chance of getting a higher price.
* **Positive and engaging message:** I'm using a friendly and inviting tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Asking for feedback:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm opening the door for a conversation and potentially understanding Bob's perspective on the value of the product. 

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while remaining open to a fair negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking of making an offer of $150. Would you be willing to consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $150 meets my minimum requirement, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to find a compromise that's more beneficial for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $175? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:**  I'm showing Bob that I've heard his offer and am willing to negotiate.
* **Counter-offering with a reason:** I'm not just throwing out a random number. I'm giving a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Staying firm but flexible:**  $175 is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but also maintaining a price that's closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $175. How about $162.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $162.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $162.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $162.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price of $200, it's important to consider the following:

* **Time:** Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and ultimately result in me selling to John for $150 anyway.
* **Risk:** There's no guarantee that Bob will come up in his next offer. If I reject him, I risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** While $162.50 is not ideal, it's a good starting point for a potential future sale. Perhaps if I build a positive relationship with Bob, he'll be more willing to pay closer to my desired price in the future.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer at $162.50 is the most logical decision. It secures a sale at a price that's slightly above my minimum, allowing me to move on to other opportunities."
