Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is offering $145, which is closer to my minimum price of $150 and I only have 6 rounds left. It's better to accept now than risk losing him and having to sell to John for the minimum."
