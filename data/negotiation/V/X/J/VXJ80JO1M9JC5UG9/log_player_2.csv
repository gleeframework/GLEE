# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $200.  What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still asking $175.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $175 is closer to your budget, it's still over your $100 limit.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further.  You'll lose nothing by rejecting and trying again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you being willing to come down, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $150.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 150}
