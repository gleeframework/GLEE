Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $8,000, so starting at $10,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, he has incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** Bob knows exactly what you're offering. 

Remember, you can always adjust this offer based on Bob's response and your own negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. Would you be willing to consider $8,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $8,000, you can likely do better. It's worth pushing for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This would still be a great value for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9250}
``` 

Here's why this counteroffer is a good strategy:

* **It's a compromise:** You're moving closer to Bob's offer, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  $9,250 is still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **It's a reasonable counter:** It's halfway between your original offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's only slightly lower than your counteroffer of $9,250 and it's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's a good deal for both parties, and it avoids the risk of losing the sale to John."
