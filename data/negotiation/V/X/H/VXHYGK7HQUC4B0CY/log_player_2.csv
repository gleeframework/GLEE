"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. You are willing to pay a maximum of $80, and her offer is $40 more than that. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
