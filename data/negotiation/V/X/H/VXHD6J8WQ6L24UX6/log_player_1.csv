Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it still leaves me with a profit and is likely to be attractive to Bob given the product's value to him. 

This strategy allows for potential negotiation and a chance to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter with a new price.  I will always have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 if I don't reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want to earn.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price. I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob, but I am also prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my minimum.  This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate, while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum that it's worth closing the deal and avoiding the risk of further negotiation or a potential stalemate.  It's also a good result considering Bob's initial offer."
