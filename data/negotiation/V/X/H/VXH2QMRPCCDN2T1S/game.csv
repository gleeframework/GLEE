"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9000 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $8500?  That's a fair middle ground, and it would allow us to close the deal. ",8500.0,Bob,4,
