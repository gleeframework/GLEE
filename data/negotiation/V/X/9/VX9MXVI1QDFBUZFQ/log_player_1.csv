Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price and what I value the product at. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the product's true value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

While Bob is moving closer to my range, I believe there's still room for negotiation. We are still in the early rounds, and I'm willing to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. Let's make this deal happen. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair and reasonable price for this valuable product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,280,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to budge, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob's final offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, and his ultimatum suggests he's serious about walking away. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer."
