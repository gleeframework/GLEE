"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it.  $170 is a bit steep for me though.  I'm willing to pay $130 for it.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $170 is a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $142.50?  That seems fair to both of us.",142.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand that $142.50 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $147? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really like the product.",147.0,Alice,5,
