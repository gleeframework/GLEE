"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is quite high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While your price is still lower than I'm comfortable with,  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. To be honest,  $1,000,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider something closer to $750,000? That would make things much easier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
