# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get a bit more for it. I'm thinking of a price of $1,150,000. What do you think?

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,150,000 is a lower price than before, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price and leaves room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but I need to get a bit closer to the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob should accept the offer. While it's still higher than his ideal price, it's a fair compromise. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings."
