"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value and my budget.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $5,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $6,500? I believe this is a fair compromise.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $8,200. It's still a good deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
