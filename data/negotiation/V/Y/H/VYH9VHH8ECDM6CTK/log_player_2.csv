Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $8,200. It's still a good deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200.

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $8,000. It makes more sense to buy from John at the fixed $8,000 price and avoid further negotiation."
