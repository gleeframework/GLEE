"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to recover some of my investment.",8250.0,Alice,3,
