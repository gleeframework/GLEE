"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, signaling that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $15000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more. I'm not in a rush to sell and have time to explore other options.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's initial offer shows him that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Potential for a Higher Price:** By continuing the conversation, I might be able to secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This still represents a significant value for you, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $15,000 to $12,500.
* **Fair Offer:** $12,500 is a reasonable compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.
* **Value Highlight:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him that it's worth more than $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $12500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $11500. This is my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and it's likely that I won't get a better price.
* **Time Constraint:**  I'm already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a deal with John at $10,000.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the potential benefit of continued negotiation is not worth the risk of losing this deal."
