"I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $14,000 for the product. I think it's a bit pricey, but I'm interested in making a deal. Can you meet me halfway?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about $16,000?  That's still a significant savings for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let's find a compromise!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $16,000. How about $15,200? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",15200.0,Bob,4,
