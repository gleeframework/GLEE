"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially save more money by counter-offering.  There's a significant difference between Alice's value ($800,000) and her offer ($1,000,000), indicating room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a good deal for both of us, and it gives me a little room to negotiate further. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than Bob's initial limit of $1,200,000 and also higher than Bob's last counter-offer of $900,000.  Accepting this offer ensures a deal and saves a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
