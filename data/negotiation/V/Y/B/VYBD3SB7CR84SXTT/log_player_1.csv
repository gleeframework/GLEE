{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob is likely to counter, as the product is worth more to him.  I'll be ready to respond to his counteroffer and try to find a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit low considering the product's value to him. I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a good deal for both of us, and it gives me a little room to negotiate further. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
