"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for it. Can you meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $110?  It's still a great deal for you and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a fair profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to make a decision at that price.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $105 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  It's a fair price for both of us and I think it's a deal we can both be happy with.  Let's make this happen!",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable going above $105. I think that's the best price I can offer. I'm willing to make a decision at that price, so I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $105.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on $105.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time.  Let's settle on $106.25.  It's a fair compromise and I believe it's a deal we can both agree on.  Let's close this out!",106.25,Alice,7,
