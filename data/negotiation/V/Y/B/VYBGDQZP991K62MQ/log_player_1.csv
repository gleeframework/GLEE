Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for it. Can you meet me at that price?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $105 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?
