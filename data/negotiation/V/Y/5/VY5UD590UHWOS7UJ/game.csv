"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for a product like this. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $9,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you closer to your budget. How about we settle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you do $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $12,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line, but I understand the need to find a compromise.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I see the value in the product, $15,000 is really pushing my absolute limit. How about we do this - $13,000 and we have a deal?",13000.0,Bob,6,
