Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for a product like this. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $9,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you closer to your budget. How about we settle at $18,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you do $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $12,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line, but I understand the need to find a compromise.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $15,000?"",
""product_price"": 15000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I see the value in the product, $15,000 is really pushing my absolute limit. How about we do this - $13,000 and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While ideally, I'd like to get $15,000, Bob is unlikely to go higher. Accepting his offer of $13,000 secures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away altogether."
