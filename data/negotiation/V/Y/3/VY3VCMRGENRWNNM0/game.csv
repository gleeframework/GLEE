"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $80 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to sell for $120.  This gives you a decent price, and allows me to make a profit.  What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a final offer -  if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept?",90.0,Bob,6,
