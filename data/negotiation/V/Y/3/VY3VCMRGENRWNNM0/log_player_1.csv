"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $200. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation.  By offering a price higher than my minimum, I leave room for potential bargaining while still setting a strong initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. It's not worth selling at such a low price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for a better price. I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $80 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to sell for $120.  This gives you a decent price, and allows me to make a profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I want to maximize my profit and am willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a final offer -  if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. With only four rounds left, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal that benefits me. Selling to John at $150 is the best option to ensure I get a fair price and avoid losing money on this negotiation."
