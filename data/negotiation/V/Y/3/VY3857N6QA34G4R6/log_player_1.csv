Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I explicitly state ""Let me know what you think!"" to show I'm open to discussion.

**Strategy:**

This approach allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I aim to get as close to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) as possible.
* **Avoid immediate rejection:**  Starting high but with room for negotiation makes Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will give me insight into his willingness to pay and help me adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain my leverage:**  Demonstrating my unwillingness to accept a low price shows Bob that I'm serious about my value.
* **Explore further negotiation:**  I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price and see if Bob is willing to compromise.
* **Avoid selling to John:**  I still want to maximize my profit and see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This reflects the value you'll get from it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $12,000 to $10,000, but still remaining above Bob's initial offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value Bob will get from the product to justify the price.
* **Open to Agreement:**  I use the phrase ""Let's see if we can find common ground"" to encourage further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a reasonable price:**  $10,000 is still significantly above Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value.
* **Test Bob's willingness to compromise:**  His response will reveal if he's truly interested in the product and willing to pay more.
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  By remaining open to discussion, I can potentially secure a more favorable deal."
