"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's desired price of $10,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the competitive price, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, and the counteroffer of $10,500 is a good starting point.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10900. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $11150. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,150 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While there's still room for negotiation, Bob has already gone through several rounds and may be running out of time to reach a deal with Alice. To avoid further negotiation and ensure he gets the product within his budget, Bob should choose to buy from John at $10,000. This guarantees him the product at his desired price, even if it means missing out on potentially finding a lower price with Alice."
