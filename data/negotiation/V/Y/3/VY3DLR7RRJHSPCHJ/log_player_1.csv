{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is certainly impressive, but $1,450,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is a significant jump down. While it's tempting to take such a large sum, there's still room for negotiation.  We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

We're holding firm close to our desired price, but adding a touch of finality to encourage Bob to act quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to maximize your profit, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly very interested and is making reasonable increases to his offers. Accepting $1,375,000 is a strong profit and avoids the risk of him dropping out in later rounds."
