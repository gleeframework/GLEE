"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I know you're interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is lower than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her offer is quite close to your fallback option (buying from John)."
