"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is an amazing deal! Alice is offering the product for significantly less than it's worth to me and even less than my fallback option with John. There's no need to negotiate further."
