Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you value, for $14,500. It's a fantastic deal for something you'll gain significant value from."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,500 leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **High Enough Above My Minimum:** This price is significantly higher than my $10,000 minimum, ensuring a substantial profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum."
