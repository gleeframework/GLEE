"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This extraordinary item holds immense value to me, but I understand its true worth to you might be even greater. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I am extending an offer to sell it to you at a special price of $950,000. This represents a significant saving compared to its market value, making it an attractive proposition for someone as discerning as yourself. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if there's anything else I can provide to help you make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's higher than what John is offering. You can save $250,000 by going with John.  There's no need to negotiate with Alice further since you already have a better alternative."
