"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My price is $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a positive tone and shows you're willing to work with him.  I'm aiming to maximize my profits while leaving a bit of wiggle room for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a great product, and I think you'll be happy with it at this price.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $85. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a bit more. I believe I can still negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $85 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go back to $90. I'm still thinking $85 is a fair price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's counteroffer is too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell below my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's better for me to sell to John for a guaranteed profit than to risk losing out on a better deal."
