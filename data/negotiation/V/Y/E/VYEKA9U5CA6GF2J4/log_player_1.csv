Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175** is a starting point that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message** is friendly and engaging, aiming to build a positive rapport. 
* By starting high, I can potentially secure a higher price. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer down slightly, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept such a low price.
*  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm counteroffering at $140, which is still above my minimum but shows a willingness to compromise.
* The message is friendly and reaffirms Bob's interest in the product.
* I'm highlighting the value of the product and framing the offer as a win-win for both of us.
* This counteroffer should hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I really think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* While I want to get the best price possible, I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum. 
* Selling to John for $150 ensures I get my minimum price and guarantees a sale. 
* It's better to sell to John and ensure I get a good price than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk ending up with a lower price or no sale at all."
