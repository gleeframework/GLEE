"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 might be a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can see that you're really interested in the product, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can offer you a compromise at $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really serious about getting this deal done. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,7,
