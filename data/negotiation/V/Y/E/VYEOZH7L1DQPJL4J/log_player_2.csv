Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm looking to find the right buyer. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is unfortunately a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd need to come in lower. I'm prepared to offer $750,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:** Starting at $750,000 is a bold move, but it shows Alice you're serious about negotiating.
* **Justification:** The message explains your reasoning for the lower offer, emphasizing your interest while highlighting the price discrepancy.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  $750,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your maximum budget, it's still above your desired price. It's worth seeing if you can further negotiate and potentially secure the product for closer to your target of $800,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $825,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price.  I'd like to offer $800,000, which is my final offer.  I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer clearly signals that $800,000 is your absolute limit.

* **Appeal to Common Ground:** By mentioning your ""final offer,"" you create a sense of urgency and put pressure on Alice to make a decision."
