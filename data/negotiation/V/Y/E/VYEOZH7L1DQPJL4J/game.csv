"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950000 is unfortunately a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd need to come in lower. I'm prepared to offer $750000. What are your thoughts?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $825000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price.  I'd like to offer $800000, which is my final offer.  I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
