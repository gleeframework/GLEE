Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to create a good rapport with Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering a price lower than my minimum, I'm showing flexibility and opening the door for counteroffers.

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of reaching a deal with Bob while also leaving options open if he rejects the offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $10,000 I'd be willing to accept.  
* **I have time to negotiate:** I have 8 rounds left, so I can continue to negotiate with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **John is always an option:** I know I can sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a deal below that.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is almost up:** We are down to two rounds left, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum.
* **Risk of going lower:** If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I risk not getting a better price and wasting valuable time.
* **John is the safer option:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $10,000.

With limited time remaining and the likelihood of a deal with Bob becoming less likely, I choose to sell the product to John for $10,000. This ensures I receive my desired value and avoids the risk of continuing a potentially unproductive negotiation."
