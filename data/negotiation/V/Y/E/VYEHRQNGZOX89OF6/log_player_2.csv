"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the offer of $14,000 is higher than Alice's valuation, it's still lower than your maximum budget of $15,000 and significantly lower than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
