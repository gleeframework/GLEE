Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly while still ensuring Alice a significant profit.
* **Create Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" Alice adds a touch of pressure for Bob to make a decision, increasing the chances of a sale.

**Important Note:**  It's a delicate balance. Offering it for too much less (e.g., $12,000) might make Bob suspicious or feel like he's getting a deal that's too good to be true."
