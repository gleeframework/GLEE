"Hey Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit too low for me right now, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105? Let's see if we can make this work.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $105 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $95?  I'm really hoping to close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still a bit above what I can do.  I'm willing to go up to $97, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",97.0,Bob,6,
