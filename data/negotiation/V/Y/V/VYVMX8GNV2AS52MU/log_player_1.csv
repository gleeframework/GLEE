"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $90.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to $100 if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $95. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $92. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $100, we're already in round 4 and there's a risk of further negotiation back and forth.  $92 is a good profit, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
