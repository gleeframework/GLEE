{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's also a bit above Bob's maximum budget, showing willingness to compromise while still trying to save as much as possible."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John at his maximum budget. Further negotiation with Alice carries the risk of losing the product altogether, especially if Alice's counteroffers continue to be above Bob's budget."
