"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** You're willing to pay up to $80, and Alice's offer is significantly lower. 
* **Negotiation:** There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price. 
* **Risk:**  While there's a chance Alice might not come down in price, you have 9 more rounds to try.  Buying from John immediately is not the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** You're aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and $40 is a substantial drop from $50.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Flexibility:** If she rejects, you can adjust your offer upwards in subsequent rounds, but still remain within your target price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** Alice's counteroffer is only $5 higher than your previous offer, which indicates she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:** You still have plenty of rounds to get a better price.  
* **John's Offer:**  While $55 is closer to your limit, you're not yet at a point where buying from John is the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:**  You're gradually increasing your offer to show Alice you're serious, but still holding firm to your price target. 
* **Testing Limits:** This offer tests whether Alice is closer to your target price or her original asking price.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** By incrementally increasing your offer, you increase the chances of Alice accepting it."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Increasing Offers:** Alice's offers are steadily increasing,  which means she's not ready to budge significantly.  However, you're still well within your price range.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50} 
```

* **Final Push:** With five rounds remaining, you need to start getting closer to a final deal. This offer signals your willingness to compromise. 
* **Balanced Approach:**  While John's offer is still an option, you're attempting to secure a slightly better price from Alice."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Increasing Offers:** Alice's offers are continuing to increase, but you still have time to try and get a better price.
* **Risk Assessment:** Accepting her offer would put you close to your limit, and there's still a chance to negotiate a better price.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is still an option, you're not yet at a point where it's the most attractive choice. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting, you can try to get Alice closer to your ideal price before having to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice's offer is getting closer to your price target. You're increasing your offer to show you're serious but also pushing for a better deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only three rounds left, you need to move closer to a final agreement to avoid buying from John.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** You've demonstrated willingness to compromise, but this offer signals that you're also not willing to settle for Alice's current price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** Alice's offer is getting dangerously close to your maximum price.  However, you still have one round left to try and negotiate a better price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While John's offer is a safe option, you're only $10 away from your target price.  
* **Final Push:** This is your last chance to try and get a better price from Alice. You can make one final counteroffer to see if she will come down."

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is your last chance to get a better deal from Alice.  Offering $60 represents a compromise, but also pushes Alice to make a decision.
* **Risk Assessment:** If Alice rejects, you'll have to buy from John at $80.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This offer is close enough to her last offer that she might be willing to accept it to close the deal.  It's a high-risk, high-reward move."
