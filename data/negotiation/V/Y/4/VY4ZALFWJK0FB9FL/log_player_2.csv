"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still some wiggle room. I'll try another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down to $750,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $800,000 is a significant savings compared to John's price. It's time to accept the deal."
