"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left, and Bob can always buy from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming to be significantly below Alice's initial price.  This shows he's serious about negotiating and hopes to get Alice to come down quickly.  He also leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging that a middle ground might be reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,200,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly what the product is worth to Bob. While he could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price.  He's also already lost a round, and with 7 rounds remaining, the risk of losing out on the deal is increasing.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most prudent move, as he saves money compared to buying from John."
