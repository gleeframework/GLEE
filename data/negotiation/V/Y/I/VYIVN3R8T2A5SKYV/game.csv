"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $8,000 to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and its value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a good compromise and allows us both to make a decent deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and our respective needs. Let's see if we can close the deal here.",9500.0,Bob,6,
