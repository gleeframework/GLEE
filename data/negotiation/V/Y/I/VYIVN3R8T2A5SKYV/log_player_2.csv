"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $8,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but it's too early to accept her offer.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $10,500 is still above my maximum budget. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a good compromise and allows us both to make a decent deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $10,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm starting to get nervous about running out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and our respective needs. Let's see if we can close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $9,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,750 is still higher than my target price, and we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I could continue to counteroffer, the risk of not reaching an agreement is increasing.  Given that John is willing to sell the product for my desired price of $8,000, it's more sensible to buy from him and secure the product at my desired price."
