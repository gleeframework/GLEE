"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the potential in your product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay at this time. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value for the product. I'll try to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is still out of my reach. I'm prepared to go up to $900000, which represents a significant increase from my initial offer. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it allows us both to make a reasonable deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still not enough.  Considering the unique value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
