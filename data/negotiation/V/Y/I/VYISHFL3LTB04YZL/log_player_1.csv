{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($800,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving us the chance to potentially settle somewhere between $1,100,000 and his maximum.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  We have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000, ensuring we don't lose money. This knowledge gives us leverage in negotiations with Bob."
