"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  Bob can potentially save money by negotiating with Alice.
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  Knowing John's price gives Bob a safety net if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we start at $12,000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** Bob starts with a lower offer than Alice's price, showing he's serious about negotiation, but it's still within the realm of reason.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** Bob mentions finding a price that works for *both* of them, creating a positive tone.
* **Sets the stage for counter-offers:**  By proposing $12,000, Bob expects Alice to counter and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above Bob's ideal price:**  $13,000 is still higher than what Bob wants to pay. 
* **More negotiation is possible:** Bob has the time and opportunity to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially get a lower price.
* **John's offer remains a backup:**  If the negotiation with Alice fails, Bob can still buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500. That's a fair price, considering the product's value to me, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** Bob is showing he's willing to compromise but not conceding too much.
* **Focus on fairness:**  Bob emphasizes the ""fair"" price, appealing to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Positive framing:**  Mentioning a deal that leaves both happy encourages a win-win mentality."
