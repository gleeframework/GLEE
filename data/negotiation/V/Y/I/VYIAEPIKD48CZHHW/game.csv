"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we start at $12,000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500. That's a fair price, considering the product's value to me, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,
