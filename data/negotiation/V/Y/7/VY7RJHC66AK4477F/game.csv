"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000 for it.  This reflects the fair market value based on my own research and budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
