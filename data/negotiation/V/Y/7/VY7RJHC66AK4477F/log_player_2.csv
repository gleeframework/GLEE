I hope this aligns more closely with what you're looking for, and we can move forward towards a successful transaction.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still slightly above Bob's budget.  He's already made a counteroffer and is closer to his desired price.  There's potential to negotiate further, or he can always fall back on John's offer."
