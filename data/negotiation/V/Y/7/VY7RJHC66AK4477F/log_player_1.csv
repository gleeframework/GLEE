Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000 for it.  This reflects the fair market value based on my own research and budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
