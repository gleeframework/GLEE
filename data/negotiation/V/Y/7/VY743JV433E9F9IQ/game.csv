"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the $800,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go as low as $800,000. Would you consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but the gap between our valuations is still too large.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, but that's really the highest I can go at this point.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to a point where I need to make a decision.  To be frank, I have another potential buyer, but I'd prefer to work with you. My absolute lowest price for this is $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects how serious I am about closing this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me and being transparent about your other buyer. However, $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I can offer a maximum of $950,000.  If that doesn't work, I wish you the best with your other buyer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
