"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let's try to work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a little too high. I'm firm on my offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal right now.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer of $12,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,5,
