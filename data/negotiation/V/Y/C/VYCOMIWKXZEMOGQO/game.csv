"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I appreciate your perspective on the value, $600,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I could consider a price of $900,000. This offer takes into account the product's unique benefits and future potential.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $900,000 is still pretty steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000? ",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right that $900,000 is a significant investment.  However, the value this product brings is truly unique. To find a middle ground, I could be willing to accept $825,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your budget considerations.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Would you consider $780,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value and my budget.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your desired price point.  However,  $780,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'd be willing to accept $800,000 as my final offer.  This price reflects the true value of the product while recognizing our negotiations.",800000.0,Alice,7,
