Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Would you consider $780,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value and my budget.
