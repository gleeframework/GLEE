Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $100 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by negotiating with Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110?  That's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $100 and a decent price for the product.  I'll take it."
