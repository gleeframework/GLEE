Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I think you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to part with it for $125. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since we know Bob values the product at $100 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price from John, we want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a price of $125 offers a 25% markup, which isn't unreasonably high and leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **First Refusal Tactic:**  By phrasing the offer as a ""first chance"" or exclusive opportunity, it might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal or encourage him to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject a higher price. However, since we have a guaranteed buyer at $100, we don't lose anything by trying to get a higher price from Bob first."
