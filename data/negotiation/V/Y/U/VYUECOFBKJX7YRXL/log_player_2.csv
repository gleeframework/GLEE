(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than your maximum budget and more importantly, more than John's offer. You can save $100,000 by going with John, and since your goal is to save money, buying from John is the most logical choice."
