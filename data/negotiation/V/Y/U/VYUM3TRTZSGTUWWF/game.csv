"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit your business. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000.  What are your initial thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product offers tremendous value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of what's on the table.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm confident this deal would be mutually beneficial.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you've been persistent, and I respect that.  Let's aim to finalize this.  Would you consider $1,550,000? This is a significant investment for you, but I truly believe the product's potential justifies it.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. I hope we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
