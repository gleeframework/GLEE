"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product offers tremendous value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of what's on the table."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm confident this deal would be mutually beneficial. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. We are getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, but it's still worthwhile to counter-offer and see if we can push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been persistent, and I respect that.  Let's aim to finalize this.  Would you consider $1,550,000? This is a significant investment for you, but I truly believe the product's potential justifies it."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. I hope we can reach an agreement on this final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to reach our $1,500,000 minimum.  He's incrementally increasing his offer, but those increments are getting smaller. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower offer. We have a guaranteed sale with John at our desired price."
