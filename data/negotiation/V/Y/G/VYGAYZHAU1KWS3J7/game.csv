"I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",140.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a middle ground, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $150, which is fair for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $160, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory worth $20, so the total value you'll get is $180. I'll sell it to you for $170.",170.0,Alice,5,
