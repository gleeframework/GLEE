"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,750. It's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $10,750 is close, but I need to get at least $10,900 for this.  I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at that price.",10900.0,Alice,5,
