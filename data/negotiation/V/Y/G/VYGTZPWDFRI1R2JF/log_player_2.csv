# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. I believe it would be a great asset to your company. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point.  Bob has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential partnership, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still provides a good deal for both of us.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.
