"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is an excellent opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a price that is beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better deal than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This still provides you with a profit, and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your willingness to meet my minimum requirements, I would like to counter with a price of $11,000 for the product. This still offers a good profit margin while considering your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than the price from John and leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, as Alice has already shown a willingness to walk away."
