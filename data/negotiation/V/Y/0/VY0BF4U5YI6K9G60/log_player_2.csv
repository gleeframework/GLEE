"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  $10,000 is a good price, but there's potential to get it even lower. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal, and it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better deal than $10,000, Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. There are still rounds left, and Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet Alice halfway. By offering $8,500, Bob is still trying to save money, but he's also acknowledging that Alice may not be willing to go as low as $8,000. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a good deal."
