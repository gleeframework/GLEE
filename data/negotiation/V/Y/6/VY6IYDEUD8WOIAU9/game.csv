"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest. However, $120 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for it. Can you consider that?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in your product.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is the minimum I need to break even. If you're still interested, I'm open to discussing further, but I need to get at least $100 for the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",95.0,Bob,6,
