"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth $120. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its features and benefits.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can find common ground. I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. This reflects a compromise between the original asking price and your counteroffer, taking into account both the value of the product and your budget considerations.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $75. I think this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's features and the original price you mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's aim for a mutual agreement that respects both the value of the product and your budget constraints. I'm proposing a price of $85 for the product. This is slightly above your last offer, but still below the original price. It's a fair compromise that allows us to move forward with the transaction.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet at this price, as it's the same as what John is offering, and I'd rather buy from you if we can agree on it.",80.0,Bob,6,
