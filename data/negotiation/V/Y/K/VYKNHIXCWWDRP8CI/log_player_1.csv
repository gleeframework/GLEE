Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value, potentially justifying the price in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room:** While the offer is above Bob's perceived value, it's not astronomically high. This might encourage Bob to counter-offer rather than outright rejecting the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could explore other options like a slightly lower initial offer to appear more reasonable or even a more aggressive offer closer to $20,000."
