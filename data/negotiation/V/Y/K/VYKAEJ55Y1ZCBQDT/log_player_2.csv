"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best option. Here's why:

* **Saving money:**  You'll save $10 compared to buying from John. 
* **Within your budget:** $140 is less than your $150 limit. 

While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, there's no guarantee she'll go lower. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product within your budget."
