"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $14,000 is still too high for my budget. Could you do $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't go that low.  Would you consider $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
