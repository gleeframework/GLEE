"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Unfortunately, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's quality and the value it will bring to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I'm eager to make a deal and believe this price is fair.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
