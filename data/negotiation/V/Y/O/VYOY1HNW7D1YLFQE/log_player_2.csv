"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and quality. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a better price, as buying from John for $10,000 is a much better alternative at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Unfortunately, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong starting point:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and reasonable:**  The message is framed politely and explains that the initial offer is beyond the budget. This helps maintain a positive tone for negotiation.
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  This counteroffer will help understand how much Alice is willing to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's quality and the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down a bit, the offer is still higher than John's price.  There's room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come closer to the $10,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I'm eager to make a deal and believe this price is fair."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference (almost):** This counteroffer aims to split the difference between Alice's current offer ($10,500) and our previous offer ($8,000), but leans slightly closer to Alice's price.
* **Expressing eagerness:** The message emphasizes a desire to close the deal, which might encourage Alice to be more flexible.
* **Still leaving room:** While getting closer to John's price, this offer avoids going too low too quickly, allowing for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally matched John's price of $10,000.  There's no point in rejecting this offer and potentially losing the deal, especially since we'd be paying the same price with John anyway. Accepting now secures the product at the desired price."
