Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value for the product. I believe I can get a better price from Bob or potentially sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I want to get the best price,  I'm not sure I can convince Bob to go higher. John is offering me my minimum value, so it's the safest option to avoid risking a lower price or a failed negotiation."
