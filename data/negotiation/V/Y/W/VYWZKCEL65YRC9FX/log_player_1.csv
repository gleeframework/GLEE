Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price is still very fair considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob's willing to pay $15,000, so there's room for you to potentially increase the price further during negotiations.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  The price is likely attractive to Bob, considering the product's value to him. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than John's offer of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob and what you initially offered. 

It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a higher price. You can try to meet him halfway or push for a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a great price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're demonstrating that you're willing to negotiate, but not giving away too much. 
* **Offers a compromise:** You're proposing a price that's halfway between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Highlights the value:** You're reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750?  I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could keep negotiating, Bob's offer of $9,750 is close to your minimum and leaves little room for improvement. Accepting his offer is the best option since it's significantly higher than selling to John."
