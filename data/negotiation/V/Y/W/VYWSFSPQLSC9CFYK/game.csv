"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it, what do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120, which is the price I can get from John. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to sell it to you for $120, as that's the price I was willing to sell it to John for. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'll sell it to you for $125.",125.0,Alice,5,
