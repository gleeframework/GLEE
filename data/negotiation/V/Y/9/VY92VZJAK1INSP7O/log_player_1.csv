While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm not desperate and have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1,375,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm not desperate and have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. It's a lot of money to give up, and I'm not going to do it without a fight."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting very close to my desired price.  While I'm still $137,500 away from my ideal deal, I'm willing to accept his offer.  If I reject it, there's no guarantee that he'll come up further, and I risk losing the sale entirely.  It's a good deal considering the guaranteed sale to John, and I'm confident I can make up the difference elsewhere."
