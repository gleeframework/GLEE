"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's starting offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate to try and get a better price, closer to her product value."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $125 to make this worthwhile.  Let me know if you're interested in that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to her value, but I still think there's room to negotiate. I'll counter with a price closer to her value but still leaving me some wiggle room."

{
""message"": ""I understand you need a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
