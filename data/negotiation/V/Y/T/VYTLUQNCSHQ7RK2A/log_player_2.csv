"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $100 to both of us. I would like to propose a price of $95 for it. I believe this is a fair deal that allows us both to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth $100 to you, you have room to go lower than Alice's offer without losing out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm happy to pay $85 for the product. This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate as well. I would like to counter with an offer of $90 for the product. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice's offer is $90. You are saving $10, which is a decent discount. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal, especially since John's price is $100."
