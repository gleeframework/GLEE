Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $15,000, and I'm hoping to get a price close to that. Would you be willing to pay $19,000 for it?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, providing a reason (even if it's just your own valuation) can make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Counter Offer:** By offering a price significantly higher than your minimum, you give Bob room to counter-offer. This keeps the negotiation open and allows you to gauge his interest level.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always come down in price. She has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so any price Bob accepts above that is a profit."
