Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your business acumen, and I'm confident it can be a real game-changer for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, I'm not quite comfortable with that price point. I'd be willing to buy it for $700,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for your business.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair price considering the immense value it offers."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a tricky situation. While we could try to push for more in the next round, Bob landing at $800,000 puts him right at John's offer.  There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and we risk losing him as a buyer altogether. It's better to accept a sure thing than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or no sale at all."
