Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for this product. I believe it's a fair price, given the potential benefits you mentioned. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1025000. This is a fair price, considering the value I've placed on the product. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm comfortable with $1,000,000. This would allow us both to move forward with the sale and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits we've discussed. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pushing the Negotiation:**  This counteroffer continues to push Alice towards your desired price point.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  $1,000,000 is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Reminding Alice of the potential benefits emphasizes the value you see in the product and justifies your offer."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1015000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer is only $15,000 above your target price of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price or failing to reach a deal outweighs the potential gain of a few thousand dollars.
* **Potential for Deal Break:**  Further negotiation may lead to a deadlock, forcing you to buy from John at a significantly higher price.

While it's not your ideal price, accepting this offer ensures a deal and saves you a substantial amount compared to John's price."
