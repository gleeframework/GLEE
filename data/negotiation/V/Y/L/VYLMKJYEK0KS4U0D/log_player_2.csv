"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the market value is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $9,500 is less than $10,000. 
* **You still save money:** Even though you're paying more than the product's value to Alice ($8,000), you're still saving $500 compared to buying from John."
