Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price.  However, it's important to remember that I have a safety net with John's offer of $1,500,000, so I can't afford to be too greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is still fair while remaining closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is still a good deal. It's above my minimum price and allows me to avoid the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower offer or even losing him as a buyer entirely. Selling to John would also guarantee me a good price, but Bob's offer is better, so I will accept it."
