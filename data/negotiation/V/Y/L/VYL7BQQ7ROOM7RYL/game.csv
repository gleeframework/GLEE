"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $900,000.  This is still a good price for you, as it's significantly higher than your value of $800,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's work together to make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make it happen if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. It's a significant discount for you and a great value for me. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to close the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
