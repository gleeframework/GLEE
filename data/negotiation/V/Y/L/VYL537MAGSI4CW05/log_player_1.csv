"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This gives Bob a little room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  Since the product is worth $150 to him, this is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $150 and I believe I can get a better deal. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It gives him a little more room to negotiate, but it still leaves me with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $145 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with the profit margin. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $155. This is a significant concession, but I believe it's necessary to keep the negotiation going. Bob is clearly willing to pay more than $145, so this offer gives him a good deal while still allowing me to meet my minimum price."
