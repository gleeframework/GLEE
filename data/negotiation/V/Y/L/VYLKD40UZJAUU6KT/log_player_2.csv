Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it for $800,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly better than John's offer within the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the guaranteed lower price from John."
