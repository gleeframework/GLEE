"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it for $800,000. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. It's a fair price, considering the benefits you'll gain from having this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. It's a fair price, considering the benefits you'll gain from having this product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
