"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is reflective of the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This considers the long-term value and competitive advantage you'll gain.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
