Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your confidence in the product's potential value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I am willing to offer $1000000 for the product, which I believe is a fair reflection of its worth. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. He's already shown interest, so there's potential to negotiate further."

While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. This will be a quick and clean sale, and it's more than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
