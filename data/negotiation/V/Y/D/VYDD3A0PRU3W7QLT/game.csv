"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it holds even greater potential for you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This price reflects its value and my confidence in your ability to leverage it.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your confidence in the product's potential value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I am willing to offer $1000000 for the product, which I believe is a fair reflection of its worth. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $1000000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the value I see in this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This compromise shows my desire to work with you, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
