Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Anchoring:** By presenting a high initial price, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if Bob rejects the offer, his counteroffer might be more favorable than if you had started lower. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps you understand how much Bob values the product and how eager he is to purchase it. 

It's important to remember that you have John as a backup offer, ensuring you won't be forced to settle for less than your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go that high.  To show my serious interest, I'd like to offer you $1,300,000. This price would give us both a fair deal and allow us to move forward quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum ($1,500,000) and your initial asking price.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a higher price and are willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the value this product brings.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects the true potential of what we're discussing."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You're making a significant concession from your initial offer ($200,000 decrease) to show Bob you're willing to negotiate.
* **Holding Ground:** You're still significantly above both Bob's valuation and his offer. This keeps the negotiation moving but ensures you don't concede too much too quickly.
* **Justification:** By framing the price reduction as ""fair"" and highlighting the product's potential, you're reinforcing the value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,700,000 is still beyond what I can afford right now.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Guaranteed Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. 
* **No Further Movement Likely:** Bob's message suggests he's made his best offer and is unlikely to go much higher.

Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a stalemate or a lower final offer. Accepting John's offer ensures you get your minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
