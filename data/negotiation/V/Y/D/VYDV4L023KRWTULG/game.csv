"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go that high.  To show my serious interest, I'd like to offer you $1,300,000. This price would give us both a fair deal and allow us to move forward quickly.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the value this product brings.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects the true potential of what we're discussing.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,700,000 is still beyond what I can afford right now.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
