**Reasoning:**

While $95 is close to my maximum budget, there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a lower price before considering John's offer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $90.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $87.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your patience and understanding, Bob. After considering your proposal, I am willing to offer the product at $89. This price reflects the value we place on the product and allows us to maintain our profit margin. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and I'm now within $2 of my initial target of $85. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal entirely or having to pay John's higher price is now too high. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
