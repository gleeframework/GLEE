Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum asking price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the market value.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell below $800,000. I'll try to counteroffer again and see if we can bridge the gap."

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I've already made several concessions and I don't want to continue negotiating for a lower price. John is willing to pay my minimum asking price and I don't want to risk losing that deal."
