"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a good margin for you. Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that still leaves room for a good margin for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and gives you a decent profit. I'm confident we can come to an agreement if we both make a little effort.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're a tough negotiator! I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,150,000 yet. I'm willing to offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1,250,000? This is my final offer for now, and I'm confident we can get a deal done at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  Let's finalize this deal at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that ensures both of us get a good outcome.  This is my final offer. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to meet me at $1,200,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept it yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,220,000? This is my last offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
