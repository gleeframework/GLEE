"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I'm ready to make a deal today.",8500.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",16000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,14000.0
"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, Bob. I think the product's value is worth more than $10,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm going to stick to my last offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",10000.0,Bob,6,,
