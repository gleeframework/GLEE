# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find immensely valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this brings to your specific needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,275,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than the $1,100,000 counteroffer.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer closer to $1,100,000 is the best option to potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. While $1,187,500 is closer to where I see the value, I'm ready to close this deal.  I'll accept $1,225,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your strong interest.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

* **Bob's maximum budget:** $1,500,000
