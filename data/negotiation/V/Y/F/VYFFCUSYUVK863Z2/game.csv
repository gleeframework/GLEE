"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find immensely valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this brings to your specific needs.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,275,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,187,500 for the product.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.",1187500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. While $1,187,500 is closer to where I see the value, I'm ready to close this deal.  I'll accept $1,225,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your strong interest. ",1225000.0,Alice,5,
