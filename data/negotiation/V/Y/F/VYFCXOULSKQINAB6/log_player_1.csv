I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that allows for potential negotiation. It's important to remember that I'm aiming to maximize my earnings while still considering the possibility of selling to John for $800,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still positions me to make a good profit.  It's also closer to my initial asking price, which may encourage Bob to come up slightly in his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise.  While it's not my initial asking price, it's significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000 and gets me closer to my goal of maximizing earnings. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
