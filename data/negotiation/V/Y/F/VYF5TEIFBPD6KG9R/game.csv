"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a little too high for me.  Let's try $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $110, which is $102.50. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
