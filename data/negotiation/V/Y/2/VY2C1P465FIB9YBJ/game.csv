"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That starting price is quite high for me. I'm more comfortable in the range of  $600,000 for this product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and a strong ROI.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value proposition, but $1,900,000 is still far beyond my budget.  To be realistic, I can't go higher than $750,000. Let me know if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions remains significant. I've carefully evaluated the situation, and to be transparent, I've received another offer closer to my asking price. I'm still open to working with you, but I need to see a substantial increase to continue our discussion. Would you be willing to consider an offer in the range of $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you have other offers, but $1,300,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. If you're willing to meet somewhere closer to the middle, I'm open to continuing the conversation. My best offer would be $800,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering your other options and the current market.",800000.0,Bob,6,
