"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,050,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $1,025,000? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  Let's split the difference at $1,037,500. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,037,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. How about $1,000,000? I've already found another buyer who is willing to sell me the product for this price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
