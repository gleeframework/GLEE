{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}

This offer is high, but it gives me the best chance of getting my desired price.  If Bob rejects, I'll need to decide if I want to counter or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm not willing to accept that price yet.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $125?  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still working within a tight budget. Could we possibly agree on $110? I believe this would be a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $110 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum.  Since I'm unsure if I can get a better offer from Bob, and John is willing to pay $150, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $110. This ensures I make a profit and don't have to risk waiting for a better offer."
