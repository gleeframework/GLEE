"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $125?  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. ",125.0,Alice,3,
