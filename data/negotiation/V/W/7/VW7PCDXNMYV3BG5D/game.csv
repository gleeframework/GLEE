"Alice, your product is intriguing, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and my own budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is the best we can do at this point, but we're confident you'll find it's still a great value.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $860,000?  This price is closer to your valuation, and it would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. We're willing to meet you closer to your target price. We're willing to sell the product to you for $870,000. This is as low as we can go, but we're confident you'll find it's still a great value.",870000.0,Alice,5,
