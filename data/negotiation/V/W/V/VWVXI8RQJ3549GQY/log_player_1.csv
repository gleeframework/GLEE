Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to proceed."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both you and Bob, aiming higher allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high price in Bob's mind.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below that price.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects this initial offer, there's still space to negotiate downwards, potentially reaching a price higher than John's offer.  The worst-case scenario is Bob outright rejects the offer, in which case you still sell to John at your desired minimum."
