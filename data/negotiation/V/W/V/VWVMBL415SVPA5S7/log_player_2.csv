Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it fits nicely within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to bring the price down a bit further.  How about we meet at $1,100,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing Alice that you're serious about acquiring the product.  However, it's still below Alice's latest offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise while remaining within your budget. This move should encourage Alice to accept or come back with a counteroffer closer to your desired price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,120,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and while it's slightly higher than your ideal price, it's still significantly lower than what you'd pay John.  Accepting this offer secures the product within your budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price or the need to buy from John."
