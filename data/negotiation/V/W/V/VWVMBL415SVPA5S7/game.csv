"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it fits nicely within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to bring the price down a bit further.  How about we meet at $1,100,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,120,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,5,
