"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product.  However, I'm not quite ready to commit to that price yet. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product and allows us to both reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
