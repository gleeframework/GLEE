"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  Since I have 10 rounds, I can afford to reject and counteroffer.  I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product.  However, I'm not quite ready to commit to that price yet. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay.  I'm aiming to start a negotiation where I can slowly move the price down.  The message is friendly, but firm, indicating I'm serious about buying the product but not at the current price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I'm confident I can negotiate further, especially since I have 7 rounds left. I want to continue pushing for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product and allows us to both reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a moderate increase from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to move but not drastically.  The message is polite and emphasizes a fair compromise, hoping to encourage Alice to accept. This strategy aims to reach a deal sooner while keeping my budget in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,050,000. While I could try to negotiate further, we're already halfway through the rounds.  It's likely we'll continue to haggle back and forth.  Accepting this offer saves me $425,000 compared to buying from John, and it's likely I won't be able to get a significantly lower price.  It's a good deal for me."
