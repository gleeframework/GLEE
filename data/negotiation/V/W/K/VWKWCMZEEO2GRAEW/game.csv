"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $8,000.  I understand this is a lower price than you're hoping for, but it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
