"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product for significantly less from John.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still too high.  He can get the product for his desired price of $8,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, but he should be prepared to walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $8,000.  I understand this is a lower price than you're hoping for, but it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice has shown she's unwilling to go lower than $11,000, which is still above Bob's budget.  He can get the product for his desired price from John, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
