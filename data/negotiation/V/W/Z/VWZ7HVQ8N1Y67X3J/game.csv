"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1300000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my financial limits.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1300000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1350000 to show my commitment to finding a solution. This would still offer you a great deal considering the product's value to you. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
