"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and it's a fair price considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'll meet you at $920,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",920000.0,Alice,5,
