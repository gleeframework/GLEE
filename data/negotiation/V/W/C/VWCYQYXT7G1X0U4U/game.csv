"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think!",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $95?  That's a good compromise, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll sell it to you for $105. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you!",105.0,Alice,5,
