"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that 85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try 92? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, Alice.  However, $92 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm still happy to pay $85, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a bit of a discount, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slight concession. How about we try 88? It's still a good price for me, and I think it's a fair compromise.",88.0,Alice,5,
