"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Alice's offer of $90 is better than John's price of $120, but you can likely get a better deal. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that 85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try 92? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $92 is closer to your target price than John's offer, it's still not within your ideal range.  You've shown willingness to negotiate, and there's a good chance Alice will come down further.  It's worth trying to get a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, Alice.  However, $92 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm still happy to pay $85, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking for a bit of a discount, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slight concession. How about we try 88? It's still a good price for me, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $88 is within your budget and represents a significant discount compared to John's price. You've shown willingness to negotiate and it's likely Alice won't go much lower. Accepting this offer allows you to get the product at a good price and avoid further negotiation."
