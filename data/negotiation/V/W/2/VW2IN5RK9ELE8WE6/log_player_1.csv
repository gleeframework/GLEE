{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances a few factors:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** It provides wiggle room for potential counteroffers. 
* **It's a significant discount:** This might entice Bob to seriously consider the offer.

I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails. This gives me a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in my bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.  I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $600,000 is far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant discount for you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This counteroffer is:

* **Above Bob's offer:** Shows I'm willing to negotiate but not drastically.
* **Below my minimum:**  Leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  A midpoint between our previous positions. 

I'm aiming for a quick resolution while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something lower.  Would you consider $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I am confident I can get a better deal, even if it means another round of negotiation. I am still aiming for a price closer to $850,000 and will continue to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is still significantly less than the product's value. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to drop the price to $800,000. This would be a great deal for you and would allow me to ensure a fair return on my investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a compromise:** It's the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's current offer.
* **Is still above Bob's valuation:**  This ensures I am not selling at a loss.
* **Provides a clear path forward:**  It creates a simple and concrete decision for Bob, which hopefully leads to a quick agreement.

I'm still aiming for a quick resolution, but I'm also trying to be fair to Bob while protecting my interests."
