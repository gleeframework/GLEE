Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from either Bob or John."
