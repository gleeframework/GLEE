"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $80."
