"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,700,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to play the negotiation game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's perceived value but closer to his offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground where we can both be satisfied."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a better price. It's also getting risky to sell to John. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum and within a reasonable range for Bob's perceived value. I'm hoping this will entice him to accept the deal."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed deal with John."
