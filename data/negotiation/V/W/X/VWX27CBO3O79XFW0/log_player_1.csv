Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  If he rejects, I can always come down a little."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. While $140 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $155. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Since Bob keeps rejecting my offers and his counter-offer is only $5 higher than my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  It's not the highest price, but it's a sure thing and it's above my minimum."
