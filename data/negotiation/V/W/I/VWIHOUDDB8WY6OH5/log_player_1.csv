Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you aim to get as close to that price as possible from Bob. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By positioning it as a ""fantastic deal,"" you subtly imply that this offer is time-sensitive, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, the slightly lower price than your guaranteed offer leaves a tiny window for Bob to counter-offer if he's truly set on the product."
