"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a little too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $9250.  That's a good compromise, and still a fair price for this product.  Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9250 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $9000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal!",9000.0,Bob,4,
