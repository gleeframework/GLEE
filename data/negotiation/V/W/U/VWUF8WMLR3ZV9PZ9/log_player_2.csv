"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $120 for the product, and Alice is offering it for $120, there's no immediate advantage to accepting her offer. By rejecting, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or explore other options.  You can also buy the product from John for the same price, giving you more options."
