Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special discounted price of $135. I think it would be a great fit for you, and this offer is only available for a limited time."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Don't undervalue:** Starting at $135 allows room for negotiation while ensuring you get more than Bob's perceived value if he accepts.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning a ""limited time"" offer might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving John as a backup:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed your minimum acceptable price from John. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings by potentially securing a price higher than Bob's perceived value, while still having a safety net in place."
