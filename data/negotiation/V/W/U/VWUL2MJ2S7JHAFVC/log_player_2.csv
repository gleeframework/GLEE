"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. I believe this price reflects the value it provides, and I'm confident it will meet your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to establish a starting point significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but leaves room for negotiation. It also maintains a polite and interested tone to encourage further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. After considering your offer, I am unable to accept $65 for the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about $80? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80.

Alice has met your upper limit. There's no point in further negotiation or buying from John for the same price."
