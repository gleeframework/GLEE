"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be of great benefit to your business.  I understand its value to you is significant, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  My minimum acceptable offer is $1350000, which represents a substantial gain for both of us.  Please consider this proposal carefully. If we can't reach an agreement, I have another buyer lined up at a lower price.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
