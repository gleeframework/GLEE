Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price.  This ensures I maximize my potential profit.  If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get closer to $1,000,000 by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still less than my ideal price, it's closer to $1,000,000 than my previous counteroffer, and it's more than John's offer.  It's also possible that Bob might reject my counteroffer, and the negotiations could drag on. This deal guarantees a profit and closes the transaction."
