,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my original offer. How about $850,000? This price still gives you a good deal, considering the value you mentioned. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? ",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $725,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference and go with $775,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Alice,5,
