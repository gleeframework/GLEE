"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in this product, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $13,000 is already a fair price, reflecting the value this product brings. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,500. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? That feels like a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
