"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $13,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good price, it's still above what the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in this product, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $13,000 is already a fair price, reflecting the value this product brings. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob still has room to negotiate a lower price.  He's willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is above the product's worth to her.  A counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get a better price."
