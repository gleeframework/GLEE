"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable paying $18000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $10000. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $12000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your revised offer of $16000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $15500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a bit closer to what I'm looking for.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $15500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $13500. I think this is the best I can do, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",13500.0,Bob,6,
