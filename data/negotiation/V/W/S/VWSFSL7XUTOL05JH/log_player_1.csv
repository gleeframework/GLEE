"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's better to start with a price that gives you some room to negotiate down. 
* **Adding a personal touch:**  The message helps build a rapport and positions the product as valuable.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $200 leaves room for a back-and-forth, while still being above your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $150. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum:** While $150 is your absolute minimum, it's still worth exploring if you can get more.
* **Potential for a better price:** There are still 8 rounds left. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can potentially get a higher price. 
* **No downside to rejecting:** Rejecting doesn't hurt you â€“ you can always come back to $150 later. 

**Next Round:** You should send Bob a counteroffer closer to your initial price.  You can also highlight the value of the product to try to convince him to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $150 is your limit, the product is worth more than that to me. To show you I'm serious about making this work, I'm willing to come down to $175. This is a good price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:**  Lowering to $175 shows flexibility but doesn't give away too much.
* **Highlighting value:**  Emphasize the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Positive framing:**  Use language like ""good price for both of us"" to make it seem like a win-win."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $160 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on a deal:** Bob has moved closer to your preferred price. 
* **Limited time:**  You're already in round 4.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob and then having to settle with John for $150.
* **Acceptable profit:** $160 is a good profit for you, especially considering you started at $200.

**Next steps:** While you're accepting Bob's offer, you can still try to finalize the deal quickly and ensure a smooth transaction."
