,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $900,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value you place on the product while still allowing me to recoup a significant portion of its worth. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. However, $1,050,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle, at $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for your business, and I'm committed to making this deal work.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I can get from the product without overpaying.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal here.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000. This is a compromise that acknowledges your needs while still allowing me to recoup a significant portion of the value I placed on this product. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for your business, and I believe this price reflects that value.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1040000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,015,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I can get from the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1015000.0,Bob,8,
