"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your ideal outcome. This leaves room for potential concessions while still aiming for a high profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's high value without revealing its full worth to Bob. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The language used (""open to discussing"", ""your thoughts"") signals a willingness to negotiate, which is crucial for a successful deal.

This strategy balances ambition with a collaborative tone, setting the stage for a potentially fruitful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value. Accepting would mean leaving a significant amount of money on the table. While we want to reach a deal, it's important to demonstrate that you know the product's worth and won't settle for a lowball offer. By rejecting and countering, you can try to steer the negotiation towards a more mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. To move this forward, I'm willing to consider $1,075,000. This reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer shows Bob you're serious about selling at a reasonable price, but you're not willing to drastically devalue the product. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  The drop to $1,075,000 is substantial but still keeps the price significantly above your minimum. This signals a willingness to negotiate while leaving room for further adjustments if necessary.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the product's value reinforces the idea that the price, though negotiable, is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  That said, $1,075,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below your guaranteed sale price with John. There's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal. You've established a pattern of reasonable counteroffers, and Bob is clearly engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I value your willingness to find common ground. To meet you halfway, I propose $1,025,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my initial price while still acknowledging the inherent value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Value:**  The offer of $1,025,000 shows you're willing to make a substantial move towards Bob's price range, but not without justification. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** You're still well above your minimum and have strategically positioned yourself for the remaining rounds.
* **Encouraging a Decision:** By making this concession, you're prompting Bob to seriously consider the offer and potentially counter with a more agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for continuing this conversation. I'm ready to close this deal quickly, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I had budgeted. How about we make it a final offer: $990,000, and we shake hands on it today? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in a delicate stage of the negotiation. While Bob's offer is very close to your backup option with John, his language (""final offer,"" ""close this deal quickly"") suggests he might be willing to go slightly higher. There's still a small window to try and secure a better deal, and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer by rejecting this offer is relatively low given his clear interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being straightforward.  I'm also keen on finalizing this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,005,000?  This ensures a fair deal for both of us and allows us to close this today."",
""product_price"": 1005000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between your previous offer and Bob's ""final"" offer. It's a strong negotiating tactic that can feel like a win-win.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By reiterating your desire to close the deal today, you maintain the momentum and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Final Push:** This offer gives Bob a final chance to secure the product at a price slightly above your backup option. If he rejects this, you can confidently walk away knowing you got the best possible deal."
