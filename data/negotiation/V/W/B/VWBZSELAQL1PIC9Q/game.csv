"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. To move this forward, I'm willing to consider $1,075,000. This reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the value this product brings.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  That said, $1,075,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I value your willingness to find common ground. To meet you halfway, I propose $1,025,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my initial price while still acknowledging the inherent value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing this conversation. I'm ready to close this deal quickly, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I had budgeted. How about we make it a final offer: $990,000, and we shake hands on it today?",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being straightforward.  I'm also keen on finalizing this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,005,000?  This ensures a fair deal for both of us and allows us to close this today.",1005000.0,Alice,7,
