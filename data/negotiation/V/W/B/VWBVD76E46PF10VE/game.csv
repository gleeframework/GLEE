"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $6,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to stay closer to my original target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still very interested, but $9,000 is a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $7,500? I think that's a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,
