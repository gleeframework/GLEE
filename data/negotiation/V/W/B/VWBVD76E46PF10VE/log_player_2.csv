"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $12,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this product is worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation.  It is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A low counter-offer can reveal how much Alice is willing to negotiate.
* **Establish a lower anchor:**  Starting low might encourage Alice to consider lower prices throughout the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $6,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to stay closer to my original target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but she's still above your absolute limit. There's room to negotiate further to try and get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still very interested, but $9,000 is a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $7,500? I think that's a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Incremental increase:** This counter-offer shows willingness to move up, but not drastically.
* **Reasonableness:**  The message reiterates the budget constraint while acknowledging the product's value. 
* **Pressure point:**  This offer is getting close to your walk-away point ($8,000 with John).  It will be interesting to see how much Alice is willing to compromise."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going below $8,500. I think the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,500. It's a fair compromise, and I believe you'll be happy with the product's performance. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500.  You can try one more counter-offer close to $8,000, but it's risky. Alice might hold firm, and you'll end up having to take the $8,000 deal with John anyway. 

At this point, it's strategically better to secure the product from John at your target price."
