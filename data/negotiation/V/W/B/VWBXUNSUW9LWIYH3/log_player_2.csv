Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing willingness to compromise. It's still below Alice's current offer and closer to her minimum value, increasing the chance of acceptance.  It leaves room for further negotiation if needed, while still saving you a significant amount compared to buying from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still a good deal, saving you $275,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation is possible, but there's a risk that Alice might reject your next counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price and avoids any potential risks."
