Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I'm confident it's something you'll find highly valuable.  My asking price is $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've started with a price of $1,150,000. This is a good starting point because:
    * It's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
    * It leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to Bob's value of $1,200,000.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. It also positions the price as ""fair"".

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to:

1. **Start high:**  By starting at $1,150,000, I create room for negotiation and hopefully get a good price.
2. **Be flexible:** I'm willing to negotiate and counteroffer if necessary.
3. **Have a fallback:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 gives me a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fall apart, I can still sell for a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $1050000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While $1,050,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 
* **Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is still significantly below my initial offer and what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm flexible while still trying to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,050,000 is a tempting offer, I need to make sure I get a fair value for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and the potential benefit it can bring to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's budget concerns but also emphasizes the value of the product. It's still a firm offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not give in entirely. 
* **Price:** The price of $1,100,000 is a compromise: 
    * It's lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
    * It's higher than Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

**Strategy:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway in terms of price, showing a willingness to negotiate while still being firm about my value of the product.
* **Leaving Room:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I still have room to lower the price a bit more in future counteroffers. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, so even if the negotiation goes a bit further, I'm still in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose a price of $1075000. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the product's potential benefits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:**  While it's still a bit below my initial desired price, Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Reasoning:**  
    * Further negotiation might yield a slightly better price, but it's not guaranteed. 
    * The risk of Bob walking away or continuing to haggle for a lower price is high.
    * Accepting this offer secures a sale and a good profit, which is important considering John's offer is a fallback. 

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  I'm balancing the potential for a slightly higher price with the risk of losing the deal entirely. 
* **Secure the Sale:** This offer allows me to close the deal and move on to other opportunities.
* **Minimizing Losses:** While it's not the ideal price, I'm still getting a good return on the product."
