"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000?  I think that's a fair compromise given the value of the product to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,350,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal quickly.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
