"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate and try to get closer to my target of $1,400,000.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000?  I think that's a fair compromise given the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,350,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $1,350,000. This is a good deal for me, as it's well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's also likely that if I reject this offer, Bob might not come up any higher, and I risk losing a good deal.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a good profit and a quick sale."
