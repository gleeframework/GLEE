Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $850,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $900,000.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $910,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. How about we try $915,500? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to walk away.  Alice is clearly very attached to getting a price above $910,000.  While another round *might* get you a slightly better price, it's not worth the risk of her digging in further. You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, and at this point, any potential savings with Alice are outweighed by the potential loss of having to accept an even higher price."
