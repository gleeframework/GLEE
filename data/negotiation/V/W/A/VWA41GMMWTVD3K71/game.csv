"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,600,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
