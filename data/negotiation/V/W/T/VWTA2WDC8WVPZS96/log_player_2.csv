"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Rejecting Alice's offer makes sense. You're willing to pay $12,000, but there's a chance to get a better price.  You'll see if Alice is willing to come down further, otherwise, John is your backup."
