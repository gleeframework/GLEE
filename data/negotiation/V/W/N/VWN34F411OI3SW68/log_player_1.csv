"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is my initial offer to Bob. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my value, but I'm also aware of the potential for a counteroffer and want to leave room for a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm still hopeful to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering a price of $9,500, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it's a compromise that might be more appealing to Bob. I'm trying to find a price that's in the middle ground between our two valuations. I'm also expressing my confidence in the product's value to him, hoping to influence his decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $9000? I think that's a fair price that we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate. I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I'm hoping to get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm offering a price of $9,250. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also adding a sense of urgency by suggesting to ""close the deal."" This might motivate Bob to accept my offer."
