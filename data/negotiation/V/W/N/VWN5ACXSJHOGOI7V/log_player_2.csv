"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's not a good deal for you, and you should try to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the product's value is considerably higher than that to me.  I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product offers.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget. You can still negotiate further to try and get a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
