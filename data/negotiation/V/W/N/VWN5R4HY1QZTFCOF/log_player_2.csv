Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is closer to his ideal price point, he can still try to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer and counter-offering gives him another chance to get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit high.  How about $11,000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,750. It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for this amazing product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,750 is closer to Bob's ideal price point than John's offer of $15,000, it's still above Bob's preferred price. Bob has a few more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to push for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $11,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,250. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $12,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to what Bob is willing to pay than John's offer of $15,000, it's still above his preferred price point. Bob has a few more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I hear you, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $11,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,750, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only one round left to negotiate with Alice.  While $11,750 is slightly better than John's price, it's still not a great deal for Bob.  Considering the limited time and the risk of not getting a better offer from Alice, it's more prudent for Bob to buy from John.  He's guaranteed to get the product within his budget, even if it's not the absolute lowest price possible."
