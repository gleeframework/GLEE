Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while still allowing for a good profit margin.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly tone sets a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing the negotiation to progress. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and inviting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could you consider offering the product at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold of $100. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room to negotiate a higher price.  I can counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John guarantees $100, but I believe I can get a better price through further negotiation with Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings by continuing the negotiation, with the goal of getting a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm eager to see this product find a good home, $85 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $87.50? This would still give you a great deal and allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 87.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns.
* **Fairness:** The price is still above Bob's perceived value, making it a win-win situation.

This strategy aims to reach an agreement quickly and efficiently, while still securing a price that is acceptable to me."
