"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to test the waters and see how much she's willing to negotiate.  This leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  I can potentially get the product for the same price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $9,500. This is still below Alice's offer of $10,500 but closer to her asking price, indicating that I'm willing to negotiate further. It also leaves room for a final counteroffer before I decide to buy from John."
