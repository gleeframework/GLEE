"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $775,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
