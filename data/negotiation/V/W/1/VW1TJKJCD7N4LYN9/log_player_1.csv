Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to find a good deal.  While your offer is appreciated, the value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects its true worth and allows for a win-win scenario."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, it's still significantly below its value to him ($1,200,000).  We have room to negotiate further and try to secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a significant move, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has come up to $950,000, and while we'd ideally like to get to $1,000,000, his offer is now a strong one. Holding out further risks him lowering his offer or us missing the deal altogether. It's a good profit above our minimum, and time to close the deal."
