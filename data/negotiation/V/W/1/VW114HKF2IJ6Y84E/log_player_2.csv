"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose the specifics just yet, I assure you it's worth no less than $1500000 to me. I'm confident it can deliver significant benefits for you.  Would you be interested in exploring this further? My asking price is $2000000, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* While the product might be valuable, the risk of overpaying is too high.
* I can purchase the same product from John for a price I'm comfortable with."
