Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I value at least $100. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know Bob values the product at. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Reasoning:** I've explained the value I place on the product to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I've phrased the message to invite Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving room for a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's tempting to accept $70, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is a much better outcome.
* **Negotiation potential:** I can still try to negotiate with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, and potentially reach a compromise. 

I'm willing to explore further negotiation with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer of $85 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $90 and Bob's offer of $70. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I reiterate that the price is fair for both of us, subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $85 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground and reach a deal with Bob, while still protecting my minimum earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $80.  It's a fair offer and saves us both some time haggling. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $80 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Bob's offer is a fair compromise and saves us both further negotiation.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too inflexible. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though I'm accepting a price below my ideal, this deal might lead to future business with Bob, where I could potentially achieve higher prices.

Therefore, I'm accepting Bob's offer and selling the product for $80.  While it's not my ideal outcome, it's a reasonable compromise that secures a sale and allows for potential future opportunities."
