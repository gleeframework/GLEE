"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. By offering $1,200,000, he's aiming for a price that's still attractive to Alice (above her valuation) but offers a substantial savings for Bob. This counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness about buying the product while also establishing a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his ideal outcome. There's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get the price down further by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility.  $1,250,000 is still a good deal for both parties, as it's above Alice's valuation and below Bob's maximum. This approach aims to encourage Alice to accept while ensuring Bob gets a better deal than Alice's last offer."
