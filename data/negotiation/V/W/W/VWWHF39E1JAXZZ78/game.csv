"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $14,000 is still a little high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $13,000. This is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
