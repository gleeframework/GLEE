"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than $150 from John, you can potentially get a better deal.  By rejecting, you open the door for negotiation and might be able to get the price down closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $130. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still potentially profitable for her. 

I'm aiming to find a price that is fair for both of us and allows me to save money. We'll see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is now within my acceptable range.  Although I would prefer to pay even less, it is closer to my desired price than John's $150.  Further negotiation could result in a lower price, but there's a risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially increasing the price. It's better to accept her offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
