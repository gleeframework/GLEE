"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $18,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm starting high to give us some room to work with.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $14,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's a compromise, but I think it's worth considering.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $11,000? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $13,000, which is still a good profit for me and a decent price for you. It's my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,5,
