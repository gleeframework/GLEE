Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $13,000, which is still a good profit for me and a decent price for you. It's my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $13,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $12,000 and avoid further negotiation."
