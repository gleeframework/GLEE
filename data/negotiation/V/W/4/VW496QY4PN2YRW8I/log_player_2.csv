# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and requirements. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $14,000 for the product. This price not only reflects its worth but also provides you with an opportunity to acquire it at a competitive rate compared to its market value of $15,000. I look forward to your positive response and the chance to assist you with this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above your maximum budget. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with buying from John for $15,000. While buying from John is slightly more expensive, it's still within your budget and ensures you get the product."
