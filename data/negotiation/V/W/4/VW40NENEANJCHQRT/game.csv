I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product for a limited time. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.,1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value and my own budget constraints.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price that's closer to your budget, but still reflects the value of the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1180000.",1180000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $1180000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $1050000. Let's split the difference at $1115000.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",1115000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can see that you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1190000, which is closer to my original offer, but still a compromise. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However,  $1190000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget constraints.  Let me know if you're open to this.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
