Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Strong Alternative:** I have a strong alternative buyer (John) at $8,000, giving me leverage. I don't need to desperately lowball the price.

This strategy aims to secure a price that benefits both parties while maximizing my profit."
