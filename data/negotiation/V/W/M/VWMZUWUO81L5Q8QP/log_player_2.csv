"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000.  You can likely get a better price by rejecting her offer. By rejecting, you signal that the price is too high, potentially leading Alice to make a counter-offer."
