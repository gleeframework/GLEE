{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and the opportunity to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $110 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to accept that. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a counteroffer closer to my minimum while still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $75 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $85, but I really can't go any lower.  Let's try to work something out, I think this product is definitely worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 85} 
``` 

I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still holding out for a little more. I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference at $81.50? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 81.50}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher counteroffer than Bob's last one, but still significantly lower than my starting price. I'm trying to reach a compromise while emphasizing the value of a deal for both parties."
