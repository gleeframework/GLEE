{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $120 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 
I'm going to lower my price slightly to $140, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $110 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum and I've already gone through three rounds.  Given that I have John waiting to buy at $120, it makes more sense to sell to him now and avoid further negotiation."
