"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product.  Given its unique qualities, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable arrangement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a fair negotiation.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's close this deal. How about $1,550,000? This is my final offer.",1550000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I understand this is your final offer, but I can't quite meet that price.  My absolute limit is $1,525,000. Let's seal the deal.",1525000.0,Bob,8,
