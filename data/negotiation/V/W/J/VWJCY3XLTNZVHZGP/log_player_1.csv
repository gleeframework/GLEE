"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,350,000 is getting closer, we are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see Bob moving closer to the $1,500,000 mark."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting very close to my baseline, but I believe I can still get a bit more out of this negotiation.  I'm willing to push him a little further in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's close this deal. How about $1,550,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm pushing slightly above my minimum to encourage Bob to settle. This leaves a small margin for him to negotiate down, while still ensuring I get more than John's offer. Marking this as my ""final offer"" adds weight and might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I understand this is your final offer, but I can't quite meet that price.  My absolute limit is $1,525,000. Let's seal the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering more than John's guaranteed price.  While I'd prefer the full $1,550,000, accepting his counteroffer ensures I maximize my profit at this stage. Holding out for more risks him walking away and accepting John's offer is no longer the optimal choice."
