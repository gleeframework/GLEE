{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum. This should give me room to negotiate while also incentivizing him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's worth trying to get a better price from him, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $7,800? I'm really interested in making a deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing a sale altogether.  John is a safe bet and I can guarantee myself a fair price."
