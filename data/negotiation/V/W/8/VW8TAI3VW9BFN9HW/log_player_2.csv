Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to accept $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,050,000, and it's her ""final offer"".  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so it's better to take that deal and save $50,000."
