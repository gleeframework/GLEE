"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but the price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to accept $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a great compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
