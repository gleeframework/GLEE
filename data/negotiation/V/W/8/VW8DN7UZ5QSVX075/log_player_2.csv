"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice further. You can potentially get a better price than $1,400,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's best to accept Alice's offer. You're getting a good deal at $1,350,000, which is closer to your budget than John's offer.  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away and you'll be stuck with John's price."
