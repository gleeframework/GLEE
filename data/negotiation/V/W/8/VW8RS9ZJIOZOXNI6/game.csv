"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but  $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,200? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,600, Bob. I think I can do better than that. How about we try $10,500? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
