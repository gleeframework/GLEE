Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,600, Bob. I think I can do better than that. How about we try $10,500? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Alice seems to be stuck at a price point that isn't beneficial to me. It's clear she won't go much lower than $10,500, and at this point, it's not worth the continued negotiation.  I'll get a fair deal from John and avoid further haggling."
