"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the current market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 falls short of what I believe is fair. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects my best effort to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move towards a compromise.  To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
