"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your perceived value and allows me a healthy profit. I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits us both. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $825,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground here.
