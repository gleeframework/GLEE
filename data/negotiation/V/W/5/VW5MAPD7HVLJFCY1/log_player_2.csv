Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  $100 is still too high for you, and you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer.  It's likely that Alice is willing to negotiate further, and this counteroffer demonstrates your seriousness in getting a good deal without immediately jumping to the $120 alternative."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above your target price of $120. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as you might be able to convince her to lower the price further. There are still 7 rounds remaining, so there's time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has moved a bit closer to your price. This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your last offer and Alice's latest one. It signals a commitment to reach a deal while still leaving room for further negotiation."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is now within your budget of $120 and is a better deal than buying from John.  While you could continue to negotiate and try for a lower price, the risk is that Alice might walk away or you might run out of rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product while still saving some money compared to buying from John."
