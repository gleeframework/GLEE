Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $15,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $20,000 is really the lowest I can go.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I understand the value of the product, but I am still unable to meet at $17,500. I would like to propose $16,000 as a compromise. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

```
At this point, Bob is unlikely to go higher and holding out for more might mean losing him as a buyer. $16,000 is a solid profit above my minimum.
