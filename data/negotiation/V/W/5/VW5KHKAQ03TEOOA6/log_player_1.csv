"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, it's still closer to my target price than selling to John. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but closer to my target price. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also demonstrates the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob. There are still 6 rounds left, and I want to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is my minimum price and I'm confident that Bob will accept it since it's still a good deal for him.  If he rejects, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but we only have 4 rounds left and there's no guarantee he'll accept my counteroffer. I'm going to sell the product to John. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than risking a lower price with Bob."
