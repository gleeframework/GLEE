"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant return on investment you can expect.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the product's value significantly exceeds that price point.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,025,000. This reflects a substantial discount on its true worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value here. To be straightforward, I need to stay above $950,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? This gets us very close while still acknowledging the product's worth.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to move up a little, how about $937,500?",937500.0,Bob,6,
