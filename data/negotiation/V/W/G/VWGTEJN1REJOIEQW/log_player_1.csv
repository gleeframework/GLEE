Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is a good business decision at this point.  Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's still substantially more than John's offer of $1,500,000, ensuring a healthy profit margin.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainties with further negotiation rounds. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting a reasonable counteroffer can foster goodwill for potential future deals with Bob."
