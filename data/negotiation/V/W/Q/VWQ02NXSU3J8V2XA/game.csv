"Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That price seems quite high to me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value.  To be fair, I could come down to $19,000. This is a very competitive price for what you're getting.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $19,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could we meet somewhere around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $16,000 for this.  That's already a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $16,000 is still pushing it for me.  I could potentially do $12,000. How does that sound?",12000.0,Bob,6,
