Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $22,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000} 
 
**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a price that's profitable. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer is high enough that Bob will likely counter. This gives you information about how badly he wants the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a backup buyer, so you're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. This gives you leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That price seems quite high to me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than both your minimum ($15,000) and your initial asking price. Accepting this would be a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a large gap between your offer and his, suggesting there's room to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Backup:** You still have John as a safety net, so there's no need to panic and accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value.  To be fair, I could come down to $19,000. This is a very competitive price for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 19000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease, but Above Minimum:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (""below value,"" ""competitive"") helps justify your position and makes it harder for Bob to counter with extremely low offers.
* **Continuing the Conversation:** The goal is to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground without conceding too much too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $19,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could we meet somewhere around $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer has increased, $10,000 is still significantly less than your $15,000 minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Bob's message suggests he might be willing to go a bit higher (""Could we meet *somewhere* around...""). Rejecting this offer encourages him to reveal his true limit.
* **John as Leverage:** The guaranteed $15,000 from John allows you to play hardball and aim for a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $16,000 for this.  That's already a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  This offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($19,000) and Bob's counter ($10,000), showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Close to Minimum, Highlighting Value:**  The price is just slightly above your absolute minimum, making it more tempting for Bob while still emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The phrase ""What do you say?"" aims to prompt a quicker decision from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but $16,000 is still pushing it for me.  I could potentially do $12,000. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Far Apart:** Bob's latest offer of $12,000 is still significantly below your $15,000 minimum.  The increments by which he's increasing his offers are getting smaller.
* **Unlikely to Reach Agreement:**  It's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to meet your minimum price. Continuing to negotiate will likely be a waste of time and effort.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000. It makes more sense to take the sure profit than to risk getting a lower price from Bob."
