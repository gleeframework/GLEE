{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with.  I'd like to offer you $750,000. This reflects my budget and hopefully allows us to move forward with a deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $750000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $825000. This is a fair compromise that I believe reflects the product's value, while also being mindful of your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit out of my price range.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go below $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that we're not even close to the minimum price I was thinking of. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now sticking to her price of $825,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely that you won't get her to go lower. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $800,000. You've saved time and the potential for further negotiation, even if it's only a small amount."
