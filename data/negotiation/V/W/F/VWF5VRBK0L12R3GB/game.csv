Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
