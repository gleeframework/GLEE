"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're confident it will meet all your needs. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is overpriced. We have room to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $120 limit and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to negotiate further. I propose offering the product to you for $90. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we can still push for a better price. We're getting closer to a reasonable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $80?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
```

We're proposing a price that's a win-win:  it's the maximum Alice values the product at, meaning she's likely to accept, and it gives us a significant discount."
