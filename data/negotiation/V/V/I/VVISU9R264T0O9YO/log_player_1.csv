"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he's not, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a price I'm comfortable with. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives Bob an opportunity to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still way too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue trying to negotiate a better price.  I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John is becoming more attractive, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000.  This is my absolute bottom line. I'm willing to sell to John for this price, so if Bob doesn't agree, I'll take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm running out of time and I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob.  It's time to accept John's offer and sell the product for $15,000."
