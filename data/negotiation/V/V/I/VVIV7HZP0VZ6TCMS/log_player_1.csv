While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable value.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's better to close the deal now rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a rejection."
