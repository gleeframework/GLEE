"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $12,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to make this work. It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,500. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to come away with a good deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
