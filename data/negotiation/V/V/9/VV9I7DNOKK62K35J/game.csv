"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still above my target.  To make this deal work, I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to me and the potential savings for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This price still represents a significant discount from the original value of the product to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the potential savings for me. I'm hopeful you'll consider this final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",825000.0,Alice,5,
