"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's below your maximum, you can likely get a better price. You have room to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still above my target.  To make this deal work, I'd be willing to pay $700,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This price still represents a significant discount from the original value of the product to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my target price, but $850,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to try and get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $825,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price, it's getting close.  Further negotiation might be possible, but I'm concerned that Alice might not budge further, and I risk losing the deal altogether. It's a good deal for me compared to buying from John, and I don't want to risk a stalemate."
