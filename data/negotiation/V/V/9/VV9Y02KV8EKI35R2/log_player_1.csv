I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We've been going back and forth for a while, and while I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,135,000 is a good deal. It's only $65,000 less than my initial offer, and it's a significant improvement over selling to John.  It's time to close the deal."
