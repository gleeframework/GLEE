"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first, though."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob is going to start with his maximum price point of $10,000. This makes it clear that he's serious about buying the product, but also sets the starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is closer to his maximum budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, as she might be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

Bob is going to offer $11,000. This is a compromise between his maximum price and Alice's last offer. He's showing a willingness to negotiate, but still aiming for a price that's within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice has come down to $11,500, but it's getting close to his maximum and he doesn't want to risk a longer negotiation that might end up with him paying even more.  It's better to take the guaranteed lower price from John."
