{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $20,000, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Emphasize Value:**  The message focuses on the potential value to Bob,  piquing his interest and encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for counteroffers, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

*  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worthwhile.
*  If his counteroffer is too low, I'll counter with a slightly lower price.
*  If he's unwilling to come closer to my desired price, I'll consider selling to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $18000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$18,000 is still too low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my initial offer.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** By rejecting and making a counteroffer, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while maintaining my desired profit margin. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counter-offer, likely somewhere between $18,000 and $20,000,  depending on how eager I am to sell to Bob.
* If he rejects again, I'll assess the situation and decide whether to accept his offer, make another counteroffer, or sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $18,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This reflects the unique value of this product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let's find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I reiterate the unique value of the product to emphasize its worth and justify the price.
* **Maintain Optimism:** The message ends on a positive note, expressing a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer,  considering factors like his counteroffer (if any) and his negotiation style. 
* **Prepare for Next Steps:**  Based on Bob's response, I'll be ready to either accept his offer, make another counteroffer, or finalize the deal with John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $19000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $17500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $17,500 is getting close to my minimum of $15,000. However, I still want to try and secure a better price.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for a higher offer from Bob.  He's shown interest and is willing to negotiate.
* **Risk of Losing to John:** I'm aware that selling to John is a guaranteed $15,000, but I'm willing to take the risk of another round of negotiation to potentially get a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I will make a counteroffer, likely around $18,000, to see if I can bridge the gap between our offers.
* **Decision Point:**  If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John.  I'm running out of bargaining room, but I'm hoping to avoid selling for the minimum price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm  really trying to work with you here. While $17,500 is below what I hoped for, I'm willing to make a final concession.  How about we settle at $18,000?
