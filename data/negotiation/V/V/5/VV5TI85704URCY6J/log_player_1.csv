Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $149. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, starting high is advantageous.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to go a bit higher. Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Psychology:** A price of $149 seems like a ""deal"" compared to a flat $150, potentially making Bob more receptive."
