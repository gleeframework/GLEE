Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While $920,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but $920,000 still doesn't quite work for me. Would you be willing to go up to $940,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 940000}

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiation isn't progressing quickly enough. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk of not closing the deal is too high. Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option that ensures I don't walk away empty-handed."
