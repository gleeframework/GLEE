"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a better price than John's $120, Bob can likely do better.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $105 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $115, and it's still a decent profit for Alice considering her valuation of $100.  This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of securing a deal at a price closer to Bob's ideal target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, and $110 is a good price for Bob. It's lower than John's price and still gives him a decent deal. Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it's also a risk that could lead to a higher price or losing the deal altogether. Accepting Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise."
