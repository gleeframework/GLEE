Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $99. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we could offer the product at $100 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $99 is just above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still feels like a ""deal"" compared to a flat $100.
* **Alternative Option:**  By having John as a backup buyer, we're not pressured to accept anything below our minimum. This gives us leverage in negotiations."
