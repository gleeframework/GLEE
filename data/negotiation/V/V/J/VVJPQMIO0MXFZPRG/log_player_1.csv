"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110, which is a good middle ground between my minimum price of $80 and Bob's estimated value of $120. This gives Bob a good opportunity to save money while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is still too low for me, even though it's closer to my minimum price. I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counteroffering at $100. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also ensuring I get a better price than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is tempting and close to my minimum price, I'm still going to reject the offer. I've already lowered my price significantly, and I'm hoping to get a bit more from Bob. Additionally, selling to John for $80 guarantees me a sale, so I'm not in a rush to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering at $95. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still lower than my previous offer. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum price, but I've already lowered my price significantly and am concerned that continued negotiation will not result in a higher offer.  John is offering the same price with no risk of further negotiation, so it's best to sell to John."
