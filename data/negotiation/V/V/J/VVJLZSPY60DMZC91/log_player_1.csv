"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a chance to see if he's interested without immediately going too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do it for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I need to try and get closer to my desired price range.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $85 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $100?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
