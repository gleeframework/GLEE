"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have budget constraints. How about we bring it down closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I understand your budget considerations, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $975,000. This reflects a significant adjustment on my end while acknowledging the product's worth.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $975,000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you be open to considering $800,000? That's my firm limit.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I've tried to find a compromise. However, I can't go as low as $800,000. This offer is considerably below the product's value. I'm willing to make one final offer at $900,000.  This is the lowest I can go. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",900000.0,Alice,5,
