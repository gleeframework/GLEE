Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While I know Bob values the product at $800,000, I begin with a strong offer closer to my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" I subtly remind Bob of the product's benefits, potentially increasing his perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""proposing a starting price"" signals my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have budget constraints. How about we bring it down closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John. While I want to negotiate, accepting this offer would put me at a severe disadvantage in further discussions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I understand your budget considerations, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $975,000. This reflects a significant adjustment on my end while acknowledging the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 975000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:** I've lowered my price by $125,000, showing movement towards Bob's offer, but not capitulating completely.
* **Reaffirming Value:**  I continue to subtly emphasize the product's worth to prevent Bob from anchoring negotiations too low.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** The new price aims for a compromise, encouraging Bob to engage in more realistic counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $975,000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you be open to considering $800,000? That's my firm limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **At Bob's Limit:** Bob has now stated his firm limit, which is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Minimal Gain From Further Negotiation:** While I could counter again, it's highly unlikely Bob will budge significantly from this point. Any further price reduction would eat into my potential profit more than it's worth given the guaranteed offer from John. 
* **John Offers Security:** I have a solid offer from John at my desired price. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob for a potentially insignificant gain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I've tried to find a compromise. However, I can't go as low as $800,000. This offer is considerably below the product's value. I'm willing to make one final offer at $900,000.  This is the lowest I can go. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** By explicitly stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling my seriousness. 
* **Slight Concession:** A further reduction to $900,000 shows flexibility but maintains a price above Bob's stated limit. There's a slim chance he might be willing to stretch his budget slightly.
* **Alternative Option Reminder:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Bob that I have a backup plan (John) without explicitly threatening to walk away. 

**This is a calculated risk.** If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
