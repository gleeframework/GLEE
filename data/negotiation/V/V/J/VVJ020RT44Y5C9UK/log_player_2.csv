"Alice's offer:

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I've tried to find a compromise. However, I can't go as low as $800,000. This offer is considerably below the product's value. I'm willing to make one final offer at $900,000.  This is the lowest I can go. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer and she's unwilling to meet your $800,000 limit.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a price you're happy with. You have a guaranteed option with John at your maximum price, so it makes the most sense to take that deal."
