"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's below its market value. If you're not interested, I'm confident I can find another buyer who will happily pay the full $1,000,000.  Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
