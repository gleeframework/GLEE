"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's below its market value. If you're not interested, I'm confident I can find another buyer who will happily pay the full $1,000,000.  Please let me know your decision.",900000.0,Alice,1,
