Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $11500 for the product. This price is still a fair value for both of us, and it's within my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The goal is to maximize profit. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a lower price than selling to John.  It's better to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a great price for a product worth $12,000 to you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is my absolute limit. Let's close this deal, it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $12,000 is the same as what John is offering.  It's best to accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal."
