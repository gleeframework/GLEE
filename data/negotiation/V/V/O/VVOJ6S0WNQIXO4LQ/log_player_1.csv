Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. 
* This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($10,000) but lower than what I can get from John ($15,000).
* This strategy maximizes my chances of selling to Bob while still securing a decent profit. If Bob rejects, I can always sell to John and earn a higher price."
