"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll be impressed with it.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```
Alice's starting offer is much higher than both your budget and the product's value to you. It's highly unlikely she'll accept an offer near your desired price right away, so you need to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down to $600,000? If that works for you, I'm ready to move forward."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

This counteroffer is a starting point to gauge Alice's negotiating stance.  We're aiming low to leave room for negotiation while still staying within a reasonable range of our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 is significantly below the value this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice lowered her price, but it's still considerably more than your budget and John's offer.  It's time to negotiate further and see if you can reach a more agreeable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while working within my budget."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

We're inching closer to our goal while signaling that we're serious about the purchase. This counteroffer offers a substantial increase from our last while still leaving room for some final negotiation."
