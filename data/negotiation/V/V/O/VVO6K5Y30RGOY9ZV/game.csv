"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll be impressed with it.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down to $600,000? If that works for you, I'm ready to move forward.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 is significantly below the value this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while working within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
