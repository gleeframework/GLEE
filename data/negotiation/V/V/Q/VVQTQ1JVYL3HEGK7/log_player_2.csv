# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think you'll find very reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $8,500? It's a bit closer to my minimum price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500. Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John."
