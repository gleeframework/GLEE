"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $8,500? It's a bit closer to my minimum price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
