"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,600,000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth at least that to you.  If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice is trying to bluff you into overpaying. You know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer."
