"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a great value for the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Emphasis on value:**  The message highlights the product's uniqueness and value, hoping to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message clearly indicates that I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts, setting the stage for a potential counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* **Initial high price:**  This allows me to potentially secure a higher price, while also providing a cushion for future negotiations.
* **Monitoring Bob's response:**  This will help me gauge his interest and adjust my strategy for subsequent rounds.
* **The ""John"" option:** This is my safety net to ensure a minimum profit, so I won't be forced to accept unfavorable deals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk that Bob might become less interested or might not budge further.
* **Time constraint:**  I have only 10 rounds, so I don't want to waste time on a protracted negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome.

**Strategy:**

* **Secure the guaranteed profit:** By accepting Bob's offer, I secure my minimum desired profit and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation.
* **Minimize risk:**  This decision minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower price or not closing a deal within the allotted rounds."
