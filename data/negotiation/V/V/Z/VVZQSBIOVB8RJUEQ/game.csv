"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its worth to me is capped at $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit, and I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product. How about $1,280,000? This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",1280000.0,Alice,5,
