"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
