"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are aiming for a price under $800,000, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm counteroffering $900000 for the product. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is closer to your ideal price, it's still above your target of $800,000. You have a few rounds left, and there's a chance you can negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $750,000, which is a fair price given the product's value to me.  This offer is a good deal for both of us and will allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering $850000 for the product. I believe this price is getting closer to the value I have in mind, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is very close to your target price of $800,000, but you can still try to negotiate a better price. You have several rounds remaining, and there's a good chance you can get Alice to lower her price by a few thousand dollars.  It's worth it to try to get the best deal possible before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $850,000.  That's getting close to my budget, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly.  I'm confident that this is a good deal for you, and I'm ready to close the transaction."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $825000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering $875000 for the product. I believe this price is getting closer to the value I have in mind, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm getting close to my minimum price, so I hope we can come to an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $875,000 is close to your target, you only have three rounds left. The risk of further negotiation could lead to Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from John at a lower price. You've been able to secure a price from John for $800,000, which is a better deal than what you could potentially get with Alice. It's better to take the guaranteed lower price from John at this point."
