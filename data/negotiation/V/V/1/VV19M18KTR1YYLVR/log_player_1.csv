Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob is savvy enough to recognize the value. He saves $100,000 compared to its actual worth to him, and we secure a profit beyond our guaranteed sale. 
* **Alternative Secured:**  If Bob rejects the offer, we haven't lost anything. We can proceed confidently to John, knowing our minimum acceptable price is met."
