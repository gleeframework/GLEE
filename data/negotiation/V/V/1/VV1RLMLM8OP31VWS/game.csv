"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. That said, $110 is still a little more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 was still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $90, which would be $100. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.",100.0,Alice,5,
