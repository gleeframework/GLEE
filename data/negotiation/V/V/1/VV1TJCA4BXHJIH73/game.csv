"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $98. Let's try to close this deal.  It's a fair price for both of us.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, $98 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $98. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement.  I'm going to have to stick to $95. It's the lowest I can go while still making a reasonable profit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",95.0,Alice,7,
