"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,250,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great price for the value this product offers. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budgetary limitations, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I am still not able to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is the highest amount I can realistically allocate towards this purchase. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept. To bridge the gap and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value this product brings. I hope we can finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
