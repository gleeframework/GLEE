Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept. To bridge the gap and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value this product brings. I hope we can finalize this deal.
