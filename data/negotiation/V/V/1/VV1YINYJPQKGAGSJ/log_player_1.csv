Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm offering it to you at a special price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, selling to Bob at a higher price will net you a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win situation:
    *  You earn a significant amount more than your minimum acceptable price.
    *  Bob gets a $50,000 discount, making the deal attractive compared to its value to him. 
* **Urgency:**  Adding a  ""limited-time"" element encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your offer rather than risk losing out on the deal."
