,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $13,500. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'll meet you at $12,500. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",11750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $12,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for the value the product brings to you.",12200.0,Alice,7,
