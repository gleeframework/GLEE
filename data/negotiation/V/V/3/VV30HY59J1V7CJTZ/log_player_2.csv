"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet your needs. This product holds significant value to us, but we understand its importance to you is equally high. We're offering it to you at a special price of $12,000, which we believe is a fair compromise considering its worth to both parties. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own something truly exceptional. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to secure a better deal."
