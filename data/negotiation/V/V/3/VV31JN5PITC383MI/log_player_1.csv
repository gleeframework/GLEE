Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'll see how Bob reacts to this offer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I understand his offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept,  I believe I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,750,000. This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway while still ensuring I get a significant profit over my minimum value. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer of $1,600,000 is a good deal considering that John is only offering $1,500,000.  It's important to be realistic and secure a profit rather than risk losing a sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
