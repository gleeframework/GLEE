"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This would be a great deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
