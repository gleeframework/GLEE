Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how Alice should approach this offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice needs at least $1,200,000 (her fallback offer from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000) to be made.

**The Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases the likelihood of acceptance.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Why this works:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starts negotiations close to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's worth, making the price seem more reasonable.
* **""Fair Deal"" Language:** Creates a sense of balance and encourages agreement. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is strong, there's a slight buffer for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, Alice has a strong backup plan with John's guaranteed purchase."
