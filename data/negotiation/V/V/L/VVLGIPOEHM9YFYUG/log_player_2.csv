``` 

**Explanation:**

* Buying from Alice for $12,000 saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Although the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, your goal is to minimize your cost, not to negotiate the lowest price for Alice. 
* Accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it achieves both your goals: acquiring the product and saving money."
