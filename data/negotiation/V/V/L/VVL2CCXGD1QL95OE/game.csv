"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to work with you to find a middle ground. After considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make a new counteroffer of $850,000. I think this is the closest we can get to a mutually beneficial agreement, and I'm willing to work with you to finalize the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
