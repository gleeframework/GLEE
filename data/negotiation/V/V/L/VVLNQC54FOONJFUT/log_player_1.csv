Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below our minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $125 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and we can always come down a little while still staying above our minimum.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning listing it publicly implies someone else might snatch it up, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy balances getting the best price from Bob with the security of knowing John will buy it for our minimum acceptable price if needed."
