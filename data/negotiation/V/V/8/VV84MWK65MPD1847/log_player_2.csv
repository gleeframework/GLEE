"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's a clear indication that we need to negotiate to get closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for presenting the product. While I recognize its value, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my actual budget ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. This allows Alice to counteroffer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is courteous but clearly states that $20,000 is unrealistic. I'm showing serious interest by making a counteroffer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give me a better understanding of Alice's flexibility and how low she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $6,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider something closer to $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice came down, but $17,000 is still way above my budget and even further from my initial counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Her counteroffer shows she's willing to negotiate, but there's a large gap to bridge. 
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:**  I'll need to counter with a more reasonable offer to keep the negotiation moving and avoid reaching a stalemate.  I'm willing to go higher, but I need to see more flexibility on her side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $7,000? I feel that's a fair offer, considering my budget."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer, but Below Budget:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by significantly increasing my offer to $7,000, which is still below my maximum budget.
* **Budget Transparency:** I'm explicitly mentioning my budget to signal that there's limited room for me to move much higher. This hopefully encourages Alice to be more realistic.
* **Seeking a Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a price that's closer to the middle ground between our previous offers, demonstrating a genuine attempt to find an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I have another offer on the table for closer to my asking price. However, I value your interest and am willing to come down to $14,000 as a final offer.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by presenting a ""final offer"" and mentioning another potential buyer. This is likely designed to create a sense of urgency.
* **Still Too Far Apart:**  While $14,000 is the lowest price Alice has offered, it's still considerably higher than my $8,000 limit and significantly above my last offer of $7,000. 
* **John's Price is Guaranteed:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of a stalemate. John's guaranteed price of $8,000 ensures I can get the product within my budget.

**It's time to walk away from Alice's offer and purchase from John.**"
