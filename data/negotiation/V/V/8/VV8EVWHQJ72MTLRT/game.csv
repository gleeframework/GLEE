"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
