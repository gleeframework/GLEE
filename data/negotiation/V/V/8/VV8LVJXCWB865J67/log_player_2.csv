Round 7

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I've reached a point where I'm not confident we'll be able to reach an agreement within my budget. It's more beneficial to purchase the product from John at $10,000, ensuring I secure the product at my desired price. Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of running out of rounds and ending up with no product, or having to pay more than I'm comfortable with."
