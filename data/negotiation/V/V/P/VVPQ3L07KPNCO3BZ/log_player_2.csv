"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you value greatly. Given its unique nature and your specific interest, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and John is offering it for that price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to get the product for a better price from John."
