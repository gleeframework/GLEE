Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a price that is higher than my minimum value of $120 but still leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth $150 to him. I believe this is a good starting point to maximize my profit while still potentially securing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum value of $120, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $135. This is a compromise between his offer of $130 and my desired price of $140. I believe this price is fair and offers both of us a good outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $128 is still lower than what I initially aimed for, it's only slightly below my minimum value of $120.  Considering the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob rejecting my counteroffer, it's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure a sale."
