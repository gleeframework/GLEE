"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  I believe this price reflects the value it brings to me while allowing for a fair profit for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $850,000, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. I'm confident we can find common ground at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering it to you for $920,000. This is as close as I can get to your offer without compromising my own value. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
