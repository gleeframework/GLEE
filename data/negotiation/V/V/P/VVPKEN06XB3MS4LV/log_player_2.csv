"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $150.** You're looking to save money, and accepting this offer would mean paying more than you're comfortable with.
* **You have the option to counteroffer and potentially get a better price.**  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to negotiate and see if you can find a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  $110 is less than your maximum price of $150.
* **You've already rejected one offer and negotiated.**  While you might be able to negotiate further, it's possible Alice won't budge much more. 
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  It's in your best interest to accept this offer and save money compared to buying from John."
