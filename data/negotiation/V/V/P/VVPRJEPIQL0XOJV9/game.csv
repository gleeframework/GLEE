"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $10,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you be willing to consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from the original price of $10,000.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $8,750? That's a fair compromise, I think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum price. I'm thinking of $9,000, which is a bit lower than my previous offer, but still a good price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. $9,000 is getting closer, but to be honest, I can't go any higher than $8,800. That's my final offer. Let me know if that works for you.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. I'm thinking of $9,200, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $9,000. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,7,
