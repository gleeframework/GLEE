"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to pay $750000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a little too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $825000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
