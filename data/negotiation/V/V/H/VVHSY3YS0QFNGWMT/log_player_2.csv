"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her $80 value. If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $150."
