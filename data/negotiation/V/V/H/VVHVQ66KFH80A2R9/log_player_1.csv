Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit if he accepts.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a substantial profit margin above Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Observing Bob's reaction to this initial offer will provide valuable information for potential negotiation and price adjustments."
