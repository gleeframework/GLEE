"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your asking price.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $1,325,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.  Let's try to make this happen.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
