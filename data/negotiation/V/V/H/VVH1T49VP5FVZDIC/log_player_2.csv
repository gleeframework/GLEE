"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting allows you to start negotiating and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $115 is still too low. I'm willing to go down to $125, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still above my maximum budget of $100.  I've already made several counteroffers and we're not getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with.  It's better to buy from John at this point to save time and ensure I get the product at a price I can afford."
