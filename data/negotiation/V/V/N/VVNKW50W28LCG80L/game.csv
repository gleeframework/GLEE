"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $125 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $105?  It's still a good price for you and closer to what I can afford.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to be fair.  $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. That's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
