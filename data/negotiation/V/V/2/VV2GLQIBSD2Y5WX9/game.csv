"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth more than $800,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning it.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering my needs, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can shake hands on this.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to accept $900,000. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $925,000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
