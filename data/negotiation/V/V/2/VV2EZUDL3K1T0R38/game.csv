"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  My asking price is $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its worth.  I understand you have a strong interest in this product and I am confident it will exceed your expectations. If you're not interested at this price, I have another buyer lined up, but I would prefer to work with you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
