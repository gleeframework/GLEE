{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $135 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I can likely get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $125 is closer to what I'd like, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'd be willing to do $130 for the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $127 for it. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $127 is close to my minimum and it's likely I won't be able to get much more. Accepting his offer is the best option for maximizing my profit in this scenario."
