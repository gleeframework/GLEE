Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants a lower price. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximizing potential profit:** By starting high, you increase the potential for a higher sale price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This allows for a back-and-forth, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Protecting your minimum value:** You've set a clear floor for your price, ensuring you don't settle for less than what you're comfortable with.

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's reaction and the progression of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your initial offer.  You should reject his offer and try to get closer to your desired price point. By rejecting, you signal that you're willing to negotiate but not settle for significantly less than your original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

This counteroffer represents a compromise. It's lower than your initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows you're willing to negotiate but also that you value your product. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing interests:**  The $925,000 price point is a middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Maintaining momentum:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation active.
* **Avoiding a potential deadlock:**  Offering a slightly lower price increases the likelihood of Bob accepting.

You're aiming to find a price that's mutually agreeable, maximizing your profit while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a critical decision point.  Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best choice:

* **Close to your minimum:**  $875,000 is significantly closer to your minimum acceptable price of $800,000 than your initial asking price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to further concessions on your part, potentially lowering the price even further.
* **Potential for deadlock:** If you reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he might walk away from the deal entirely.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling for $875,000 guarantees you a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.

While you'd ideally prefer to sell for closer to your initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic and risk-averse choice at this stage."
