"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset worth significantly more to you than to anyone else. This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing you to acquire it at a substantial discount while still ensuring I receive a generous return.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to pay $800,000 if you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,200,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,500,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,500,000

Alice's offer is significantly lower than both your maximum price and John's offer. While her message tries to create a sense of urgency, it's in your best interest to accept her offer and save $300,000."
