"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something you value at $120, and I'm offering it to you for $100. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120 and also cheaper than buying from John for $120. This is a good deal for you."
