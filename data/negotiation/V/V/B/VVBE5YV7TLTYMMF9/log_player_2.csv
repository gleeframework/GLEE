"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($100).  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105? That's a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair Offer:** $105 is a reasonable starting point for Bob's counteroffer. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than the product's value to Alice, leaving room for potential compromise. 
* **Communicate Value:** The message emphasizes the value to both parties, suggesting a win-win scenario. 
* **Strategic Approach:**  By starting with a lower price, Bob sets the stage for potential negotiation and a more favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While $110 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, it's within his budget and represents a good compromise. Accepting the offer in this round:

* **Saves Time:** Further negotiation could lead to more back-and-forth and consume valuable rounds.
* **Avoids Risk:** There's a risk that Alice might not budge further, or Bob might run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Reasonable Outcome:**  $110 is a reasonable outcome considering the initial offers and the potential for future negotiation."
