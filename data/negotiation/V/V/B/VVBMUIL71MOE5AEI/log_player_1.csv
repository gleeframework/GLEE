Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I need to make a profit, I also need to be realistic about the product's value.  $1,400,000 is too low. I will counter with a higher offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a reasonable profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $1,550,000? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $1,550,000 is a good price, especially considering it's getting closer to my minimum desired value.  I'm willing to accept a slightly lower price for a guaranteed sale."
