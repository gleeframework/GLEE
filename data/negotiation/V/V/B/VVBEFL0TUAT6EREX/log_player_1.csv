Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 2200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,200,000, you are setting a high ""anchor"" price. While Bob knows his valuation is lower, this high starting point might make him perceive subsequent offers as more reasonable.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives you a strong position.  You're not desperate to accept any offer below that.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Pay close attention to Bob's response. A low counteroffer could indicate a significant gap in your perceptions of value.  
* **Negotiation Pace:**  Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on how Bob engages. If he seems hesitant or the negotiation stalls, moving closer to the $1,500,000 mark (while still aiming higher) might be necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:**  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly above his perceived value of $800,000. This suggests he's willing to go higher.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a substantial gap between his offer and your minimum ($1,500,000). Rejecting this offer allows you to counter and explore that space.
* **John as Leverage:** You're not pressured to accept anything below $1,500,000. This knowledge gives you the confidence to push for a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial proposal reflects.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** This counteroffer shows flexibility by lowering the price by $300,000. This is a substantial concession that might encourage Bob.
* **Above Your Minimum:**  It's crucial to stay above your $1,500,000 minimum to ensure a profit, even if it means potentially losing Bob's business.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further. His response will give you valuable information about his true interest and potential to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 exceeds your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, securing a profit.
* **Strong Negotiation by Bob:** Bob has consistently increased his offer and is now in a strong bargaining position.  
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Pushing further risks alienating Bob. He might walk away, leaving you to sell to John at your minimum. It's often better to accept a good offer than risk losing it for a slightly better one."
