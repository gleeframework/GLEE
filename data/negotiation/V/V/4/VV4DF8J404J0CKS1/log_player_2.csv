"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is well above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my best offer, as it's the maximum I can afford."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $12,500 is still above my budget. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my target price of $10,000 by continuing the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $11,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept that price. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $11,750. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value you place on the product as well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $11,750, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my target of $10,000.  I'm hoping to see if Alice will budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,750 is still a little higher than I can comfortably go. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $11,250 for the product.  This would allow us both to walk away with a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept $11,250. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value I place on the product. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still too high for me.  I've already spent several rounds trying to negotiate a lower price, but it seems she's unwilling to go lower. It's clear that we won't be able to reach an agreement within my budget.  At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for $10,000 to avoid further negotiations that are unlikely to be fruitful."
