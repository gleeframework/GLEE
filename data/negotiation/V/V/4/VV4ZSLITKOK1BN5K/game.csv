"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,250. This is a fair price that's within my budget and hopefully still attractive to you. What do you think?",12250.0,Bob,4,
