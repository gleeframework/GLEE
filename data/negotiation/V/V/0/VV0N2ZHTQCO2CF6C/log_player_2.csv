"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can get the product for less than $11,000 from her, and save even more money."

# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $10,500, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $10,700. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?
