Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, demonstrating that he is willing to compromise and make a deal.  This offer is closer to Alice's previous offer, but still below her current price. This is a calculated risk as it's getting close to Bob's maximum acceptable price, but it's also a move to signal his willingness to meet halfway. With only a few rounds left, Bob needs to show he's serious about getting the deal done."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, the offer is still too high, and Bob is willing to take a chance on the next round. He has a few rounds left and wants to continue trying to get a better deal. However, if the next offer isn't better, he'll likely consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his maximum acceptable price. This is a calculated risk, as Alice might reject this offer. However, it's a strong offer that demonstrates Bob's seriousness about closing the deal while also leaving a little wiggle room. If Alice rejects, Bob will likely be forced to buy from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call for Bob, as Alice is getting closer to his maximum acceptable price. However, with only one round remaining and Alice having rejected all his counteroffers, it's likely she won't budge further.  It's a better strategy for Bob to buy from John for $10,000 to ensure he gets the product.  

While he doesn't get the absolute best price, he still gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
