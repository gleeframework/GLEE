"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but I'd need to see that price to make it work. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9000, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to make this happen.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from the $9500 mark. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10250. It's a fair price that should make us both happy. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10250 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $9500.  It's a fair price that allows you to make a profit and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen!",9500.0,Bob,6,
