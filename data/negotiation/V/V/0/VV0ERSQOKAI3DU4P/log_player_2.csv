Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for less than $10,000 from Alice, and he's willing to pay up to $12,000. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still willing to pay more than Alice's minimum, but $10,500 is too high. He should counteroffer again and see if he can get closer to his target price."
