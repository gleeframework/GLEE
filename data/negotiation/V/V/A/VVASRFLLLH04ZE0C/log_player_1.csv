"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I can likely still get a better price.  I need to find a middle ground between his offer and my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is significantly lower than what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, however, and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise given the value you've outlined."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $1100000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob hasn't budged from his previous offer, I'm still hesitant to sell for $1,050,000. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000.  This is my final offer before I explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $1075000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been insistent on his price of $1,050,000, and there's little indication he's willing to budge further. While this is only the sixth round, and I have four more to negotiate, the risk of not securing a sale is increasing.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is still significantly more than my minimum. It's a safer bet to take the deal with John rather than risking a failed negotiation with Bob and potentially losing out on any sale."
