"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product from John for $150, and Alice's offer is $140. You are willing to pay up to $150, so rejecting Alice's offer makes sense. You might be able to negotiate with Alice further to get a lower price, but there's no guarantee."
