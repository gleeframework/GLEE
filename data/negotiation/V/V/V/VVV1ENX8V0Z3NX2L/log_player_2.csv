"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price. You can always buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say around $1,700,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,700,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice, as there's still room to find a price we both can agree on."
