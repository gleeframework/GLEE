"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say around $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable paying $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
