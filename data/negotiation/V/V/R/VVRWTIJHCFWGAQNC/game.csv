"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $18,500?",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. How about we split the difference at $16,750?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",16750.0,Bob,4,
