"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,000,000.  This is my best offer and represents a considerable reduction.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, there's still a significant gap between our positions. To bridge that, I'd be willing to offer $750,000. This represents a serious investment on my end and acknowledges the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions remains substantial.  My final offer is $950,000.  This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value this product holds. Let me know your decision, as I need to explore other options if we can't reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concessions you've made. To be completely transparent, I have another option available at a lower price. However, I believe in being fair and recognize the value of your product.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 as my final counteroffer. This represents a significant investment for me but also acknowledges the worth of what you're offering.",800000.0,Bob,6,
