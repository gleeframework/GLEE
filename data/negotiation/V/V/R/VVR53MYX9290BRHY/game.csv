"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?  This price still gives you a great value, and I think it's fair for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm happy to purchase from John for that price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
