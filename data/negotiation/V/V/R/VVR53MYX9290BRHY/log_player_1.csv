Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While I'm eager to sell, $9,000 is too low for me.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?  This price still gives you a great value, and I think it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm happy to purchase from John for that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred a higher price, $10,000 is a fair deal and avoids the risk of him buying from John."
