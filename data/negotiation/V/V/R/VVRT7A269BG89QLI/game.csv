"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way more than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $140 is still more than I can do.  Would you consider $100?  That's a pretty significant increase from my last offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price, but I can't go as low as $100.  Perhaps we could settle on $125? That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting very close! I can do $120, but that's really the absolute most I can spend. It's a great product, and I'd love to make this work.",120.0,Bob,6,
