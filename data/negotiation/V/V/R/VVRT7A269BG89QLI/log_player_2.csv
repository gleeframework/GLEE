"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a starting price of $200. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate and see if she'll come down significantly, rather than accepting such an inflated price.  I'm willing to walk away and buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way more than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my $120 maximum. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling I'm serious about a much lower price.
* **Polite and Direct:**  Maintaining a good rapport is important in negotiations. I'm acknowledging her offer while being clear about my budget limitations.

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but $140 is still too high for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to get her closer to my range. Buying from John for $120 is looking more and more appealing if we can't find a compromise soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $140 is still more than I can do.  Would you consider $100?  That's a pretty significant increase from my last offer."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:**  I'm increasing my offer, but not by a huge amount. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also sticking to a reasonable budget.
* **Highlighting the Increase:**  By emphasizing the size of my counter, I'm hoping to encourage Alice to make a similar move towards a compromise.

We're getting closer to the later rounds, so the pressure is on!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price, but I can't go as low as $100.  Perhaps we could settle on $125? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting very close to my limit, but I'm still willing to push a little further. Her saying ""$125 is my final offer"" could be a negotiation tactic, so I'll try one more time to get her down to $120. If she doesn't budge, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting very close! I can do $120, but that's really the absolute most I can spend. It's a great product, and I'd love to make this work."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my maximum budget.  I'm being firm but polite, letting Alice know this is as high as I can go.
* **Appeal to Agreement:** I'm emphasizing that I want the deal to work, hoping she'll see this as a fair offer and agree. 

If Alice rejects this, it's time to walk away and buy from John.  I'm not going to pay more than my limit."
