"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1400000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to pay $1400000, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1300000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and your willingness to pay a premium for it.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
