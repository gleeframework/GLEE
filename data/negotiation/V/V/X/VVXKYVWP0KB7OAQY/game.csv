"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $140?  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $140 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $155.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets me stay within my budget.  What do you think?",155.0,Bob,4,
