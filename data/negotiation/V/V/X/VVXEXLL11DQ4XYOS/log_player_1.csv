{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts at a high point, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also provides a reason for the price and is friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.** 
* **I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay $8,000.**  This gives me leverage in the negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a more favorable price.** I can try to meet in the middle or explore a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice! I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.** I'm not going to lose money on this deal.
* **Selling to Bob for $8,000 is the same as selling to John.** I'm not gaining any additional profit by waiting for another counteroffer.
* **It's more efficient to accept the offer and close the deal.** Further negotiation might just delay the sale."
