Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
