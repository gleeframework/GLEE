"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we settle at $900,000? I think that's a fair reflection of its value.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
