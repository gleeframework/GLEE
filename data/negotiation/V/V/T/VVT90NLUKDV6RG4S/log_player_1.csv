Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we start with a price higher than his perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows us to secure a price closer to our minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and our willingness to offer a deal before going public, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** If Bob rejects this offer, we still have the safety net of John who will buy it at our desired minimum price of $15,000.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while considering the information we have about Bob's valuation."
