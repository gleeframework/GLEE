"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,500. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
