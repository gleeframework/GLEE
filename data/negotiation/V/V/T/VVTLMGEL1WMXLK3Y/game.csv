,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $120. Would you be willing to accept that price?",120.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $120. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $127. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",127.0,Alice,5,
