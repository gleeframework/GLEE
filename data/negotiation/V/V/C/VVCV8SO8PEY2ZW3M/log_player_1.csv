"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Not Too High:**  $17,500 is still within a reasonable range, considering my minimum acceptable price is $15,000. 
* **Positive Message:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, which is indicated by the message. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation strong while keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $17500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I can still get a better price from Bob. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:** While $15,000 is a good price, I want to see if I can get more from Bob before committing to John. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the potential for a better deal while also keeping John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. I'll counter with $14,500. This reflects the product's value and leaves room for a fair agreement. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while maintaining my negotiating stance.
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by highlighting the product's value. 
* **Positive tone:**  Using phrases like ""fair agreement"" and ""close this deal"" keeps the negotiation friendly and encourages a quick resolution.
* **Realistic expectation:**  $14,500 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my initial offer, allowing room for further negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, encouraging Bob to accept while still leaving room for a potential higher price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but $14500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $13500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for higher price:** Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, and there's still room for a better offer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I can't reach a satisfactory price with Bob, I can always sell to John.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and aim for a price closer to my desired value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $14,000,  which reflects the product's value while allowing for a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by reducing my price slightly, but not drastically.
* **Fairness Focus:** I reiterate the concept of a ""fair compromise"" to keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Value Justification:** I'm still connecting my offer to the product's value, reminding Bob of its worth.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $13200 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value and the negotiations so far.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $13,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, there's still room for a slightly higher price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to try to reach a more favorable price while knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the negotiations. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer the product for $13,800.  This is a fair price considering the value we've discussed and reflects my desire to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but not quite there yet.
* **Desire to Close:** I emphasize my desire to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Fairness Focus:** I again highlight the fairness of my offer to keep the negotiation amicable. 

This counteroffer aims to close the gap with Bob's offer while still securing a price that's closer to my target. It also creates a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13800 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $13000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value and the negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the end of our 10 rounds. 
* **Bob's offers are stubbornly low:**  $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiations with Bob. 

While I'd prefer a higher price,  time constraints and the risk of Bob's continued lowball offers make selling to John the most logical choice."
