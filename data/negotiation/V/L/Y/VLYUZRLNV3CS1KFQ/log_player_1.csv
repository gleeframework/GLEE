I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer him again. While $1,025,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I have a few more rounds to work with before I need to consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Let's aim for a win-win.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  It's a fair price for a product that's worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target price, I've already rejected Bob's offer twice.  There are only 4 rounds left before I have to sell to John.  At $1,030,000, I'm still getting a good price for the product, and it's better than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  Let's accept and move on."
