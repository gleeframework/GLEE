"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. I'm interested, but I'm going to need to see a lower price to make this work for me.  I'm willing to pay $6,500 for the product."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $6,900? It's a compromise that I think would benefit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $6,900 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still aiming for a lower price. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $6,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my offer of $6,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $6,750? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$6,750 is a great price for me.  It's closer to my desired price point and a good compromise. While I could continue to negotiate, I don't want to risk Alice getting frustrated and walking away from the deal. It's also better than buying from John for $8,000."
