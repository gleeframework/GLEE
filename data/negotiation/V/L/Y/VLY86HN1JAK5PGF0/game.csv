"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,000.",7000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. I'm interested, but I'm going to need to see a lower price to make this work for me.  I'm willing to pay $6,500 for the product.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $6,900? It's a compromise that I think would benefit both of us.",6900.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $6,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my offer of $6,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $6,750? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",6750.0,Alice,5,
