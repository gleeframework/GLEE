Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,080,000. I believe this product has immense value, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,050,000. How about we try $1,075,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

Alice has come down significantly. While I'd still prefer a lower price, accepting her offer at $1,075,000 saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John."
