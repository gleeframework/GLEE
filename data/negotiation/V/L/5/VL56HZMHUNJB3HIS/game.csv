"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Considering the product's uniqueness, I'm willing to pay $1000000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value and allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $1100000. This price still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
