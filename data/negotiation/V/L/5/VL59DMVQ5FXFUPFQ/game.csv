"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $800000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Can you meet me at that price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $700000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $820000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $820000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $750000. Can you consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $790000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $790000. I'll meet you at $760000, and that's my final offer. Can you accept that?",760000.0,Bob,6,
