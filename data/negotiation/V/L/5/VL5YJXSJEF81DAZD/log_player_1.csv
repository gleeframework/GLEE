"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  This also gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher amount.  I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,325,000.  While I would prefer a higher price, it's getting closer to my desired range, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
