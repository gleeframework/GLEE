"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a bold move, but it's important to establish a strong starting point. It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer right away, but it will give me a good understanding of his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not eager to sell for that amount.  I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $18,000. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise, but still above my minimum price. I believe this offer is fair and hopefully, Bob will see the value in closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $16,000. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $17,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $16,500. We've gone back and forth a few times, and I'm getting close to my minimum.  I'm confident that I can't get a significantly higher price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
