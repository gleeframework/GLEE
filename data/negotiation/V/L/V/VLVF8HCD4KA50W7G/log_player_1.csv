Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, but still ensures Alice a significant profit.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly avoids the need to find another buyer and potentially wait longer. 

This offer creates a win-win scenario where Bob gets the product for less than its worth to him, and Alice maximizes her profit."
