,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for you to profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  This would allow both of us to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still trying to understand your budget constraints. While $875,000 is a step closer, I'm only willing to go down to $890,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you a good profit margin and me a fair return. Let's try to bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,
