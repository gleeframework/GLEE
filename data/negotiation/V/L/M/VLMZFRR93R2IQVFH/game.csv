,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? This would still be a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to make it work.",13000.0,Bob,4,
