"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $820,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget while still reflecting the product's worth to me.",820000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $820,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your company.  I'm willing to be flexible, and I'm prepared to offer you a lower price of $880,000, which is still a significant gain for you. This allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's work together to make this happen.",880000.0,Alice,3,
