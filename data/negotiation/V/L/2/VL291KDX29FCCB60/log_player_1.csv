"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm raising the price slightly, hoping to meet halfway with Bob. I believe he's serious about buying the product, and this counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maximizing my profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}

I'm sticking to my strategy of making incremental counteroffers. I believe Bob is very close to my target price, and this offer will hopefully be enough to close the deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still hopeful that Bob will increase his offer.  While selling to John would guarantee a profit, I'd prefer to get more from Bob if possible.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 935000}

I'm making a small concession, but still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired amount. I'm getting a bit concerned about time, but I believe Bob is close to reaching my target."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Time is running out, and Bob's offers are getting progressively lower. I'm no longer confident that I can get a better deal with him. While it's not ideal to sell to John at $800,000, it's the most logical option at this point to secure a profit. I'll move on and hope to find a better deal in the future."
