Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $11,000, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200.

``` 

Alice is very slowly increasing her offers.  At this pace, it's unlikely further negotiation will result in a significantly better price. Accepting her offer of $11,200 secures a good deal."
