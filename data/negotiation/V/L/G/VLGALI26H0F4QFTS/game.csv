"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. I think this is a more reasonable compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
