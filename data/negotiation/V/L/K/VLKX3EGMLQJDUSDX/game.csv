"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for the product.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $9000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $9200, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm genuinely interested in this product.  However, $9200 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay right now.  Would you be willing to consider $8800?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",8800.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're making a serious effort to find a price we can both agree on. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'm not budging from that. It's the lowest I can go and still meet my minimum requirements. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,7,
