"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to this amount?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet at $900,000. I would like to propose a price of $850,000. This is my best offer within my budget constraints.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation, but $850,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $875,000. This reflects a compromise on both sides and allows us to finalize the transaction.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I've considered your latest offer carefully, and while it's closer to my budget, I'm still not able to meet at $875,000. I would like to propose a final offer of $825,000. This is my best offer given my financial constraints.",825000.0,Bob,6,
