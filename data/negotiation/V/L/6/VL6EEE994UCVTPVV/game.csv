"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,600?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with.",8600.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8,600. How about we meet in the middle at $8,400? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get a better deal than $8,600.",8400.0,Bob,4,
