"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice.  While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would that be feasible?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised by offering $1,350,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but that's as low as I can go.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is very close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $1,150,000?  This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession by offering $1,250,000. I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm going to have to pass on your offer and see if I can find a more willing buyer. The product is still available for sale to John for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
