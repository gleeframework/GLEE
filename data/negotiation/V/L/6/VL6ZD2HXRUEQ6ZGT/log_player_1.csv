Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a significant discount to Bob** while still giving me a good profit. 
* **Is above my minimum acceptable price** of $8,000, ensuring I don't lose money if he accepts.
* **Leaves room for negotiation**. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly but still have room to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher profit.  Rejecting his offer allows me to try and secure a better price through counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is above my minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum of $8,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** While I'm lowering the price, it's not a drastic drop, which gives me some room to negotiate further if necessary.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, highlighting that this is still a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,750 is very close to my preferred price and above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It's also a good compromise considering the previous counteroffers.  Accepting the offer ensures a good profit and avoids further negotiation, which could potentially lead to a lower price or a breakdown in the deal."
