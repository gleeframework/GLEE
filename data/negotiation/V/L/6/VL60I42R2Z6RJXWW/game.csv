"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for sending me your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $7,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $7,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product for $7,200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7200.0,Alice,5,
