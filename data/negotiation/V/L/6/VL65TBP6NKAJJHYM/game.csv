"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1300000, but I believe that's the lowest I can go. I'm confident that the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1250000 is a fair price for this product.

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1230000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to a price that reflects its value. I'm thinking of $1250000, which is actually higher than your last offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1230000 and $1250000, so I'll offer $1240000. Can you consider that?",1240000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiations, Bob, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1220000. I'm willing to make one final concession, so I'll meet you halfway between $1210000 and $1220000, which is $1215000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1215000.0,Alice,9,
