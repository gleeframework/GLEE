"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $11,000 is a bit more than I was hoping for.  Would you consider $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,800 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,600.  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $10,600. How about we try $10,700? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price.",10700.0,Alice,5,
