"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is within his budget, there's a good chance he can get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and secure a deal closer to his $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $11,000 is a bit more than I was hoping for.  Would you consider $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $10,800 is closer to his budget than Alice's initial offer, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue bargaining and potentially get closer to his $10,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,800 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,600.  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $10,600. How about we try $10,700? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price, but Alice is still unwilling to go below $10,700. While this is a tempting offer, Bob is only $700 away from his ideal price. It's a better strategy for Bob to secure the product at his target price from John, guaranteeing a successful deal within his budget."
