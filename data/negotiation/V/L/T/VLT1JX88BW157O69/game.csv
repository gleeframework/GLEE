"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your new offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I still believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product.
