"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This is a bold opening move, designed to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation.  I'm confident in the value of my product, but I'm also prepared to adjust my offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for potential negotiation.  I want to keep the momentum going and avoid giving up too much ground too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is my minimum price. While I could keep negotiating, I'm not sure if Bob is willing to go higher. I'd rather secure the deal at my minimum price than risk losing him and ending up with John's offer, which is the same amount."
