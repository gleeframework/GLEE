"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. By rejecting the offer, I can try to negotiate a better deal. I have 10 rounds, so there's room to explore."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by 25%. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and signals my willingness to walk away if the price isn't right.  This aggressive move will hopefully push Alice to consider a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I still believe there's room for further negotiation. Alice has already come down in price, which suggests she's willing to compromise. I'll continue to counteroffer in hopes of securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still want a price closer to my initial counteroffer. This moderate increase may encourage Alice to compromise further."
