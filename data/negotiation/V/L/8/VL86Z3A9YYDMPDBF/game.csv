"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to you and still allows me to make a substantial profit.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for less than half of its value to you.  Let's close this deal!",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a great deal, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a little further to $975,000, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal!",975000.0,Alice,5,
