"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the potential benefits it holds. Please let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
