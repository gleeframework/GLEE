# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it!

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a fair compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer the product to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is getting closer to a more reasonable price, it's clear she's unlikely to go much lower than her current offer of $13,500.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $12,000, it's in your best interest to take that deal and save the $1,500."
