"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $95.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible. $95 is too close to John's price of $100.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $95 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $85 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I can't go that low. How about $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still trying to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $95, you can likely negotiate a lower price."
