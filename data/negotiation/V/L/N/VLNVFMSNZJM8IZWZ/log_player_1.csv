"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($800,000) and to Bob ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential benefits of the product for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he has a chance to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is lower than the product's worth to me ($800,000).  I'm willing to negotiate further but not at that price.  It's important to keep in mind that I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for $800,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000,  reflecting the value of this product and allowing for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that is still higher than my minimum ($800,000) but lower than my initial offer ($900,000). 
* **Negotiation:** This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and focused on finding a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. This offer demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate, there is no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further. Selling to Bob at this price ensures I achieve my minimum goal and closes the deal. This also prevents me from potentially losing out on the deal if Bob decides to walk away, or if I run out of negotiation rounds."
