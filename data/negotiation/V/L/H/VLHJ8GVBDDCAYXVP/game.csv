"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1200000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects a substantial discount while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1750000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'd like to propose a compromise at $1550000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I can get from the product, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
