Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1200000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects a substantial discount while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.
