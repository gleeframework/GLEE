"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your desired selling price. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair offer, considering the value of the product to me and your desire to sell it. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $875,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle again at $887,500? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
