Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000.  This offer stands for a limited time, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,100,000 is a substantial profit for me (almost $300,000 over my minimum) and still offers Bob a $300,000 gain compared to his perceived value. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning a limited time and ""other interested parties,"" I create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly."
