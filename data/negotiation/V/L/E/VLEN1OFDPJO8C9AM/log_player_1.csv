Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. $80 is too low for me, considering the product is worth at least $100 to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about $95?  This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $100.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $87.5 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum price. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $87.50, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price.  Would you be willing to go up to $92.50?  That's a fair compromise and leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to go up a bit, how about $90 even? That's a solid offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can get a little more. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get Bob to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $91?  I'm confident that this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 91}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I feel like we're splitting hairs at this point.  My last offer is $90.50.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  The negotiations with Bob have gone on for a while, and I'm not confident that I can get him to agree to a price that is significantly higher than $90.50.  It's time to move on to a more guaranteed sale."
