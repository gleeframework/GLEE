"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $100 to you. Let me know if you're interested!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about $95?  This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $100.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $80 was too low. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50?  That's a fair compromise.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $87.50, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price.  Would you be willing to go up to $92.50?  That's a fair compromise and leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to go up a bit, how about $90 even? That's a solid offer.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $91?  I'm confident that this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's make this deal happen.",91.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I feel like we're splitting hairs at this point.  My last offer is $90.50.  Take it or leave it.",90.5,Bob,8,
