Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and is below Bob's perceived value.  It also sets a friendly tone to encourage negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still above my minimum price of $100, and it's likely he won't budge much further. Accepting his offer is the best course of action to ensure a quick sale and maximize my earnings."
