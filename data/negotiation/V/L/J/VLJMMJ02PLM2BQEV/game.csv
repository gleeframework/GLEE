"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product.  I'm confident it will be highly beneficial for you.  As a starting point, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair value considering its potential.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, considering its potential. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget considerations, however, $850,000 undervalues the true potential and benefits this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,025,000.  This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,025,000 is still out of my range.  Let's try $950,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $980,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a significant offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and our shared desire to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
