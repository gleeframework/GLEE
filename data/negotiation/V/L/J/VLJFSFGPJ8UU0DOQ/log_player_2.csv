"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $12,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and leaves some room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try and get a lower price. There are still several rounds remaining, and Bob has the option to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a more aggressive counteroffer, getting closer to his limit of $15,000. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying, but still has a firm price point. It's likely that Alice will either accept this offer or counter with a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,500 is still above Bob's budget. While it's getting closer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob a chance to potentially secure a better deal.  With only a few rounds left, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making his final counteroffer.  It's his absolute limit, and he's taking a risk by putting it on the table. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob has the backup option of buying from John. There's no point in negotiating further, as Bob has already reached his budget. This offer gives Alice a clear decision point: accept and close the deal, or risk losing Bob as a buyer."
