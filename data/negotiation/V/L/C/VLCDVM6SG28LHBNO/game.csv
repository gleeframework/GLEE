"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This reflects my product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I hope we can meet at this price.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,350,000 is a serious offer, and I can see you're a motivated buyer. To be completely transparent, I have a hard minimum of $1,400,000 for this product. If you can meet that, we have a deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a hard minimum of $1,400,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to commit to the deal at this point.",1375000.0,Bob,6,
