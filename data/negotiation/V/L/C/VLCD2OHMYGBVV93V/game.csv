"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1500000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $800000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a budget of $800000, but I'm afraid the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1200000 for it. Can you consider a price of $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1100000 is still outside my range. I'm sticking to my original offer of $800000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $1000000. Let's try to find a sweet spot. How about $950000?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $950000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $850000. This is my absolute maximum, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  If not, I'll need to consider other options.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $975000. Can you consider a price of $925000?",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm pushing the limits of my budget here, but I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to move on to other options.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",950000.0,Alice,9,
