,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and it reflects my desire to work with you.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a little too low for me. However, I'm willing to make one last compromise. How about $1,050,000? This is a significant drop from my previous offer, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, so how about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
