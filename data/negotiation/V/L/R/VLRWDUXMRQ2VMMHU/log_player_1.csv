"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a great deal to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not outrageously so. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the value to Bob reinforces the potential benefits of the deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a question, implying I'm open to discussion and a potential counteroffer.

**Note:**  I'm aware I could instantly sell to John for $1,000,000, but I'm choosing to negotiate with Bob first to see if I can get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While $900,000 is better than his previous valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I can counter with a slightly lower price, hopefully finding a middle ground.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit, but I'm willing to take a risk and continue negotiating with Bob for potentially a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and it reflects my desire to work with you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Reduction:**  I'm reducing my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that this is a good deal. 
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  I'm ending with a question, leaving room for further negotiation. 

**Strategy:** I want to find a balance between securing a decent profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. I believe $1,100,000 is a reasonable middle ground at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While closer, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm determined to get closer to my target.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  We're getting closer with each round. I'm hopeful that with a couple more counteroffers, I can get Bob to agree to a price closer to my desired range.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is secure, I'm still holding out hope that I can get a better price from Bob. The potential for a higher profit motivates me to continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a little too low for me. However, I'm willing to make one last compromise. How about $1,050,000? This is a significant drop from my previous offer, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a final attempt to bridge the gap with Bob, acknowledging his budget limitations while still securing a price close to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I highlight the significant price drop from the previous round, emphasizing the willingness to find a middle ground. 
* **Closing the Deal:** I use a confident and persuasive tone, suggesting that this is a reasonable offer that will allow us to finalize the deal. 

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a quick resolution with this offer.  If Bob rejects, I'm ready to sell to John for $1,000,000 to avoid losing too much time and potentially missing out on a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, so how about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While closer to my desired price, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:**  We've gone through several rounds, and the gap between our desired prices is narrowing, but not enough to justify further negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  At this point, the potential reward of getting a slightly higher price from Bob isn't worth the risk of losing more time and potentially missing out on a guaranteed sale to John. 

**Conclusion:** 

It's time to move on to a guaranteed sale. Selling to John for $1,000,000 secures a profitable outcome, allowing me to avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation and ensure I get the minimum price I'm comfortable with."
