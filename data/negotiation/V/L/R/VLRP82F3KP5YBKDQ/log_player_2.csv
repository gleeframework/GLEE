This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price ($110) but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

You've rejected Alice's offer of $115, but you're getting closer to a deal.  This counteroffer of $110 splits the difference between your maximum price ($120) and her last offer. This should put you in a good position to close the deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**
