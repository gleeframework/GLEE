"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this product, Bob. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12500. I think you'll find it's a great value, considering its worth to you is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $15,000.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further with Alice, accepting her offer guarantees a lower price than John's."
