,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000, which would be $8,750. Would you be willing to accept that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good price, and I respect that.  However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go down to $8,900.  This is a small compromise on my part, and it gives you a good price.  What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,900 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
