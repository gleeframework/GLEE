# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $100 is too low, but I want to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $100 just isn't feasible for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $125. This still gives you a good deal on a product worth $120 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
