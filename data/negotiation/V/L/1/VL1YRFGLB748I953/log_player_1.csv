Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get close to my minimum value.  It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still above Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to drop my price any further. Selling to John for $15,000 is the best option at this point."
