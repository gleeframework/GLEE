"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I will reject Alice's offer because it's too expensive for me. The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $200, which is more than twice the price I'm willing to pay. I will reject the offer and try to find a better deal.
