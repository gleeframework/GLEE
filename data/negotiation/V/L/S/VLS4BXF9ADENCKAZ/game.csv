"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire something truly unique. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is unique, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,250,000? I believe this price reflects the true worth and potential of what's on offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
