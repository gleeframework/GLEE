Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose a price of $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it's a bit closer to my target range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
At this point, Bob's offer of $975,000 is a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).  Continuing to negotiate risks him lowering his offer or you being forced to take the $800,000 from John. It's best to accept the solid offer on the table."
