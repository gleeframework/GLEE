"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a nice product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $11,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. It's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product at a price that's still below its true value!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and my previous offer of $11,000. How about $10,250? It's a great deal that still gives you a good discount, and I think you'll love the product!",10250.0,Alice,5,
