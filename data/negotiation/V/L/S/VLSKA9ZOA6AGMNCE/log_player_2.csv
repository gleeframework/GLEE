Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750, but I'll throw in a small concession. How about I give you an additional 1% discount, making it $9,662.50? It's a great deal that's hard to pass up! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,662.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,662.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```
This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've managed to get the price down to $9,662.50, a substantial saving from both the initial offer and John's price.
* **Time Invested:** You've already spent several rounds negotiating. Continuing might yield a slightly better price, but the gains might be small compared to the time and effort required. 
* **Alice's Concessions:** Alice is clearly motivated to sell and has been making concessions.  

While there's a small chance of getting the price lower, accepting now secures a great deal and avoids the risk of Alice hardening her stance later in the negotiation.
