"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $92? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $88.  That's a fair price for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $88 is still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $91? I'm getting a bit concerned that if I don't sell this product soon, I might miss out on other opportunities. I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit.",91.0,Alice,5,
