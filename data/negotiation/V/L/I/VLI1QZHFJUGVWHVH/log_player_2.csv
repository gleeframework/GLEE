Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a better price, even if it means going through a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $92? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his ideal price, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He's willing to pay up to $120, so there's room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $88.  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $88 is still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $91? I'm getting a bit concerned that if I don't sell this product soon, I might miss out on other opportunities. I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While $91 is higher than his ideal price, it's still lower than what he'd pay John ($120).  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept and secure the product at a reasonable price."
