Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you're confident in the product's value and sets the tone for a potentially profitable negotiation.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than John's offer of $8,000, there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to your desired $12,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet halfway:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** By coming down in price, you demonstrate your desire to reach an agreement while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Keep the pressure on:**  The message emphasizes that you're still looking for a better price, prompting Bob to consider raising his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to your desired price of $11,000. While you could continue negotiating, the risk of him rejecting your next counteroffer and ultimately going with John's $8,000 offer is too high. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees you a profit of $2,500, which is a good outcome considering your minimum target was $8,000."
