"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $85 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? This would give us both a good deal.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $87.50?  That seems like a fair compromise.",87.5,Bob,4,
