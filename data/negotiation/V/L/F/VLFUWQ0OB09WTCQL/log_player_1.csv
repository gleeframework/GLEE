Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low.  It's below my minimum price of $150, and I'm confident I can do better. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me. How about $140? This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $150. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get a better offer from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $130 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. This is my final offer before I move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $128 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I've already given him a few counteroffers, and it seems we're at an impasse.  Rather than continue to negotiate and potentially waste time, I'll sell the product to John for $150. This guarantees me a good return and saves me from potentially losing out on the deal with John."
