"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it could really benefit you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a maximum of $8,000.  Would you consider something closer to that?",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $4,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product offers significant value, and I believe this price reflects a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product offers value, but $17,000 is still significantly more than I'm willing to spend. I could potentially go up to $5,500, but that's really my absolute limit.",5500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $5,500 is significantly below its true value. I can go down to $13,000, but that's my final offer. It's a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a compromise.  Let me know your decision.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, there's still a significant gap between your offer and what I'm prepared to spend.  My absolute limit is $6,000.  If that's not workable, I understand, but I won't be able to go any higher.",6000.0,Bob,6,
