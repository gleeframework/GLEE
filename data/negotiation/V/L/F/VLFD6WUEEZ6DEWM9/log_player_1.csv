Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $15,000 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  
* **""Take it or Leave it"" Approach:** This can make your offer seem more valuable and discourage haggling. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's value to Bob, he might not be as aware.  Your message should subtly convey the product's worth.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  A higher offer has a higher chance of rejection. If you're risk-averse, you might offer a price closer to $10,000 to ensure a sale."
