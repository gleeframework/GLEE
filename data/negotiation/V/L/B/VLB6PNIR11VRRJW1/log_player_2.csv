"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $110. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $110, which is less than your maximum price, but still more than the product's value to her ($80).
* You can get the product for $120 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  You can save $10 by waiting and buying from John."
