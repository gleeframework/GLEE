"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I've taken your offer into consideration, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1300000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,1400000.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to come down to $1400000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,5,,

"I understand that you think the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1400000. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I need to be honest, I'm getting a bit concerned that I might be able to find a better deal elsewhere. Can you consider going lower?",1200000.0,Bob,6,,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already come down significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to go down to $1350000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1350000.0,Alice,7,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, and that's my final offer. If I don't get it, I'll have to consider going with John's offer. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,8,,
