Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $12,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my minimum and what I know the product is worth to him. It's too early to settle. I'll counter, but I need to nudge him closer to a reasonable price.

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects the value it brings while still being a fair deal for you."", ""product_price"": 17000}
