,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $975,000. Can we meet in the middle again?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000, which is closer to your last offer. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $987,500. This is my final offer, let's see if we can make a deal.",987500.0,Bob,6,
