{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Reasoning:** This creates room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Open communication:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.
* **Safety net:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I want to make a deal, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss. It's better to continue negotiating and try to get closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer of $1,050,000.
* **Reasoning:** This is a compromise that's still above Bob's initial offer but closer to his estimated value.
* **Framing:** I'm emphasizing ""fairness"" and the ""value of the product"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Open-ended:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by ending with ""Let's see if we can close this deal."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $975,000. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I am willing to continue negotiating, but I will not accept any offer below my minimum threshold.  The potential for John's offer to be a better option makes it worthwhile to continue negotiating with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000, which is closer to your last offer. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer of $1,025,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $987,500. This is my final offer, let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $987,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, as I can get a better price from John. I've already made several concessions, and I'm confident that John will be a more reliable buyer."
