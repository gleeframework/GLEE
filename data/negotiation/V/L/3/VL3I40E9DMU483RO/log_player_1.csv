We are still significantly above John's offer, so we should hold firm for now. Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate upwards, which is a positive sign."

Bob has significantly dropped his offer and is now below John's standing offer of $1,500,000. It's unlikely he'll bridge the gap to a satisfactory amount. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
