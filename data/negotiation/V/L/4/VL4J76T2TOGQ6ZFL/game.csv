"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, though. How about we try $155? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",155.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your situation, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I've already gone as low as I can. I'm willing to meet you at $150, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll consider it.",150.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $150, but I was thinking I could get it for $130. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make it fit within my budget.",130.0,Bob,8,
