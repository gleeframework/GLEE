Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $12,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive framing:** My message highlights the benefits for Bob, emphasizing the value he'll get.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to counteroffers, but I have a backup option in John, so I don't need to accept an offer that's too low. 

By offering a price just above Bob's perceived value, I aim to maximize my earnings while still keeping the deal attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. Please let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would be a significant loss for me.
* **John is a better option:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000.  There's no reason to risk getting stuck at a lower price with Bob.
* **Counter-offering could be risky:** While I could counteroffer Bob, it's unclear if he'd be willing to budge.  There's a chance he'd reject my counteroffer and I'd be left with a lower price than John's offer.

It's more strategic to reject Bob's offer and secure the higher price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'd be happy to accept $13,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my opportunity cost.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's midway between my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate but still leaves me with a good profit.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and the opportunity cost of losing it. 
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging Bob to consider my offer.

By offering a compromise and appealing to Bob's interest, I'm trying to reach a mutually acceptable agreement while staying above my minimum acceptable price."
