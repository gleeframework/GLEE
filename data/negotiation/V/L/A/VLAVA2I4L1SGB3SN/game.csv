"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $110 is still a bit steep for me. How about $70? That's a fair compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're not that far apart.  I can't do $70, but to show I'm flexible, how about $95 and we have a deal?",95.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, could we do it for $75?  That's the best I can do.",75.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm sensing you're really interested in this product. I'm willing to make one last concession to make this work.  How about $85, and we close the deal now?",85.0,Alice,7,
