"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a decent price, you can do better. You're willing to pay $1,200,000, and Alice is likely willing to go lower than her initial offer since the product is only worth $800,000 to her.  By rejecting her offer, you open the door for further negotiation and a potentially better deal."
