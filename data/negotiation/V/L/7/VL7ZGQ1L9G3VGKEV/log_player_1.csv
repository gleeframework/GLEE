"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's minimum value to me. It's important to gauge Bob's initial reaction to see if he's interested in negotiating at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I still have 8 rounds left and can always sell to John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $16,500, which is closer to my ideal price.  I'm going to accept this offer and sell the product to Bob. It's a good profit and I've avoided the risk of going through more rounds and potentially ending up with John's offer of $15,000."
