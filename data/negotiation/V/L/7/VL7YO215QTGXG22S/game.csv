"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $80 is far too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least get $120 for it.  Let's meet in the middle.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to drop my price to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for a product of this quality. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there. How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, and I respect that. I'm willing to go down to $95. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I have another buyer waiting.",95.0,Alice,7,
