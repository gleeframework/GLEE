# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  While it's worth a significant amount to me, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.  This price is still higher than what it's worth to you, but represents a considerable discount from my true value. Let me know your thoughts!
