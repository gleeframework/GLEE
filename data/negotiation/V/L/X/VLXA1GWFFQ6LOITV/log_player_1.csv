Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth at least $90. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, leaving room for negotiation. This sets the stage for a potentially profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $80, which is the price John is offering. Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, and John is also offering the same.  At this point, there's no incentive to continue negotiating with Bob. I'll sell to John to secure the deal quickly and avoid any further potential complications."
