I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  We're already in round 4, and there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further. It's time to make a more aggressive counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're in round 6, and the negotiations are getting tense. While I could keep going back and forth, I'm starting to feel like Bob is pushing his luck.  He's not budging much from his initial counteroffer, and we're running out of time. It's safer to accept John's offer and secure the $1,200,000. It's the most reliable option at this point."
