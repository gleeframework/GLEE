"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, it's still above the product's true value to her ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price. You're willing to walk away from the deal, leveraging your option to buy from John for $15,000."
