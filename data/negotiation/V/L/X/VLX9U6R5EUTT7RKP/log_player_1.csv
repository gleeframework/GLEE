Round 2

While it's less than ideal, accepting Bob's offer of $995,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point of the negotiation, and Bob is clearly holding firm around this price point. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the deal entirely increases.  The potential gains from further negotiation are likely small. 
* **Profitable Deal:**  Even at $995,000, we are still making a significant profit from the product. 

It's always tough to leave some money on the table, but sometimes a good deal in hand is better than the risk of walking away with nothing."
