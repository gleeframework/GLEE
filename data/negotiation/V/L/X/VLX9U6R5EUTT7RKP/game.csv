"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product holds substantial value and I'm confident it can bring you significant returns.  Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my price. Would you consider $1,020,000?  This is my final offer.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,020,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $995,000, but I need you to meet me there. This is my final offer.",995000.0,Bob,6,
