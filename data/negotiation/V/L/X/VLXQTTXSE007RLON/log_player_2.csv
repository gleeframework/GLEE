"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you $650,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $650,000 is pushing the limits of what I can justify.  I could potentially stretch to $620,000, but that's my absolute final offer."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $620,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I think I deserve a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $640,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $640,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $640,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue to negotiate, Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  The difference between her $640,000 and our target of $620,000 is relatively small at this stage. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price, and we risk pushing Alice away completely. Accepting now secures a reasonable deal."
