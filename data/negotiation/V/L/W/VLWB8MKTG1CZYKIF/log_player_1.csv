Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, which reflects its value to me and leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and is closer to the value I've assessed for this product.  Let's work together to reach a mutually acceptable deal.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and is closer to my limit.  This deal would be beneficial to both of us, as it allows me to acquire the product and you to gain a sale that's within a reasonable range.  Let's work together to close this deal.
