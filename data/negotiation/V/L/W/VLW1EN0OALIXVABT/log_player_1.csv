Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'll start with a relatively high price. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": 1,200,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob rejected my initial offer and made a counteroffer of $1,000,000. Since this is the minimum value I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer. I'll sell the product to Bob for $1,000,000.
