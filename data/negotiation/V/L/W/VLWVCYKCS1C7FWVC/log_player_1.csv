This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, but it's still lower than the product's value to Bob. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving you with a significant profit."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."

Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm now risking losing too much money by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept John's offer and sell the product for $800,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than nothing."
