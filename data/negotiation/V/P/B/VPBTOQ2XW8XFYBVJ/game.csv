"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise at $950,000. This is my final offer before considering other options.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit rich for me. How about we settle at $800,000? This is my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already mentioned that $800,000 is below my minimum, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
