"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference – I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're driving a hard bargain!  I'm willing to come down slightly more, but I need to stay above $1,090,000. Would you be willing to do $1,095,000?",1095000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,095,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to offer $1,085,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close the deal.",1085000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you seem determined to get this at the best possible price! I respect that.  How about this – my final offer is $1,090,000.  Take it or leave it.",1090000.0,Alice,7,
