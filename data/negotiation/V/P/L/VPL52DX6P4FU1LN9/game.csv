"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my price range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can do $13,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
