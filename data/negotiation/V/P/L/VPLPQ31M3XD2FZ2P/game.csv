"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $100. How about we try $92? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above that.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $92 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we settle at $98? That seems like a fair compromise, considering the value of this product.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and $98, which would be $95. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference again and go with $97.  I'm confident this product will be well worth the investment for you.",97.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $97 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $97, which would be $96. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",96.0,Bob,8,
