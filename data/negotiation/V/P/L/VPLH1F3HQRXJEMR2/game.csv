"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the results. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to come down to $885,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",885000.0,Alice,5,
