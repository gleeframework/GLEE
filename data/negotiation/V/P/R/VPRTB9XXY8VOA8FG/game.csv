"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $140?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $150. This would be a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $155. This is as close to the middle as I can get.",155.0,Alice,5,
