"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay the full $1200000. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you closer to your offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 6-month warranty. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a great price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
