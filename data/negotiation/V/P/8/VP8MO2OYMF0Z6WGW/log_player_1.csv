Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay the full $1200000. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is less than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($1,200,000), I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round.
