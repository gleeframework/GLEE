"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,500?"",

``` 

This counter-offer attempts to anchor the negotiation closer to Alice's valuation while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $13,500?  I'm confident this product will still bring you significant value at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, there's still potential for a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a fair offer considering the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price closer to my target. It also introduces a sense of compromise to encourage Alice's agreement."
