""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to exploring possibilities."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it would bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significant, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I consider fair. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,125,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is slowly coming up in price, we're still significantly above John's offer. It's worth pushing a bit more to see if we can get closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've given your offer serious consideration. How about we split the difference between our last two proposals and settle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to my desired price point. By offering to split the difference, I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a strong profit. This price is a good balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, so how about $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly anchored at $1,075,000 and hasn't budged from that price in two rounds.  While we could likely squeeze a bit more, the difference is getting smaller. Accepting now guarantees a significant profit ($75,000 more than John's offer) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
