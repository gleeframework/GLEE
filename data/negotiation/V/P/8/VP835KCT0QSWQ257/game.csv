"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it would bring to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significant, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I consider fair. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've given your offer serious consideration. How about we split the difference between our last two proposals and settle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
