Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is strategically calculated:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Lower than Bob's value:**  $1,400,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,500,000), giving him an incentive to accept.

This approach maximizes your chances of getting a higher price while still leaving room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario for both of you."
