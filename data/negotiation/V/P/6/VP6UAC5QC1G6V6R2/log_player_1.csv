{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price but still allows for some room for negotiation.  I'm curious to see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm countering with $140. This is a compromise between my original offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it shows my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $130 is a good deal and significantly better than selling to John.  It's time to close this negotiation!"
