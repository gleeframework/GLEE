Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $12,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence in trying to meet somewhere in the middle. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $12,875 for the product. I hope this offer is within your range and allows us to move forward with the transaction.
