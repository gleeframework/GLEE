Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Unknown Information:** You don't know Bob's negotiation style, how much he's willing to pay, or if he's aware of other potential buyers. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high without alienating Bob. Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and emphasizes the product's value.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:**  You're not just throwing out a number; you're connecting it to the ""return on investment,"" subtly implying Bob would be getting a good deal even at this price.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go. 
* **Confidence:**  Present your offer confidently. If Bob senses hesitation, he might push for a lower price.
