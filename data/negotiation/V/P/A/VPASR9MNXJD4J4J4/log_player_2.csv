"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $1,400,000 is higher than Alice's valuation, it's still less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
