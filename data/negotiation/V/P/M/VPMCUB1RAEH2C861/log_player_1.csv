{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer sets a price that is higher than your minimum value, hoping to maximize your profit. However, it's still a price that Bob might be willing to pay if the product holds significant value for him. If he rejects the offer, you can still sell it to John for your minimum value, ensuring you don't lose money."
