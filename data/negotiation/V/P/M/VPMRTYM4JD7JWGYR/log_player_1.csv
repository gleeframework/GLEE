Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to me and it's still well above your minimum. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $9,000, I can likely get closer to my desired price of $15,000. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you.  Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's try to close the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  Even though we're getting closer, I'm not going to settle for $9,000 yet. I'm confident I can push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,750? This is a fair price that's still below what the product is worth to you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's not let this opportunity slip away!"", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still hopeful we can reach a deal, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,250. This is a fair price that gets us closer to a deal and ensures a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
