{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to create a sense of urgency and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Flexibility:** I'm ready to negotiate if Bob rejects the offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**  I need to make a profit, and $6,000 wouldn't cover my costs and the value of the product.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating.**  I can try to get a better price from Bob or, if he refuses to budge, I can sell to John for a much higher price.
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I want to explore all negotiation possibilities with Bob first.**  He might be willing to pay more if I counteroffer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand $6,000 is your current offer, it's unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still offers you a good value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer but also not sticking to my initial high price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justify the price:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and suggesting that $8,500 is a fair price for both parties.
* **Keep the negotiation open:**  I'm using a friendly tone and asking for Bob's opinion, hoping to continue the negotiation and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's closer to my desired range, it's still not enough to cover my costs and the value I place on the product.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I can likely get a better price if I push for it.
* **Selling to John is still a viable option, but I want to explore all possibilities with Bob first.**  I'm not desperate to sell and can afford to be patient in my negotiation."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're aiming for $7,000, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slight compromise:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer but also not sticking to my previous offer. This shows I'm still open to negotiation but not willing to settle for too low a price.
* **Reiterate value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Push for a deal:** I use assertive language to indicate that I'm serious about getting a deal done. 
* **Offer a final compromise:** I'm suggesting a middle ground, making it easier for Bob to accept."
