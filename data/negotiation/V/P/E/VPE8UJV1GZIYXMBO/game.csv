"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand $6,000 is your current offer, it's unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still offers you a good value.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're aiming for $7,000, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,000, and we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
