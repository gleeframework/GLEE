"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secures a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This is a firm price, but it's still a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm not yet willing to sell to John for $1,200,000, because I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. It's a compromise, but still within my acceptable range. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating with Bob.  I still believe I can get a better price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm hoping this compromise will finally convince Bob to close the deal. We're running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I don't lose out on this sale completely.  It's not ideal, but it's a safe option at this point."
