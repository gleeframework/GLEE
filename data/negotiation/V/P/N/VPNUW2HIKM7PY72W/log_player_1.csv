Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value of $1,000,000, it is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I believe this price is still fair and attractive to Bob, while also getting me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go lower than $1,500,000.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
