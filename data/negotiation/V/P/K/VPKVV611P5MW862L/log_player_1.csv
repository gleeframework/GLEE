Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 2300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher final price.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,300,000, we set a high anchor in Bob's mind. While this is significantly higher than his perceived value, it makes subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price signals that we're willing to negotiate. It invites Bob to counteroffer and engage in the bargaining process.
* **Backup Plan:** We always have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000, ensuring we don't settle for less than our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $2,300,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we want to negotiate, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. We know John provides a safety net, but we can still try to negotiate a better deal with Bob before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price needs to reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer takes into account the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a significant concession from our initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Above the Minimum:** The new price is still comfortably above our $1,500,000 minimum and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** We're framing the price reduction as a strategic decision based on finding a ""middle ground"" rather than desperation.
* **Positive Tone:** We maintain a collaborative and respectful tone to encourage Bob's continued participation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe we can find a better agreement. I would like to propose a counteroffer at $1,700,000. I hope this proposal is more within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, the difference is no longer significant enough to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit."
