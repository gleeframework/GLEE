Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $9,500 is above your minimum of $8,000, so you're already starting in a good position.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It shows you're flexible:** By not starting at your highest possible price, you demonstrate you're open to a deal.

This strategy aims to get a good starting point for negotiation without being overly aggressive.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $8,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can still aim for a better price. By rejecting his offer and counter-offering, you can potentially secure a higher price.  Even if you don't reach his desired $9,500, you might be able to get closer to your target.  

We'll analyze his offer and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,200 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,600?  That's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 8600}
```

Here's why we're going with this counteroffer:

* **Compromise:**  This price is a midpoint between your previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,200.  It shows you're willing to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Still above minimum:**  $8,600 is still above your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to continue negotiating. 

We'll see if this offer gets Bob closer to your desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. I believe $8,400 would be a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,400 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures a good profit. 

The negotiation process took a few rounds, but we managed to find a price that works for both of us. Selling to Bob for $8,400 is a better outcome than selling to John for $8,000."
