"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $20000 and $15000. How about $17500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $17500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $16000?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16000 is as high as you're willing to go, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about $16750? It's still a good deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",16750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart, Alice. I'm still willing to pay $16000, and I think that's a fair price for the product. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $16000?",16000.0,Bob,6,
