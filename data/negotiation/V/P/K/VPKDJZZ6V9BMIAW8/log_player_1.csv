Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a fair price that is above Bob's valuation but below my minimum acceptable price. This allows for some room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105. This is a compromise between his offer of $95 and my previous offer of $110. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob, allowing us to finalize the deal without having to involve John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer of $90 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. John is a sure thing at $120, and I'm not confident Bob will come up to a price that satisfies me. I'm going to sell the product to John."
