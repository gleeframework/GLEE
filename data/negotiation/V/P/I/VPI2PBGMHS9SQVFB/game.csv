"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget for this purchase is significantly lower.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $850,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm still interested in the product, $1,075,000 is still outside my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product to me and acknowledges your need to make a profit.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
