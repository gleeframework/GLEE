"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm not willing to pay the full $115. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50? This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to reach an agreement.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
