"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $140 is still a bit more than you are willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer.  $135 is within your budget and a better deal than buying from John for $150."
