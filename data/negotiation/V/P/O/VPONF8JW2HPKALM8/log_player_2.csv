Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle at $825,000?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $825,000. I can sell the product to you for $837,500. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting very close to your budget, you're still within the negotiation rounds and can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and try to push her lower. You're also very close to the price offered by John, so if the negotiation doesn't go your way, you can always buy from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price.  How about $820,000?  This is just a little bit lower than your last offer, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 820000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $820,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $835,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above your target price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will not budge further and you'll end up paying more than you want.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price and saves you the risk of further negotiation."
