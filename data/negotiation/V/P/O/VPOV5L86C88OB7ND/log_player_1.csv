Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,700,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob is still significantly under the product's value to me. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a major loss.  I'll counter-offer again to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I need to make sure this works on my end.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

While I could push for more, Bob landing at $1,250,000 means he's likely very close to his maximum. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of him walking away and ensures a very good profit."
