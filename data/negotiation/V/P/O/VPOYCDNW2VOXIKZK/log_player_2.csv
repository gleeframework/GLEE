"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than her perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation to save some money.  The counteroffer strategy aims to leverage this difference and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,420,000. I believe this price still represents a fair value for the product, considering its worth to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,420,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit high, but we're making progress. There's room for further negotiation to try and get the price closer to our ideal target of $1,300,000. We'll continue to negotiate with Alice before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, I'm still committed to finding a price that works for both of us. Let's compromise at $1,350,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. How about we try $1,380,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to our desired price, we're still within reach of a better deal. It's worth pushing a little further to see if we can get closer to our $1,350,000 counteroffer. We're not in a rush to buy from John yet, as we're making good progress with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still aiming for $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between our needs, and it would be a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a final decision on this price."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not ready to meet you at $1,350,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $1,400,000 again? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a bit higher than our last counteroffer, we're still within the range of a reasonable deal, and we're only a few rounds away from making a decision. We're also making progress in lowering the price and are not at a point where buying from John would be a better option.  Therefore, it's worth continuing the negotiation with Alice to see if we can find a final price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,370,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to compromise at $1,390,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,390,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,390,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,390,000 is within our budget and represents a good compromise. We've made significant progress in lowering the price, and with only one round left, it's unlikely we can get a better deal. It's more advantageous to accept this offer than risk getting a worse deal in the final round or buying from John at a higher price."
