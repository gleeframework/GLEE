Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts, you've secured a great deal. If he negotiates, you know he's interested. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
