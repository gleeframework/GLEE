"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'd be happy to offer you $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth significantly more, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within a reasonable range. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk another round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $950,000 is still not enough.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?  This price is fair, it's closer to my valuation of the product, and it gives you a better deal than my initial offer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still slightly higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get it down to my target price of $1,000,000 or close to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I can justify. I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,000,000, which reflects the value I place on this product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
