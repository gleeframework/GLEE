"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $12,000 to us, but we're willing to consider your valuation. To start, how about we discuss a price that reflects its true value to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low as possible, ideally under $8,000.  Alice's initial offer of $10,000 is still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to consider a price closer to $8,000, reflecting the value I'm placing on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your perspective and are willing to meet you halfway. Our counteroffer for the product is $9,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $10,000, it's still above Bob's target price of $8,000.  Bob has 7 rounds left and can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  However, $9,250 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 8750}
