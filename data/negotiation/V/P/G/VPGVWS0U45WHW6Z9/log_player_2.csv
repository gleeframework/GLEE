"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget.  You can likely negotiate further and get closer to your desired price point.  You have 7 rounds remaining, so there's room to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $9,500?  This would be a good compromise and get us closer to a deal. "", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're willing to make a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $11,000? This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, $11,000 is still above your target price.  With 5 rounds left, you have time to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a better price.  You can also consider the possibility of going to John if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $11,000 is still out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again, but I can't go above $10,000.  Let's try to make this happen. "", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $11,500? This is the last offer I can make, and I hope we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget and you're running out of rounds.  With only 3 rounds left, there's not enough time to negotiate much lower.  John's offer provides you with the product at your desired price point. It's the most sensible decision at this point."
