"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I believe it's worth considering a price of $900,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still a significant amount of money. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal by counter-offering. You're still saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John, so the risk of losing the deal is worth taking to try and save more."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $900,000. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  If you're open to that, I'm ready to make a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $800,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement from her initial offer of $900,000 and gets you closer to your desired price point of $800,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might walk away, leaving you with the option of buying from John for $1,000,000. Accepting the offer guarantees you a good deal, saving you $150,000 compared to John."
