"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that it's likely Bob will counter.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully settle on a price closer to my goal.  I'm also emphasizing the win-win aspect of the deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to counteroffer at $750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to hold out for a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is my final offer. This price still reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to counteroffer at $825,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $800,000."
