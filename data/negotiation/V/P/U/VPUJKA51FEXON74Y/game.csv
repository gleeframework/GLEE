"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its value. How about we meet halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we meet at $1,100,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, the value of this product is truly exceptional, and $1,100,000 is still below its true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product is worth a lot, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a final offer, so I'll meet you at $1,075,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
