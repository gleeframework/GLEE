**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's very unlikely to reach a price point that's significantly closer to your minimum ($1,200,000).  Continuing the negotiation risks leaving you with a lower offer or running out of rounds. John provides a guaranteed sale at your desired price, making it the most logical decision at this point."
