{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts by building rapport with Bob, then presents a price that is a good starting point for negotiation. It's a price higher than my minimum but still attractive to Bob, considering he values the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is higher than what I would get from John, it's still lower than my desired price. I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $105 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my final offer. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to sell for closer to $112.50, accepting Bob's offer of $100 is still a good deal.  It's significantly better than selling to John for $80, and it's getting closer to my desired price.  I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate."
