{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll derive from it. I'm confident you'll find it a valuable investment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,050,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $1,250,000 for it. This price still allows you a healthy profit margin.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
