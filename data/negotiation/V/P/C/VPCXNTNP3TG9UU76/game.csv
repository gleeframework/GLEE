"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll derive from it. I'm confident you'll find it a valuable investment.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,050,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $1,250,000 for it. This price still allows you a healthy profit margin.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
