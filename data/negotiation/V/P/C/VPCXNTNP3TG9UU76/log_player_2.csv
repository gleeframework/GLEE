"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll derive from it. I'm confident you'll find it a valuable investment.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,050,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $1,250,000 for it. This price still allows you a healthy profit margin.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
