Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing her profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant gain for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight for $15,000 might seem too aggressive and could make Bob walk away. This offer aims to be attractive while still assertive. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't need to desperately lowball Bob."
