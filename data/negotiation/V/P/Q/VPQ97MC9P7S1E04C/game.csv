"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider $850,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That being said, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $725,000 is too low for what this product offers. How about $780,000?  This is my final offer.",780000.0,Alice,5,
