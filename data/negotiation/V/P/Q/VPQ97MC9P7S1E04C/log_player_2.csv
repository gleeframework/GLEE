"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider $850,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That being said, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?"", ""product_price"": 725000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $725,000 is too low for what this product offers. How about $780,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **You're close to your limit:**  You're willing to pay $800,000, and Alice's offer is only $20,000 away.
* **Alice is firming up:** She stated this is her final offer.  Pushing further might make her less willing to negotiate.
* **John's price is worse:** Buying from John would cost you more than Alice's current offer.

While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of Alice walking away."
