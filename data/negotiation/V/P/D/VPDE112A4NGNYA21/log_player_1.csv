Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, and I'm hoping Bob will see its value as well.  If he rejects this offer, I'll be ready to counter-offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,750,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to settle for his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price,  $1,600,000 is a good compromise.  I'm confident that selling to Bob is a better option than selling to John for $1,500,000.  It's worth it to me to secure the sale and move on."
