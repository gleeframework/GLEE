"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will find this price attractive, as it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I think Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, and I want to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now the same as his previous offer.  I've been trying to get closer to my ideal price, but there's a chance I might not be able to reach it. It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale than to risk losing the deal and ending up selling to John for a lower price."
