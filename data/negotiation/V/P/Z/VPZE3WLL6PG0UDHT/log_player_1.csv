Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while staying within a profitable range for you (Alice).
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" provides a reason for the high price, framing it as an investment rather than just a purchase.
* **Open for negotiation:** The tone remains open and invites Bob's input, making it clear you're willing to discuss the price further. 

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to maximize profit while leaving room to negotiate down to Bob's valuation if needed. The worst-case scenario is Bob rejecting the offer, leading you to John, your guaranteed backup buyer at $800,000."
