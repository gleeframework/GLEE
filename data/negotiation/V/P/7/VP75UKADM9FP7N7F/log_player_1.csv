Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Value and Alternative:**  Knowing there's a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John creates a price floor for Alice. She doesn't need to go below that, and securing a deal with Bob quickly is preferable."
