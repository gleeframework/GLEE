"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love! It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

You can get the product from John for $80, which is less than Alice's offer of $110. It's always better to save money!"
