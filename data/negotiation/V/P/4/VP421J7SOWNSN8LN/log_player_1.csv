Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This leaves some room for negotiation while ensuring I get at least $120, my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob values the product enough to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll see if I can get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell for his initial price.  Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still better than what John would offer.  Given that Bob is willing to pay $135 and I've already rejected his lower offers, it seems likely that further negotiation won't lead to a significantly higher price. It's time to close the deal."
