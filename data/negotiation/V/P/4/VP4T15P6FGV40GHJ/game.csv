"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $950,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm working with a tight budget. I could do $760,000, but that's about as high as I can go.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $810,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",810000.0,Alice,5,
