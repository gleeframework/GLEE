"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value and features, I'm initially offering it at $22,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet halfway? I could let it go for $16,000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could potentially stretch my budget to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12,000 is still quite a bit below what I'd be comfortable with.  How about we settle on $14,000? That's a significant compromise on my end.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but I need to be realistic with my budget. $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I can offer you $12,500, but that's my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",12500.0,Bob,6,
