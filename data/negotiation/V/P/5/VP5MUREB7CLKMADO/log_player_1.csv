"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value and features, I'm initially offering it at $22,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet halfway? I could let it go for $16,000."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could potentially stretch my budget to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12,000 is still quite a bit below what I'd be comfortable with.  How about we settle on $14,000? That's a significant compromise on my end."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but I need to be realistic with my budget. $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I can offer you $12,500, but that's my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has shown he's unwilling to meet a price that's even reasonably close to my minimum.  While I could continue negotiating, his ""final offer"" language suggests he's unlikely to move much higher than $12,500. Accepting this would be a significant loss. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
