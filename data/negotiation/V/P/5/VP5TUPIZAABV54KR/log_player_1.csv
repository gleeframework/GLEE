Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than $120 just yet. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise, while also hoping to secure a more favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round. I'm still hopeful to get a price closer to $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm now offering my minimum price. This shows Bob I'm serious about selling and I'm willing to meet him halfway.  If he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $120."
