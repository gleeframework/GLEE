"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Could we settle around $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This feels like a fair price that acknowledges its value to both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,325,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
