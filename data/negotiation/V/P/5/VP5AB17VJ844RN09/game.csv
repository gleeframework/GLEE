"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $125? I'm really interested in the product and think this price is fair for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $125. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130. This feels like a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the sale.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $132. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",132.0,Alice,5,
