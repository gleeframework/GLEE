I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,750 is closer to my ideal price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $12,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I'd like to get closer to my original goal, the negotiations with Bob have gone on for too long and the price is still too low for me. I'm confident that John will be a good buyer and I'll get the best price for my product."
