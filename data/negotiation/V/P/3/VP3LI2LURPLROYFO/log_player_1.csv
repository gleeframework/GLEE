Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $120. I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will indicate how much he values the product. If he accepts, great! If he negotiates, you can then decide if you want to lower the price.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, so there's no risk of ending up empty-handed. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping in mind Bob's valuation and your fallback option."
