Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This would still be a profitable deal for you, and I'm sure we can find common ground.

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation,  I don't want to risk a prolonged negotiation and potentially lose the deal. I'll take John's offer and sell the product for $1,200,000."
