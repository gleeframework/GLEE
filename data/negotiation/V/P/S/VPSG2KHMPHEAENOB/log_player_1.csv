Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have significant interest from other parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**
    * Creates a sense of exclusivity and value.
    * Hints at other potential buyers (creating a sense of urgency).
* **Price:**
    *  $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion ($150,000) of the potential profit margin.
    *  Still leaves Bob with a perceived gain ($50,000) compared to his perceived value. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you anticipate Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start with a slightly higher price (e.g., $1,175,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Relationship Building:**  Even though you have a backup buyer, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob can be beneficial for future opportunities."
