"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for the value you'll receive. Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $8,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",8250.0,Alice,5,
