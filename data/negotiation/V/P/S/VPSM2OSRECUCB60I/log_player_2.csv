Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for the value you'll receive. Let me know if this works for you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $8,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,250. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed offer for $8,000 from John.  You'll save $250 by going with John."
