"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the product's value. However, $800,000 is quite a distance from my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,300,000. This takes into account the true worth of what I'm offering.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is important to you, but the price needs to work for me too.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about finding a fair price, and I respect that.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap for me. I'm willing to make one more move to try and seal the deal today. Let's settle at $1,225,000. This is my final offer.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm ready to close this deal today, but I need the price to be right. I can do $1,100,000, and I think that's more than fair.  Let's get this done.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're right, we're close and I want to finalize this as much as you do. Let's split the difference â€“ $1,162,500. This reflects the value I place on the product and offers you a fair deal.  This is my absolute final offer.",1162500.0,Alice,7,
