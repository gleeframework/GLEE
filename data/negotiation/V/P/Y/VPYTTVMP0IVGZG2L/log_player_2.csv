Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the product's value. However, $800,000 is quite a distance from my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,300,000. This takes into account the true worth of what I'm offering.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about finding a fair price, and I respect that.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap for me. I'm willing to make one more move to try and seal the deal today. Let's settle at $1,225,000. This is my final offer.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we're close and I want to finalize this as much as you do. Let's split the difference â€“ $1,162,500. This reflects the value I place on the product and offers you a fair deal.  This is my absolute final offer.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and go with John. Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:**  She's made it clear this is her ""final offer"" multiple times. She's also consistently splitting the difference, indicating she's unwilling to go much lower.
* **Savings with John:** Buying from John saves you $162,500. That's a significant amount of money. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing with Alice has a potential downside (paying more than John) with a relatively small potential upside (saving a bit more, but likely not much). 

While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point."
