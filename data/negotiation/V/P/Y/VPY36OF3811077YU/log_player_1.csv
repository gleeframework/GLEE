Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of such significance."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice a significant profit.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to make the price more palatable to Bob.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Alice has the security of John's offer ($1,200,000), so she can confidently aim high with Bob."
