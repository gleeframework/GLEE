"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a strong offer. This anchors the price in Bob's mind at a higher point. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Offering $950,000 leaves space for potential counteroffers and keeps Bob engaged in the negotiation process.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the high initial price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still being appealing enough for Bob to consider seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than our target price. We have room to negotiate and eight rounds left to try and bridge the gap. Accepting now would leave a considerable amount of potential profit on the table."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to move down to $920,000. This price reflects the true worth you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 920000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We are lowering our price to demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Smaller Concession:**  The decrease is smaller than Bob's, signaling we're not desperate and value the product highly.
* **Reiterate Value:**  We're reminding Bob of the product's benefits to justify the price.

By moving down but remaining firm, we aim to guide the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $885,000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** While $885,000 is a significant move from Bob, it remains below our desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiating Power:**  We're not yet in a desperate situation. We have time and another buyer as backup.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob's willingness to ""meet in the middle"" suggests he's open to going higher. 

We'll continue negotiating strategically, aiming to push the price closer to $900,000 or higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle at $900,000 even?  That reflects a fair deal for both of us considering the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Positioning:**  $900,000 is a strong psychological price point and a good balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By suggesting a firm ""even"" number, we subtly introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to decide quickly. 
* **Win-Win Framing:** The message emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit, making the offer more appealing.

We're now at a price where we're comfortable accepting, but leaving some room in case Bob decides to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $890,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it brings. Can we agree on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $890,000 is a very good offer. It's above our minimum acceptable price and demonstrates Bob's strong interest in the product. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Trying to squeeze out another $10,000 might not be worth the risk of Bob backing out, especially as we've reached round 6. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Prolonging negotiations means delaying the sale and potentially missing other opportunities.

Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
