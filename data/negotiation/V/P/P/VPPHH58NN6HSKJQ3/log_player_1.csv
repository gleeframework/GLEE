Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, meaning he would be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $8,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for anything less.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 aims to split the potential profit ($12,000 - $8,000 = $4,000) equally between you and Bob. This is a strong starting point for negotiation. 

By starting at $10,000, you leave room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still ensuring you make a significant profit above your minimum sale price."
