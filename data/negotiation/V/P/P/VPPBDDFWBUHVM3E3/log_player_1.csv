Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly is advantageous. 
* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,150,000 is a strong starting point, significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still leaving room for negotiation if needed.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  The message hints at another offer, creating a sense of urgency and scarcity to encourage Bob to act quickly."
