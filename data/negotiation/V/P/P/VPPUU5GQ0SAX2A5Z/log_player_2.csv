"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice, or you can proceed with your backup plan of buying from John."
