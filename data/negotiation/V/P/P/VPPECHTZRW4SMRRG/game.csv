"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and my desire to acquire it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and your desire to acquire it.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000, which I believe is a fair price considering your value for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
