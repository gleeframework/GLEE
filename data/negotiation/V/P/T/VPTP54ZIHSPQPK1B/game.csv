"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a substantial discount from my initial ask and reflects my desire to see this deal through with you.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $975,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm prepared to go up to $850,000.  I think this is a fair price, considering both of our positions. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,4,
