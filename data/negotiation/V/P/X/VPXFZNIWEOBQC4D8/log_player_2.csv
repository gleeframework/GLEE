Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After considering your latest offer, I am willing to accept $10900 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise between our positions and allows us to move forward with the transaction. I believe this is a beneficial deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is a significant discount from John's price of $12,000. This is a good deal for Bob, and while he could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll end up paying more.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price that's within his budget and significantly cheaper than John's."
