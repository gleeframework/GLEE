"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still higher than Bob's target of $1,200,000. Therefore, it's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but realistic:** Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming to push for a better deal. 
* **Justifies the price:** He provides a reason for his offer, mentioning the value Alice placed on the product and indicating that he's not just randomly throwing out numbers.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  He doesn't go all the way down to his own ideal price ($800,000), keeping a little wiggle room for bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on it, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has come down from her initial price, $825,000 is still above Bob's target of $1,200,000.
* **Opportunity to get a better price:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob can continue to push for a lower price and potentially get a better deal.
* **Risk of buying from John:** Buying from John at $1,200,000 would be a worse outcome than continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than where I can comfortably go. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a good starting point for us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splits the difference:**  Bob offers a price in the middle of his previous offer and Alice's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterates value:**  He reminds Alice of the value she placed on the product, further justifying his offer.
* **Finality:**  Bob emphasizes the ""good starting point"" for finalizing the deal, hinting at a desire to close the negotiation."
