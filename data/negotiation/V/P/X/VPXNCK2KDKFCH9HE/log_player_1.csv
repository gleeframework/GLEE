As we've discussed, it's worth $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a concession to get it into the right hands. I'm offering it to you for $900,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is certainly intriguing, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be more comfortable in the $700,000 range.  Would you be open to something closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
