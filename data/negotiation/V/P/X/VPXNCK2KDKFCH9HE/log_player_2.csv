"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, it's worth $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a concession to get it into the right hands. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I believe you won't find a better opportunity elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?
