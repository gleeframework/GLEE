"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, it's worth $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a concession to get it into the right hands. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I believe you won't find a better opportunity elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is certainly intriguing, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be more comfortable in the $700,000 range.  Would you be open to something closer to that?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $825,000 is closer, it's still a touch higher than what I had in mind. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
