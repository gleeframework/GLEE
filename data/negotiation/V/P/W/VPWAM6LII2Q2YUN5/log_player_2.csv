"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I know you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is much higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While this counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start low to get a sense of Alice's flexibility. 
* **Signaling Interest:**  The message emphasizes interest in the product but firmly establishes a lower budget.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting low, we aim to move the negotiation closer to our desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by stating this is her ""final offer.""  This doesn't mean it's truly her last price, but it's a way to apply pressure.
* **Above Budget:**  $10,000 is still more than you're willing to pay and matches the value Alice places on it, giving her no incentive to move further.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** We have the safety net of John's $8,000 offer. 

We'll reject her offer to see if we can negotiate further toward our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $7,500? I'm eager to make this work."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer splits the difference between her previous offer ($10,000) and our previous counteroffer ($6,000), but skews slightly in our favor. 
* **Show Willingness:** We want to signal that we're willing to move closer to her price, but not without significant movement on her part.
* **Urgency:** By expressing eagerness to make the deal, we maintain a positive tone while keeping the pressure on Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,500 is really pushing the lower limit of what I can accept. I'd be willing to let it go for $9,000. This is a very fair price considering the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concessions:**  Alice is moving slowly on price, only dropping $1,000 from her ""final offer."" This suggests there might be more room for negotiation.
* **Still Above John:**  $9,000 is still above John's offer. While it's getting closer to an acceptable range, we haven't exhausted our negotiating options yet.
* **Time Considerations:**  We are now past the halfway point of the rounds. Alice might be more willing to concede as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting close to what I can do. How about we settle at $8,500? That's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Pressure:** We are now just above John's offer, placing pressure on Alice. She needs to decide if losing the sale is worth holding out for a slightly higher price.
* **Sense of Finality:** By framing this as a price where ""we can both walk away happy,"" we're subtly introducing the idea that this might be our final offer.
* **Time Factor:**  With only a few rounds left, we need to push for a decision and signal that we have alternatives."
