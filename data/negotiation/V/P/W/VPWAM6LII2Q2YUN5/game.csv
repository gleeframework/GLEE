"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I know you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $7,500? I'm eager to make this work.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,500 is really pushing the lower limit of what I can accept. I'd be willing to let it go for $9,000. This is a very fair price considering the value you're getting.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting close to what I can do. How about we settle at $8,500? That's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy.",8500.0,Bob,6,
