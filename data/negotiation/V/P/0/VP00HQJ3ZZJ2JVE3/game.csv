"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I can meet you in the middle at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to consider your proposal, Bob, but I think $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I can do $11,250, and that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",11250.0,Alice,5,
