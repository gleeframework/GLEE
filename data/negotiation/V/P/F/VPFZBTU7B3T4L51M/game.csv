"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $22,000 is closer to its true value.  How about we meet halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
