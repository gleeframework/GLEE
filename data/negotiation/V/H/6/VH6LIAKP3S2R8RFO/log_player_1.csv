Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it to you at $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible (the price John will pay).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Understand Value:** While $800,000 is Bob's perceived value, he might be willing to pay a premium if he sees the product as unique or essential.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a strong opening offer and the potential for a successful sale to Bob."
