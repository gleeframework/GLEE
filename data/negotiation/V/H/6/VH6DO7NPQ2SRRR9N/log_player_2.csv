"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe holds great potential for you. I understand the value of this product to me is no less than $800000, but I'm willing to negotiate a price that might be mutually beneficial. I'm confident you'll find this product to be a significant asset, and I'm open to discussing a price that reflects its worth. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly better than John's.**  You're getting the product for $900,000, saving you $600,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Your goal is to save money.**  While you don't know Alice's exact value,  it's clearly less than yours (she's willing to sell for $900,000, while it's worth $1,500,000 to you). 
* **Accepting the offer is the best choice.** It allows you to acquire the product while maximizing your savings."
