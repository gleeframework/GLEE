"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while offering you a fair value. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is closer to your initial offer and allows me to make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
