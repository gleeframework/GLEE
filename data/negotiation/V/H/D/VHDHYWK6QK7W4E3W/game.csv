"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's still a great price for this fantastic product!",135.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so how about $132.50?",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I see your willingness to meet in the middle, and I'm happy to do the same.  Let's compromise at $133.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale. What do you say?",133.5,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget limitations.  Let's aim for a win-win.  I'm willing to come down to $133.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this out, I think we're very close!",133.0,Alice,7,
