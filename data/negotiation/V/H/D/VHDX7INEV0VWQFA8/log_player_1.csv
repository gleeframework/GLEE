Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,750,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, you have leverage to start high.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value, aiming to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer.  This lack of information on Bob's part works in your favor.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, and you'll get your guaranteed $1,500,000. However, the potential for a higher return is worth the calculated risk."
