"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly below its true worth. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $10,000. There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or explore other sellers before settling for her price."
