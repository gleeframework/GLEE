You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your ideal price point. You have room to negotiate and potentially get an even better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and explore a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $13,500?  I believe this price reflects the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider a compromise. How about we aim for a price of $14,000? This still represents a discount from the original price, while also allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is closer to your target price of $13,500. While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that you won't get much lower. Accepting her offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John and secures the product without further haggling."
