"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it allows for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and understand his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,900,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and his last offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price that might be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can do better. There are 6 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can secure a higher price.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,850,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping that this shows my flexibility while still maintaining a price that's worthwhile for me. With fewer rounds remaining, I'm aiming for a quick resolution that's close to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is significantly closer to my desired price than John's offer of $1,500,000.  With only four rounds remaining, I don't have time to continue negotiating and risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer secures a good profit while minimizing the risk of getting a lower price or running out of time."
