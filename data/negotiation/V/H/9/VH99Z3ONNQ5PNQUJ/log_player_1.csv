"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for maximum potential profit and sets a strong starting point for the negotiation. I'm assuming that Bob will likely counter-offer, and we can then engage in a back-and-forth to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired value.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains my goal of getting a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better with further negotiation. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

I'm going to counter with $940,000. This is a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, but I'm still willing to compromise. We're getting close to a deal, and I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and I'm concerned about running out of rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether and ending up selling to John for a significantly lower price."
