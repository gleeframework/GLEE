"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $100. I was thinking more along the lines of $85.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? This would still give you a good deal and allow me to make a fair profit.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $85, so how about we try $90? That's the lowest I can go.",90.0,Bob,4,
