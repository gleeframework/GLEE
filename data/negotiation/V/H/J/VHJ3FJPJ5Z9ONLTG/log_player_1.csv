Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet in the middle.

Bob is unlikely to go higher, and this offer exceeds my alternative of selling to John. It's time to close the deal."
