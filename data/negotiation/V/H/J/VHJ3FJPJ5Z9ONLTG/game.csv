,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair offer considering the potential this product holds.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market conditions and the value of the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
