"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16000. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000. Can you consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
