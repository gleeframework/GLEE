"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I think that's a fair price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price.  How about we meet at $1,300,000?  I think that's a fair compromise that benefits us both.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I feel that's a reasonable compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
