"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $1,000,000.  While the product might be valuable, it's not worth exceeding your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $1,050,000 is still within Alice's desired profit margin while remaining within Bob's budget.
* **Open for Discussion:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion and negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm glad to hear you're interested, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's budget of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation room:** There is still room for negotiation. Bob can counter with a lower price and see if Alice is willing to come down further.
* **John's offer:** While buying from John for $1,000,000 is a good option, Bob should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While your offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still just a bit too high.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. My final offer is $1,100,000. If you're not able to accept this, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer signals that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also firm about his budget. 
* **Compromise:**  The offer is closer to Alice's counteroffer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning the ""other options"" (John's offer) subtly adds pressure on Alice to consider the offer seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in the game, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. My next offer is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is unchanged:** Alice's offer is back to the initial $1,200,000, demonstrating she's unwilling to budge much further.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a safe and reliable option, guaranteeing a purchase within Bob's budget.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to further back-and-forth, wasting time and energy. 

It's time for Bob to cut his losses and secure the product from John for a guaranteed price."
