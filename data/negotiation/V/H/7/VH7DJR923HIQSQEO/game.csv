"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While your offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still just a bit too high.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. My final offer is $1,100,000. If you're not able to accept this, I'll need to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're still in the game, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. My next offer is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
