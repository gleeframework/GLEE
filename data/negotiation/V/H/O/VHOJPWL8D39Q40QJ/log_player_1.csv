Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still making a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space for both of you to find a price that works. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm confident that I can get a better price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let's split the difference."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
