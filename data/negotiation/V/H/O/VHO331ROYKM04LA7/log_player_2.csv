{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's final offer of $10,375 is still too high for Bob. He's only willing to pay up to $8,000. At this point, the negotiation has gone on for several rounds, and it's clear that Alice is not going to drop the price to a point that Bob is comfortable with.  Therefore, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $8,000. This ensures that he gets the product at his desired price and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
