Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price if he's particularly interested. 
* **High but Believable:**  While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it's not so outrageous that he'll immediately dismiss it.  The ""limited time"" message adds a sense of urgency. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects it, you still have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
