"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to making a decision, but I still think $11,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,000, which would be $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $10,750.  This is a fair price, and we can finalize the deal. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500 again, but this time I'm not budging further. Can you meet me at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,8,
