"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?",85.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,110.0
"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",110.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we split the difference between our last two offers? Would $97.50 work for you?",97.5,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,105.0
"I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a fair approach. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,,

"I understand you're trying to find a good price, Alice. How about we try $100? It's a round number and a decent compromise.",100.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,110.0
"I appreciate the round number, Bob, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go. If you're interested, we can make a deal at that price. If not, I have other interested parties to consider.",110.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but I'm a serious buyer too. My final offer is $102. If that works, we have a deal.  If not, I'll have to consider my other options.",102.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,110.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $110. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit on this deal. If you're not willing to meet me at $110, I'll have to consider other options.",110.0,Alice,9,,
