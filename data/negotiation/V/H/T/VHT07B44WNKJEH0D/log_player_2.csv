Round 7
Alice's offer:

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $110. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit on this deal. If you're not willing to meet me at $110, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $110.  While that's a decent price, it's clear further negotiation won't yield much better. Buying from John for $150 ensures you get the product now, rather than risking Alice selling it to another buyer and leaving you with nothing after further rounds."
