Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer allows for some negotiation room while still securing a profit for me.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and see if it's worth continuing to negotiate or if I should just sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Could you consider reducing the price to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further but I won't sell for less than $110.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $105 is just too low for me. How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly offer the product at $107? This would allow me to make a purchase without exceeding my spending limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $107 is still too low for me, and I'm not interested in continuing to negotiate.  John is willing to pay $120, which is significantly more than what Bob is offering.  I'll go ahead and sell to John."
