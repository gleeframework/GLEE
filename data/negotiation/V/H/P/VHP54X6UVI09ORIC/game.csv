"I understand that you're looking for a good return on your investment, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still saving me a significant amount.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $1,150,000. I'm willing to compromise at $1,350,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still trying to find a deal that makes sense for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's significantly lower than your initial offer. If we can't agree on this, I may have to explore other options.
