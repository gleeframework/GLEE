Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it aligns perfectly with your needs. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin for Alice.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Open to negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, Alice signals a willingness to negotiate, making a deal more likely. 
* **Backup plan:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John at $800,000.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while still maintaining a professional and persuasive approach with Bob."
