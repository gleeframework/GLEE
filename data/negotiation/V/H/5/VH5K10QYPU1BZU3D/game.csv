"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to $115. This price still gives me a reasonable profit, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product for you. Let's work together to find a solution.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $107? That seems like a fair compromise.",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $107 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $111? This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'd find the product to be worth every penny.",111.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more. How about $109? That's my final offer.",109.0,Bob,6,
