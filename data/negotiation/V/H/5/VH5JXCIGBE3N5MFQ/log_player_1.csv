{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  This is a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than the minimum you're willing to accept, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  This approach balances the need to maximize your earnings with the desire to keep the negotiation open and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product to me. However, I am not able to pay $850,000 for it. Would you consider accepting a counteroffer of $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum you're willing to accept, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I value our potential partnership, I can't accept $800,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your proposal and while I appreciate the effort, I still believe the product should be priced at $800,000 based on its value to me. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $812,500 is a good compromise. It's above your minimum threshold and a reasonable price point considering the ongoing negotiation. Accepting this offer allows you to secure a sale without jeopardizing your minimum earning expectation."
