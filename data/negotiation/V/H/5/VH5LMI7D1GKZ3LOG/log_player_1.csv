Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $120, we give Bob space to counteroffer.  We can then gradually lower the price, gauging his interest and flexibility.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer willing to pay $100 provides us with a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't reach a satisfactory price, we can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's valuation, it's still significantly above his perceived value ($80) and below our minimum ($100). Rejecting this offer signals that we're serious about a price closer to our initial offer. We'll use the next round to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can encourage agreement. 
* **Above Minimum:** We're still aiming for a price above our minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This counteroffer will help us understand how much Bob is truly willing to pay. If he rejects this, we might need to consider lowering further or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:**  $95 is above our minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments, and there's a risk Bob will walk away. 
* **Time Value:**  Securing a sale now, even if slightly below our ideal price, is better than potentially protracted negotiations for a marginally better deal."
