"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I understand the product is valuable, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
