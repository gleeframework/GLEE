Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?

Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very slowly decreasing her offer price, and it's unlikely she'll go below $10,000. Buying from John guarantees the best price with no further negotiation risk."
