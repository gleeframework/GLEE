Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a little to $110.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer again.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, and I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $105."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $109. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Alice's offer.  While I'd prefer to pay $107.50,  $109 is still a good deal and I don't want to risk losing out on the product by continuing to negotiate."
