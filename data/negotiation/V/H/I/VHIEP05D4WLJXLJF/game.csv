"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a little to $110.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $109. Let's try to close this deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
