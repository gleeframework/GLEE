"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high price. This product doesn't hold that much value for me.  I'd be willing to offer $500,000 to make this deal happen.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap between our valuations. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. Let me know if that works for you, otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 - this is a significant reduction and my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
