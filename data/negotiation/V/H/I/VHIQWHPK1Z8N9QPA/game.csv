"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is a good middle ground, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this unique product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can reach a deal if we meet in the middle.  How about $10,500? This would allow both of us to get a fair price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $13,000. How about we meet at $12,750? This way, I can still make a profit, and you'll get a great deal on the product.",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,750 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's try to close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my target price.  I'm willing to go up to $11,250. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal and both walk away happy.",11250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. This is my last chance to get a good deal, and I'm counting on you to meet me halfway. Let's make a deal!",12000.0,Alice,9,
