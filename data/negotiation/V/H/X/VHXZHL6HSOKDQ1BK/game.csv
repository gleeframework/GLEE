"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still allows for a good profit margin for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product worthwhile. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,750? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8,750 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $8,900? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,750. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? I'm willing to make a final compromise to get the deal done.",8800.0,Bob,6,
