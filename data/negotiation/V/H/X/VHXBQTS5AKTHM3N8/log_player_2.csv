"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still within the range where further negotiation could be beneficial. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially if she's eager to sell.  Rejecting the offer allows for exploring that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts with a significant drop from Alice's initial price, aiming to test her willingness to negotiate.  It's a bold move, but it's justified by the goal of saving as much money as possible. If Alice rejects this offer, we can still move higher without exceeding our $1,500,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a significant improvement over her initial offer.  It's also a good deal compared to buying from John at $1,500,000.  Further negotiation might save a few more dollars, but the risk of Alice walking away or needing to buy from John outweighs the potential savings. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and a quick transaction."
