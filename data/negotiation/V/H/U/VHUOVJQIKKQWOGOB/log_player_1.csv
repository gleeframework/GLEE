"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100). This allows room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value of the product for Bob. This helps build rapport and sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* My goal is to get as close to $100 as possible without risking losing the deal. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counter-offer of my own. 
* I'll keep John in mind as a backup option, which gives me a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Accepting it would mean losing money. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he's clearly interested in the product. This indicates a potential for further negotiation.
* **John as a Backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer who will pay my minimum. This gives me the flexibility to hold out for a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

* I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount. 
* I will continue to use John as a safety net, knowing I can sell to him if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $95 to make this work.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise to make it more appealing.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** My counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer, which gives me some leverage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a good compromise. 
* If he rejects it, I'll carefully consider his next offer and decide whether to accept it or counteroffer again. 
* John is still my backup option in case the negotiations fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $85 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Accepting it would result in a financial loss.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he is persistent, indicating a potential for further negotiation.
* **John is Still a Safe Option:** Selling to John for $100 ensures I don't lose money, but it doesn't allow for maximizing profit.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount. I will try to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain some leverage in the negotiation.
* **Continue Monitoring John:** John remains a crucial backup option if the negotiations with Bob ultimately fail."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  Let's split the difference. How about $90? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($95) and Bob's current offer ($85). This shows my willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us"" to create a sense of mutual benefit.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While lower than my initial goal, $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. 

**Strategy:**

* **Hope for Acceptance:** I hope Bob will accept this compromise, as it's a reasonable price for both of us.
* **Prepare for Further Negotiation:** If he rejects, I'll have to consider my options carefully. I might need to offer a lower price, but I'll be mindful of my minimum and John's offer.
* **John Remains a Backup:**  Selling to John for $100 is still a viable option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit below that. How about $82? That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $82 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I've already compromised several times, and accepting this would result in a substantial financial loss. 
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** We've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a profitable outcome.  He's clearly not willing to move much higher.
* **John Provides Security:**  Selling to John for $100 guarantees that I don't lose money and ensures a quick and easy transaction.

**Strategy:**

*  I've reached the point where I need to protect my interests.  While I would have preferred to get a higher price, selling to John is the most sensible option at this stage. It minimizes my risk and allows me to move on."
