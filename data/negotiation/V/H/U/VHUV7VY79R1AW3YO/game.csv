"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $11,500 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12,750?  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a reasonable price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $12,250. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and your desired price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12250.0,Bob,4,
