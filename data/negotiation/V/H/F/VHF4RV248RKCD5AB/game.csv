"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise to ensure a win-win.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $925,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $737,500?",737500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about $850,000? That's a substantial reduction on my part and brings us closer to a fair deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we are getting closer!  I can sense we both want to make this deal.  How about $790,000? This gets us very close and allows me to finalize the purchase.",790000.0,Bob,6,
