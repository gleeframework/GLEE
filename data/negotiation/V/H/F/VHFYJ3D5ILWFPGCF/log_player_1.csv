{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with my desired price of $15,000. This sets the stage and gives Bob a starting point for negotiations.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value to Bob, emphasizing the potential for him to gain $5,000 in value. 
* **Open Ended:** This message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for a potential negotiation.

**Remember:** My goal is to maximize my earnings, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is fair considering the value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at a significant loss. 

I will counter-offer Bob in the next round, aiming to find a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is my final offer. This price still gives you a significant value gain, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counter-offer of $12,500, which is a $2,500 increase from Bob's offer but still below my initial asking price. This shows a willingness to compromise while staying within my acceptable range.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm again emphasizing the value Bob will gain by purchasing at this price. 
* **Finality:** I'm signaling that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to either accept or move on.  

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while still maximizing my earnings. If Bob doesn't accept, I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still provides you a good profit. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I've already made a significant compromise by dropping from $15,000 to $12,500, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer.  

Rather than continue haggling with Bob, I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000. This ensures I reach my desired price and avoid any further risk of a lower sale."
