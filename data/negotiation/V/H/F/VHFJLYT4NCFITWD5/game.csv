"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not quite there. I'm thinking more along the lines of $725,000. It's a small increase, but it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
