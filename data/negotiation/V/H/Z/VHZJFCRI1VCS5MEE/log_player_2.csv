(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a decent price, it's still above your maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, and you can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable range for both of us. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me halfway to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get closer to my target price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $10,750. This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is just slightly above my maximum budget, but it's close enough to make it worthwhile to accept. I'm confident that I can save the extra $900 if I continue negotiating, but the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer or me reaching the 10-round limit is high. 

I'm choosing to accept the offer and secure the product, recognizing that it's a good deal overall considering the circumstances."
