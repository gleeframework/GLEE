"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $180 is my bottom line. This product is in high demand, and I'm confident I can get that price elsewhere.  Is there any wiggle room in your budget? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is firm on her price and it's clear she won't budge. Since you can get the product for your maximum price from John, there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
