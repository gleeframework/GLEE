"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for your consideration. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your holdings. My initial price is $1,750,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price within the next few rounds.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,750,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,450,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $1,450,000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,550,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
