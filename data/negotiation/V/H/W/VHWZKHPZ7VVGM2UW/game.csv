"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product.  This would provide a good profit margin for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair price.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that will allow both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?",975000.0,Bob,4,
