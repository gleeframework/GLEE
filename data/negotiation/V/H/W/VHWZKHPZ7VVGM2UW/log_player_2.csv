"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's desired price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product.  This would provide a good profit margin for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate a lower price.  Bob can also consider the fact that he can always buy the product from John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that will allow both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1,015,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to earn a decent profit, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still not willing to drop below $1,000,000, which is Bob's target price.  At this point, it makes more sense for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This guarantees that Bob gets the product at his desired price and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
