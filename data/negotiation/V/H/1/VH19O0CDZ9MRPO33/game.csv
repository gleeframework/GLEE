"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $17,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $18,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.",18000.0,Alice,5,
