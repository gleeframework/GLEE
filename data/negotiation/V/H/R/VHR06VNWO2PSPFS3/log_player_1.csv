{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a unique and valuable asset that I believe will be of great benefit to your company.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, giving you room to negotiate.  It's also a strong opening offer that demonstrates your confidence in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 right now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is your minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is at the very bottom of your range. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is certainly a starting point, I'm looking for a bit more to justify the value it offers. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price still reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from owning this product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $850000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise and gets you closer to your desired price.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal altogether to John outweighs the potential gain of a slightly higher price."
