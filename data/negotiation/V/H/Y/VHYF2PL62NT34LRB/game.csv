"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm happy to consider a price of $1000000. This allows both of us to make a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm happy to continue working towards a deal.  However, I'm still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's try $1025000. This would be a solid deal for both of us, and allows us to close the deal quickly.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're still in negotiations. I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest counteroffer. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the effort to find common ground.  I'm closer than ever to making a decision.  However, I'm still at $1025000. It's a significant saving for me, and allows us to finalise the deal in this round. ",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to the sweet spot, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1075000 again, but this time, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that will enhance the product's value even further. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
