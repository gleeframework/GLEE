{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but below your minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also incentivizes him to accept the offer. 

It's important to be flexible and ready to counter-offer if Bob rejects the initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,800 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,800 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that's too far below my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but unfortunately, $8,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $9,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I still believe we can reach an agreement within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,700 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to continue negotiating with him, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price."
