I'll reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $87 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $89.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 89} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer $89, I don't want to risk losing the deal and getting only $80 from John.  $88 is a good compromise and close to my desired price."
