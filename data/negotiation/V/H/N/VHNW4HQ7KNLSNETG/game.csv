"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This still leaves you with significant room to profit from this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my budget. How about $950,000? I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $950,000 still doesn't reflect the value of this product.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay $975,000, which is a fair price considering the value I see in this product. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $975,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my goal.  How about $1,025,000? It's a fair compromise and a good opportunity for you to invest in a valuable product.  Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $992,500? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",992500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but I still need a little more to make this deal work for me. How about $1,010,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves you with room to profit. Let's make this happen.",1010000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to get any closer to your price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,005,000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere for a better deal. This is my final offer.",1005000.0,Bob,10,
