"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming for a high price initially, recognizing that Bob values the product at $150. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price gives us a good buffer for potential negotiation and allows me to adjust the price depending on Bob's reaction.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message establishes a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price by negotiating further with Bob. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my initial price and his offer. 
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making it more likely he'll see the value in my counteroffer.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $105 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, ensuring I'm not losing out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about $97? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $97 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Progress in Negotiations:**  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer. It's likely further negotiation won't get me a significantly higher price.
* **Time Constraint:** We're already in round 4, and the deal could fall through if I keep rejecting offers.

It's a good deal for me considering the time constraint and the potential risk of getting a worse offer later."
