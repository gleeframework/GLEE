"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price. I still have 8 rounds left and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $16,500. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum value, and I'm already four rounds in. I've lost valuable time trying to negotiate with him. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000. This ensures I don't lose any money and I can move on to other opportunities."
