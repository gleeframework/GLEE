# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get a better price from John ($1,000,000). Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to pursue this more favorable deal."
