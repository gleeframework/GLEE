"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $11,000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is a great fit for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. $10,200 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $9,850?",9850.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9,850, Bob. I think $10,200 is a fair price for this product, and I'm not willing to give up on that much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $9,850, which would be $10,025. This is my final offer. What do you think?",10025.0,Alice,7,
