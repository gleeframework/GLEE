"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1100000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be highly valuable to you. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product holds. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. Can you meet me in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price is still within the range of what you said you're willing to pay, and it's the final offer I can make. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $975000. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,6,
