"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm asking for $140, which is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $135? It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $135 is still higher than the value she places on the product. I'm confident that I can continue negotiating and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
