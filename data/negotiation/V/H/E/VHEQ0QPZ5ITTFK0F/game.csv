"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $135? It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",132.5,Bob,4,
