"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire this unique product for a price that I believe represents a significant value for you. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This offer provides you with a considerable return on your investment while also allowing me to achieve a favorable outcome. Please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than your maximum price, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. By rejecting her offer, you can leverage John's lower price to potentially negotiate a better deal with Alice or proceed with purchasing from John at a $50,000 savings."
