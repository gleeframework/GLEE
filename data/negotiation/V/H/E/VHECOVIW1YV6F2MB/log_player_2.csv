"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,500 isn't a terrible price, there's a good chance you can get a better deal. Alice is starting higher than her product's worth to her ($12,000). By rejecting this offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price closer to her valuation."
