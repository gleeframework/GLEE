"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $115 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!",95.0,Bob,4,
