"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal. He can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $10,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal goal. He's willing to negotiate further and see if he can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference at $10,750.  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $10,750 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  How about we meet at $11,250?  That's only $500 more than your offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.  Let's wrap this up and finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get a better price. While $11,250 is tempting, he believes he can still push for a slightly lower price. He wants to maintain the momentum of the negotiation and see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $11,250 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and I think we're very close to a deal.  How about $11,100?  That's only $100 more than your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.  If we don't reach an agreement soon, I'll have to consider selling to John for $15,000, which would be a better deal for me.  Let's close this now and make sure we both come away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,100 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, he's running out of rounds. Alice's mention of selling to John for $15,000 suggests she's not willing to budge much further.  At this point, Bob realizes he's unlikely to get a significantly better price from Alice. It's more advantageous for him to buy the product from John for $8,000 and secure the best possible deal within his budget."
