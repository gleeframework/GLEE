"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $10,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference at $10,750.  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to finalize the transaction.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $10,750 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  How about we meet at $11,250?  That's only $500 more than your offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.  Let's wrap this up and finalize the deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $11,250 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal now.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and I think we're very close to a deal.  How about $11,100?  That's only $100 more than your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.  If we don't reach an agreement soon, I'll have to consider selling to John for $15,000, which would be a better deal for me.  Let's close this now and make sure we both come away happy.",11100.0,Alice,7,
