"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product from John for $10,000, so there's no reason to pay more. By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

You should reject Alice's offer. Even though it's lower than her initial offer, you can still get the product from John for $10,000.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice, potentially getting closer to your desired price."
