"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we negotiate, I'd like to start with an offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $775,000? This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a reasonable profit while also recognizing your interest in the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. How about we meet at $725,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

At $725,000, Alice is approaching her likely lower limit (remember her product is worth $800,000 to her). Continuing to push could make Alice walk away, forcing you to buy from John at the much higher price. Accepting at $725,000 secures a significant discount from both John's price and Alice's initial offer."
