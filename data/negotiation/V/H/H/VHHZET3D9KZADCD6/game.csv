"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is already a competitive price for this product and its value.  I could meet you halfway at $10,500, which is a generous offer considering its worth to you. This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $9,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
