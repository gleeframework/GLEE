Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand your enthusiasm for it, but I believe we can find a more suitable price. Considering my budget, I would like to propose an offer of $12000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get a better price. While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll try to counter with something closer to my desired amount in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $15,000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product. "", ""product_price"": 15000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to get something a bit higher. I'll try to counter with a price closer to $15,000 in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $13,000 isn't quite enough for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $14,000?  It's a fair price that shows I'm willing to compromise. "", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in finding a middle ground, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $13500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, this is a good compromise and it's getting close to my ideal price.  I'm also concerned that if I keep rejecting, Bob may walk away or I might run out of time. $13,500 is a better deal than what I'd get from John."
