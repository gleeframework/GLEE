Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I can go as low as $1,800,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what's being offered.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm willing to consider  $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have a guaranteed buyer at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Alice is unwilling to budge significantly from her valuation. While she came down to $1,500,000, that's still considerably more than your $800,000 limit and John's offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge that gap."
