"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I can go as low as $1,800,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still much higher than I'm willing to pay. If you're serious about selling, I could go up to $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm willing to consider  $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have a guaranteed buyer at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
