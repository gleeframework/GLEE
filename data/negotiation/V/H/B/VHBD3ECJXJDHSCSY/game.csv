"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. Is this a price you're comfortable with?",900000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, I'm looking to acquire it for a price closer to $850,000.  This would be a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm now offering the product to you for $920,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $885,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still saving me money compared to John's offer.",885000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, $885,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'm counteroffering at $910,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product. What do you think?",910000.0,Alice,5,,
