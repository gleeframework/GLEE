Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point, as it's still higher than what the product is worth to him, but it also leaves room for negotiation. It also keeps me closer to my minimum price of $12,000, just in case Bob rejects my offer and I have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, but it's closer to what I want. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a compromise that brings me closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and at this point, I'm getting tired of the back-and-forth.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so I'll take that option."
