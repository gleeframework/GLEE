"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the pricing. While $800000 is a fair starting point, I believe the product's true value justifies a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $950000. This price reflects both the product's potential and the fact that I'm eager to see it in your hands.",950000.0,Alice,3,
