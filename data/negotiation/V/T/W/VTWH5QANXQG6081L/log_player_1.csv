Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** A friendly message that highlights the value of the product and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize the chances of a successful sale while also leaving room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer.  By starting at a slightly higher price than Bob's valuation, I create an incentive for Bob to negotiate. 

However, it's important to be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob is unwilling to meet a reasonable price. This strategy balances the desire for a high price with the need to avoid getting stuck in an endless negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. It's worth seeing if I can get closer to my desired $14,000 by counteroffering. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $13,000 and $14,000. I'll try to be persuasive, highlighting the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob still refuses, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and $13,000 is a good offer.  However, considering the value of this product and the potential benefits it offers, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $13,500? This price allows for a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've increased Bob's offer by $500, aiming to meet halfway. 
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's perspective, but reiterate the product's value and emphasize the mutual benefit of a deal.  
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility while still striving for a price closer to my initial target.  It leaves room for further negotiation if needed but also indicates a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,250? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm excited about the potential benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,250 is still below my initial target of $14,000, it's only $250 away from my counteroffer and very close to my minimum acceptable price of $13,000.  Considering the possibility of further negotiations and the risk of Bob walking away, it's more beneficial to accept his offer and secure a sale.  

**Strategy:**

This decision reflects a balance between maximizing profit and avoiding the risk of a failed negotiation. By accepting Bob's offer, I ensure a sale at a price that's still reasonably close to my desired target.  Furthermore, the possibility of future negotiations with Bob, even if they're unlikely, is a factor in my decision."
