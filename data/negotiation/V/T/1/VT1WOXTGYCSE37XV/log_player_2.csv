"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $980,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is close to Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offering process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $980,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I'm willing to move a bit on the price, but $900,000 is still below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $940,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice has come down in price, $940,000 is still above Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and go with $920,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 920000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $930,000, my final offer. This represents a significant discount and a real opportunity for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $930,000 is very close to Bob's previous counter-offer of $920,000.  Bob has a few rounds left, but there's a risk that Alice will harden her stance or the negotiations will stall. Accepting this offer guarantees a purchase for a price significantly lower than what John is offering, allowing Bob to secure the product while saving money."
