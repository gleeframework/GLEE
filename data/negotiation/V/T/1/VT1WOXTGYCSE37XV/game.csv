"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $980,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I'm willing to move a bit on the price, but $900,000 is still below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $940,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",940000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and go with $920,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a mutually beneficial deal.",920000.0,Bob,4,
