"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay a price closer to my ideal value, but I'm leaving room for him to counter so we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get closer to my desired price. Hopefully, Bob will accept, but if not, we can continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a little lower than I'd prefer, it's within a reasonable range and higher than what John would pay.  I'm also mindful of the time constraint - we're already halfway through the rounds.  It's better to secure a good price than risk losing the deal and settling for John's offer."
