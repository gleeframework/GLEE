"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John.  $130 is a good starting point, but I'm sure I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. It's still a great deal for you considering the product's worth to you. Let's try to close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$125 is a good price considering my limit is $150 and Alice is willing to come down from her initial offer. I'm happy to close the deal here."
