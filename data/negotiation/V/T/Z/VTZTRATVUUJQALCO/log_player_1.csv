"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $100, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you're willing to be flexible and  gives Bob a reason to consider your offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. It's still a great deal for you considering the product's worth to you. Let's try to close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
