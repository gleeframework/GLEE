,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1050000. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1025000? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1000000. How about we meet at $1015000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",1015000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get at least $1005000. I'm thinking we can meet at $1010000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1010000.0,Alice,9,
