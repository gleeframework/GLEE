"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $9,500 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? I believe that's a fair price that would be mutually beneficial.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $8,200? I believe this is a fair price that takes into account both our interests.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
