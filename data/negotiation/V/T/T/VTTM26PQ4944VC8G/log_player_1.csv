``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation, but it's also below the $15,000 value Bob places on the product, giving him an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product for $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still worth trying to push for a higher price. You can likely get closer to your desired price with a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $14,000. This is a great price for you, and it still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's try to reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price range and significantly better than selling to John.  It's time to close the deal."
