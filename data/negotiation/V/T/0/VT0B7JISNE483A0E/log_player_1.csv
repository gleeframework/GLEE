Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [Product Name] that I think you'd be interested in. It's in excellent condition and I'm offering it to you for [Your Price].  Let me know what you think! If you're not interested, no worries, I have another buyer lined up."", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  The message is friendly and casual, aiming to pique Bob's interest while also making it clear that you're open to negotiation. It also subtly mentions the backup buyer to create a sense of urgency. 
* **Product Price:** The price is set at $175, which is higher than your minimum of $150. This gives you some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still being open to a negotiation. You start with a higher price, but you're prepared to accept John's offer if Bob rejects. By mentioning John, you're creating a sense of competition that might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
