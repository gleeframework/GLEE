Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, $8,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice is not budging much and it's unlikely she'll go below $10,000.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John at your target price."
