"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $1,050,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still slightly out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,060,000, which is a fair compromise. This price allows us both to achieve our desired outcomes.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,065,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1065000.0,Alice,5,
