Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This offer reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,300,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This reflects a substantial compromise on my part and demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's still far below the product's value to you and what John is willing to pay. It's unlikely Bob will dramatically increase his offer in the remaining rounds to a point where it makes sense to continue negotiating.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price."
