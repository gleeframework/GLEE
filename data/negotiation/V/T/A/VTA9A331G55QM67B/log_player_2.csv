"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price:** You're aiming to get the product for under $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is at $950,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** You have room to negotiate a lower price, as Alice values the product at $800,000. 
* **The risk of buying from John:** Buying from John would cost you $1,000,000, which is not ideal. 

**Next Steps:**  You should make a counteroffer to Alice.  Start with a price lower than $950,000 but higher than Alice's value of $800,000 to see if you can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $875,000, which reflects a fair value for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point, falling between your target price ($1,000,000) and Alice's value ($800,000).
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** The message conveys your interest in the product but also your desire to find a price that works for both parties. 
* **Room for compromise:**  If Alice rejects this offer, you can continue to negotiate by increasing your counteroffer slightly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $910,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above target:** Alice's new offer of $910,000 is still above your target of $1,000,000.
* **Room for further negotiation:** While Alice has shown some flexibility, there's still potential for a price closer to your target.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Buying from John at $1,000,000 would be a last resort, as it's important to save money if possible. 

**Next Steps:** 
You should continue to negotiate with Alice. You can counteroffer with a price between her offer of $910,000 and your previous offer of $875,000. This will show you're still interested but also trying to find a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $910,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $890,000. This would be a fair price that allows for a successful transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a middle ground:** This counteroffer is exactly in the middle of Alice's offer ($910,000) and your previous offer ($875,000).
* **Show commitment to negotiating:** By meeting Alice halfway, you demonstrate your serious interest in acquiring the product while still advocating for a price closer to your target.
* **Preparing for potential rejection:** If Alice rejects this offer, you can still increase your offer slightly (to around $900,000), but you're getting closer to the point where buying from John might be the better option."
