"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a great price, considering the value it will bring to your life. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```tool_code
Reason:While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, it's still more than John's offer of $15,000. Bob's goal is to save money, so rejecting Alice's offer and going with John's offer makes the most sense.
