"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

You're trying to buy the product for the lowest price possible. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer means you can buy the product from John for $800,000, saving you $400,000."
