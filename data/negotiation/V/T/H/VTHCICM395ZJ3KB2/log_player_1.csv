{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  While $7,500 is better than my minimum, I believe there's potential to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $7,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $8,750?  I'm confident this is a fair price, and it gives you a chance to acquire a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7250. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with it.  I think there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $7,250 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than $8,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  We've reached a point where it seems like Bob isn't willing to budge much further, and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, I'll lose him as a buyer completely.  Selling to John guarantees me a good price and keeps me from further risking losing out on a sale."
