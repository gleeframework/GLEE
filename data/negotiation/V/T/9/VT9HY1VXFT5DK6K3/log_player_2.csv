"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is less than John's price, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to Alice's value of $12,000 as possible without risking losing the deal. Offering $12,500 represents a reasonable compromise and leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, but still below the price Bob would pay from John.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. While $12,500 was rejected, Alice is willing to negotiate.  $13,000 is a compromise between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous counteroffer. It increases the chance of Alice accepting while still giving Bob a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is now lower than Bob's previous counteroffer of $13,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, this is a good deal for him. It's significantly lower than John's price and likely close to Alice's minimum.  It's time to accept the deal and secure the product."
