"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us.  You'll get a valuable product for a great price, and I'll be able to close the deal quickly.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and John's offer. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or proceeding to buy from John at a much better price."
