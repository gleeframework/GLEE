(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price you're willing to pay from John. There's room for negotiation. It makes sense to reject her offer and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within the range I'm willing to pay. This gives me some room to negotiate further and hopefully reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $850,000 is still higher than what I'd like to pay.  I'm going to try and negotiate further and see if I can get her down to a price closer to my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $750,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still aiming for a price lower than her last offer.  It's a reasonable compromise that hopefully encourages her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and her offer of $825,000 is within my acceptable range. It's still a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
