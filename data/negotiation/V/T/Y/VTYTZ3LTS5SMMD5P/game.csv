"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price still allows you a significant profit while giving me a fair return on my investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1,250,000. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
