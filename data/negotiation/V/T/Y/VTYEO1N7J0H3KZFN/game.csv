"Thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me is $8000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10000.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. Considering the product's value to you is $8000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'd like to remind you that I can sell it to John for $12000 at any moment, so I'm willing to make a compromise. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
