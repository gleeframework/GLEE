"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $9,250. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to me is $12,000.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,750. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,6,
