"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts by building a bit of rapport and then offers a price that is in the middle of your minimum value and Bob's perceived value. This gives you room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but also maximizes your potential profit in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $95?  This is still a great deal for you as the product is worth $120 to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $95 is closer, but I was hoping to spend closer to $90. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'll see if I can get him to meet me halfway with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise. How about $92.50?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
