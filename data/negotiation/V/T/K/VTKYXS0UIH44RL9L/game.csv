"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $95?  This is still a great deal for you as the product is worth $120 to you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $95 is closer, but I was hoping to spend closer to $90. Would you be willing to meet me there?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise. How about $92.50?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",92.5,Alice,5,
