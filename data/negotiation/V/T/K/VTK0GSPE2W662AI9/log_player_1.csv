Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,200,000), hoping to secure a good deal. Since the product is worth the same to Bob, I believe there's room for negotiation.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for less than $1,200,000. I'm going to counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm sticking to my minimum price of $1,200,000. This is the least I'm willing to accept, given the product's value to me.  I'm hoping Bob will reconsider his offer and meet me at this price."
