"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. It's a steal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than her perceived value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80 and the guaranteed price of $80 from John.  You can do better by rejecting this offer."
