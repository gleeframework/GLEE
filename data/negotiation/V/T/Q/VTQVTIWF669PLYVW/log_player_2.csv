"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially much more than $1200000. I'm willing to part with it for a price that I believe is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  I'm proposing a price of $1500000.  This reflects the value I place on the product, while also allowing for room for negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
