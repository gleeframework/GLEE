"Hi Alice, $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price considering we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a little too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. That's a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product. Let's close this deal, what do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $10,250 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $9,750 for the product. It's a fair price considering we're both trying to meet in the middle.  Let's close this deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise.  I'm ready to meet you in the middle.  Let's close this deal at $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,875. This is a fair price, considering the negotiations we've had. Let's close this deal and call it a day.",9875.0,Bob,8,
