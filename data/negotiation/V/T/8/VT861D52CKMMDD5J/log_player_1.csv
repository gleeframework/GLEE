Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, your goal is to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price close to your minimum ($150) allows room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
 
While Bob only values the product at $80, there's a chance he might be willing to pay slightly more if he perceives the deal as valuable. This strategy aims to test that possibility."
