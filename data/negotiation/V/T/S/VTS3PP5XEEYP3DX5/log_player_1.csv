"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot, so I'm starting with a price of $180.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to maximize potential profit. I know the product is worth at least $120 to me, so $180 leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** I'm not setting a hard price, but rather presenting an initial offer. This allows for negotiation and encourages Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is showing interest, $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Testing Bob's limits:** By rejecting his offer, I can gauge his true interest level and see how far he's willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your interest! $130 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down to $150. It's a great deal for such an amazing product! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $180 to $150, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the good deal he's getting. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $150 is still above my minimum price of $120, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
