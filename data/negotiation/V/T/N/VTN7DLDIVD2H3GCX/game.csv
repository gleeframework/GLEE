"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price reflects the product's true worth and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from the $1,400,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer, this time at $1,250,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the value I see in the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for us both, $1,250,000 is still below my acceptable threshold.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,200,000.  So my final offer is $1,325,000. This provides you considerable savings compared to the other offer, and it ensures the product finds a good home.  What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your transparency and willingness to work with me. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is the highest price I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
