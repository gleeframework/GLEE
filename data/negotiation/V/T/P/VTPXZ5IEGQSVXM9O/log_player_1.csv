This is a starting point for negotiation. I'm offering the product at $15,000, knowing it's worth at least $10,000 to me. This allows room for negotiation, but also ensures I get a good return. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,500. This is a compromise that's closer to my initial asking price but still shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $13,000 is a good deal and is significantly better than selling to John for $10,000.  It's time to close the deal."
