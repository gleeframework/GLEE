"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While I do think it's a valuable product, $1,300,000 is still a bit much for me.  How about we settle at $1,225,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,250,000? I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
