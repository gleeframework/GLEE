**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's also signaled that $1,250,000 is close to her bottom line.  While we might be able to squeeze out a few thousand more, it's getting risky.  Accepting at $1,250,000 secures a significant savings over John's offer ($250,000) and avoids the risk of Alice walking away from the deal."
