"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is the lowest I can go without compromising the value of the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is very close to what I had budgeted for this.  If you're willing to come down just a bit more, I think we can close this deal. What about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
