"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my value. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm not happy with the current situation, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm confident I can get a better price, and selling to John for $1,500,000 is still an option if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable value. This is a compromise, but it's still a good price for Bob considering his value of $1,000,000.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in this deal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough. I'm confident I can get a better deal through further negotiations.  However, I'm starting to consider the possibility of selling to John if things don't improve quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,400,000. This is another compromise, but I'm still within my acceptable range. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good deal for him and accept. If not, I'm still prepared to continue negotiating, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating, we're getting closer to the end of the rounds.  $1,300,000 is a good price for me considering Bob's value, and it's getting closer to the point where selling to John might be a better option. It's time to take the deal and avoid risking losing out entirely."
