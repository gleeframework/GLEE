"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000.  I believe that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to reach a fair deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing your eagerness to make a deal, and I appreciate that. Let's bridge this gap. I'm proposing $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
