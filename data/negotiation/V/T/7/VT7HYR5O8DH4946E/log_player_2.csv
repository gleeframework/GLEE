Round 2

Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your eagerness to make a deal, and I appreciate that. Let's bridge this gap. I'm proposing $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.

You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her ""final offer"" of $1,000,000. This matches what John is willing to sell the product for. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice since there's no room for her to lower the price further. You can get the same price from John without the risk of further negotiation."
