"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000.  I believe that's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to reach a fair deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below the product's value to both of us.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if we can bridge the gap significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing your eagerness to make a deal, and I appreciate that. Let's bridge this gap. I'm proposing $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to send a strong signal to Bob. By dropping to our minimum acceptable price and stating it's our final offer, we create a sense of urgency. Bob is getting a good deal, and this might be the push he needs to finalize the purchase."
