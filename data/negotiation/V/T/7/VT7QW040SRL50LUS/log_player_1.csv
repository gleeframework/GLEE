Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties (John) adds a time pressure element, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
