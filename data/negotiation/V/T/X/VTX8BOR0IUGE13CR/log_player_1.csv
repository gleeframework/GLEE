Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still want to try to get a better price.  I have 8 rounds left and can still sell to John for $80 if I need to."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although I'd prefer more, I'm running out of rounds and I'm happy to close the deal at $87. It's only $3 less than John's offer and still above my minimum."
