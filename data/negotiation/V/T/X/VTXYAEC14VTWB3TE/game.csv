"I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $105. Would you be willing to go down to $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $102, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $102. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $102, which would be $91. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",91.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $91. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $102 and $91, which would be $96.5. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make it work.",96.5,Alice,7,
