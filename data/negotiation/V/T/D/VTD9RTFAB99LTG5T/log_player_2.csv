"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to sell you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

This offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford up to $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm beginning with a significantly lower offer ($60) than my actual maximum budget ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of getting a better deal. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** By starting low, I signal to Alice that I'm serious about buying but need a more competitive price. This encourages her to counteroffer and potentially meet me closer to my budget. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I always have the option to go with John for $80, so I'm not desperate to accept a price significantly higher than that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $100 is still higher than my maximum budget of $80 and significantly higher than my fallback option of buying from John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to meet ""halfway"" suggests there's still flexibility in her pricing.  I want to see how low she's willing to go. 
* **Strategic Counter-Offering:** By continuing to negotiate, I increase my chances of securing a price closer to, or even below, my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you working with me.  I could do $70, but that's really pushing my budget."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Nudging Closer:** I'm increasing my offer to $70, which is a significant jump from $60, signaling serious interest to Alice. 
* **Staying Below Max:** It's important to stay below my $80 maximum budget while leaving a small buffer for a potential final counter from Alice. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By saying ""pushing my budget,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency, implying this is my best offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to pay $70, Bob. However, I still need to get the minimum price I'm looking for. I can do $110, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Counter:** Alice's counteroffer of $110 is a step in the wrong direction. It seems she's less willing to negotiate towards my budget.
* **John's Price is Better:**  $80 from John is a guaranteed price within my budget. Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her not going any lower, wasting time, and potentially missing out on John's offer. 
* **Sticking to my Limit:** It's important to stick to my budget and not be pressured into overpaying."
