"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is within your budget, it's not the best deal. You're aiming to save as much as possible, and you know the product is worth $80 to Alice. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Offer a lower price:** Starting with a lower offer ($85) than Alice's initial price ($90) is a common tactic in negotiations.
* **Show willingness to compromise:** The message emphasizes your interest in the product and your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Offering $85 doesn't immediately close the deal, leaving space for further negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the middle:** Alice's offer of $87.50 is a good compromise, considering your initial offer of $85 and her previous offer of $90.
* **Saving money:**  You'll still be saving $2.50 compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing the negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will become less willing to negotiate.
* **Time constraint:** You have a limited number of rounds, and this offer is within your budget."
