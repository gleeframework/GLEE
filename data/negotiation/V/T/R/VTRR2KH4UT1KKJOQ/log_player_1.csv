Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer maximizes my potential profit while keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we start at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me and to Bob. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $800,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $700,000. Would that be agreeable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $700,000 is a good deal considering Bob's persistence and the fact that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
