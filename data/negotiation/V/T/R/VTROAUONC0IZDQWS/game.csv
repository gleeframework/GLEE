"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1100000 for the product. This price is fair given your value for it, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
