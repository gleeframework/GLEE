"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $12,500.  Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more than $12,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  That way, we both get a good deal.  Let me know if that works for you!",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $13,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Bob,4,
