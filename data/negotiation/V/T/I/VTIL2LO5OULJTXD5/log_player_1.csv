{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a starting point that aims for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation. It's important to:

* **Start high:**  $14,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still getting closer to your desired value.
* **Be positive:**  A friendly tone and emphasizing the product's value can create a more positive negotiation environment. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This initial offer allows for counteroffers and bargaining. 
* **Know your backup:** Remember, John is willing to pay $12,000, so you have a solid floor price if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $12,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting his offer allows you to try to push for a higher price. You'll counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more than $12,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  That way, we both get a good deal.  Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** Offering $13,250 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Positive language:**  A friendly tone and highlighting the benefit of a ""good deal"" can help maintain a positive negotiation dynamic.
* **Maintain leverage:** While this offer is closer to Bob's, it still keeps you above your minimum price and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Know your fallback:**  Remember, you can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiations fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $13,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and  very close to your ideal price.  While you could try for a slightly higher price, accepting this offer:

* **Secures a good profit:**  $13,000 is significantly above your minimum of $12,000.
* **Minimizes risk:**  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a lower price.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a good return.
* **Saves time and effort:**  Continuing negotiations could drag on, and it's always beneficial to close a deal when you're happy with the terms."
