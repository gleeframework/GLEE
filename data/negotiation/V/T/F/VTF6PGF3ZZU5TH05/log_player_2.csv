"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's still above Alice's minimum of $800,000, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while also aiming for a significant savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still less than buying from John, it's higher than Bob's previous counteroffer.  Bob should continue to negotiate to try to get a lower price, potentially closer to his original counteroffer of $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering a price that is closer to Alice's latest offer, but still significantly lower than her initial price. This shows that Bob is willing to compromise but is still trying to get a better deal.  This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is serious about closing the deal but will not be pressured into paying a higher price than he deems necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer is only $10,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer. It's highly unlikely Alice will go lower, and rejecting the offer risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product for less than John's price and keeps the negotiation process moving forward."
