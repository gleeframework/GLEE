"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it could be useful, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $6,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you consider $13,000?  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you at that price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
