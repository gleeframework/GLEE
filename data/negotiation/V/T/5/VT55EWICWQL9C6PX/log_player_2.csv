You can likely get a better deal than $1,000,000, so rejecting the offer and counteroffering is the best strategy."

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will give me some room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that's more beneficial for me."

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still higher than my ideal price. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer."

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $800,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating but I'm still aiming for a price that's within my budget."
