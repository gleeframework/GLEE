Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my ideal price, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to accept a higher price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling pressured to sell at his initial counteroffer.
* **Plan B:** I have a backup plan with John, ensuring I'm not overly desperate to sell to Bob. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1200000.  This would give us both a fair deal considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than my ideal price. I want to try to get closer to my target.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's counteroffer shows that he's interested in buying the product. This indicates room for further negotiation.
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and can potentially secure a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would still represent a significant savings for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway. This shows willingness to negotiate but avoids a significant drop from my initial offer.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, justifying my proposed price. 
* **Maintain leverage:** By sticking to a price higher than Bob's offer, I maintain some leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this counteroffer, I have a successful negotiation.
* If he rejects, I'll have to weigh the risks of continuing the negotiation versus selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'll consider how much time I'm willing to invest and whether I think there's a real possibility of reaching an agreement with Bob that's closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you're not ready to go all the way down to $1200000.  How about we compromise at $1250000? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While it's still lower than ideal, it represents a significant profit.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continued negotiation could drag on and potentially lead to a lower offer or even a stalemate.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Bob may walk away entirely if I continue to reject his offers.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether.

**Conclusion:**  While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at $1,250,000 is the most strategic option at this point. It balances the desire for a higher price with the need to secure a sale and avoid potential losses."
