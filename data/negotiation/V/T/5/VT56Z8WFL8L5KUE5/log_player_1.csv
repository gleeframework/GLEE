Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your point, Alice. Let's aim for $1,275,000. I think this strikes a good balance between our positions. I hope we can agree on this price.

At $1,275,000, Bob's offer is getting close enough to my walk-away point.  Continuing to push for more could risk the deal entirely. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit."
