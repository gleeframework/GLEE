"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only commit to a maximum of $1,200,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I consider its true worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  I believe this reflects the product's value while still being a fair deal for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to adjust, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000. This still leaves room for negotiation, and I hope we can find a satisfactory price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we're getting closer.  While $1,250,000 is closer to a fair price, I'm still seeking a bit more.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This represents a significant investment for you, but I'm confident the product's value will far exceed it.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I see your point, Alice. Let's aim for $1,275,000. I think this strikes a good balance between our positions. I hope we can agree on this price.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
