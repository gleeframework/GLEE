Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,000,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind. To move things forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects a significant concession on my end, but I believe it still represents a fair price for the product's value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're making progress.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  This price reflects my desire to strike a deal while recognizing the value of the product.
