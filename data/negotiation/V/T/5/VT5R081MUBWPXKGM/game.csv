"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product has potential, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to go.  Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,000,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind. To move things forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects a significant concession on my end, but I believe it still represents a fair price for the product's value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point we can both agree on. While $1,900,000 is better, it's still a bit high for me. Would you be open to $1,250,000? ",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're making progress.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  This price reflects my desire to strike a deal while recognizing the value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  How about $1,400,000?  I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value you place on the product while working within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
