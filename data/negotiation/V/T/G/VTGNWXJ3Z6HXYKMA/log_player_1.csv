Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value to you, the message hints at it by mentioning ""given its value."" This subtly implies the price is justified. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything as you have John as a backup. If he counter-offers, you know he's serious and can negotiate further. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't settle for less than $12,000.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the door open for a successful negotiation with Bob."
