,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be willing to do $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a little lower than I'd like to go, but I'm willing to meet in the middle.  How about $90?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $90 is closer, but still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $87.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy today.",87.5,Bob,4,
