"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $140? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $150.  This is a fair price, considering it's worth that to me and I'm already prepared to buy it from John for that price.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $150. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $155. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
