Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $12000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.

I'm going to try to get a higher price than $12,000.  I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price."

I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm not willing to settle for $12,500 yet.  I'm going to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about $13,000? I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the market price. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued effort in negotiating, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my research and the market value, I would like to propose a final offer of $12750 for the product. I hope this proposal helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,750 is getting closer to my desired price.  While it's still a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, it's a reasonable offer. Given that I only have 4 rounds left, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  If I reject this offer, I risk losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price."
