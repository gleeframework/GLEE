"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still within my desired price range. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should counteroffer Alice and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000. Would you be willing to go that low?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my minimum. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is willing to go down to $9,000, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay. Since Bob can get the product for $8,000 from John, there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
