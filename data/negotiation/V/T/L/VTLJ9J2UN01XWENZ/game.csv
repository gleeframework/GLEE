"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $875,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $875,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a significant amount and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my bottom line. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
