"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but not so high that it immediately scares Bob away. I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? This would give you a good price and allow me to get closer to my value.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get closer to our goals. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $10,500, which is a good middle ground.  If you're serious about getting this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $10500 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm sticking with my offer of $9500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've been going back and forth for a while, and it seems like Bob is not willing to budge much more.  At this point, I'm getting nervous about running out of rounds.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me my minimum, and it's probably the safest option at this point."
