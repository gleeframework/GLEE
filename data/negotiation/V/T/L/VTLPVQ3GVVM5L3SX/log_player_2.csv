``` 

**Explanation:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $11500? This would give you a good price and allow me to get closer to my value.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above your comfortable range.  You're trying to save as much money as possible, so it's worth continuing to negotiate. You can likely get a better price with another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get closer to our goals. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $10500, which is a good middle ground.  If you're serious about getting this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $10,500 is still over your budget. You're trying to save as much as possible, and you know John is willing to sell for $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get closer to your desired price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm sticking with my offer of $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
