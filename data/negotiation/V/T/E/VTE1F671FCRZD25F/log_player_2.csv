"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've personally valued at no less than $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I believe is fair, considering its worth. Would you be interested in discussing a purchase at $1,000,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is the same as the price John is willing to sell it for. There's no benefit to buying from Alice. Since the goal is to save money, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy."
