Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$130 is a reasonable starting point:** It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential win-win scenario. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:** It emphasizes the value of the product and avoids being overly aggressive, which could make Bob less likely to negotiate. 
* **This offer leaves room for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate further. If he makes a counteroffer, I can evaluate it and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation. 
* **I'm also aware of John's offer:**  This sets a clear floor for my negotiations with Bob. If Bob doesn't meet my expectations, I can confidently switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a considerable loss for me. 
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my target price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John and secure my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with a compromise:**  I'm offering $120, which is a midpoint between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I have a bottom line.
* **Highlighting the value:** I reiterate the value of the product and emphasize that this is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Maintaining a friendly tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging to avoid escalating the negotiation.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $120 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it allows for potential agreement and avoids losing out to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $120. How about we meet at $110? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $110 is closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiations are becoming time-consuming:**  We've already gone through a few rounds, and Bob's offers haven't come close to my desired price. 
* **John's offer provides a guaranteed profit:** I can sell to John immediately for $150, ensuring a profit and avoiding further negotiation with Bob.

I'm confident that John will be a reliable and willing buyer, and I don't want to risk losing out on the guaranteed profit by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
