Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $105. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could try to push for a lower price, $105 is a reasonable compromise. I save money compared to John's offer, and there's a risk Alice will increase her price in later rounds."
