"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as I can.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and it gives us both a great opportunity to make this deal work. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. I'm confident you'll find the product's value justifies this price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
