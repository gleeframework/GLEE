"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 14000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, aiming to secure a good profit. I'm also aware of the risk that Bob might reject this offer, but I believe there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my minimum target of $12,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $12,500. This is still a profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer than my initial offer.  I believe this price is reasonable and might be more appealing to Bob than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is closer to my minimum target, I'm still not ready to settle for less than $12,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a bit further. There are still 6 rounds left, so I have time to see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with my minimum price of $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it meets my minimum target and is within Bob's estimated value. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept this offer, as we're approaching the halfway point of the negotiations."
