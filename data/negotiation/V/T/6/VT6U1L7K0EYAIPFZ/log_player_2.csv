"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can do better.  He can counteroffer and try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $13,500 is a good price, especially considering that he can get the product for $15,000 from John.  There's no guarantee that Bob can get a lower price from Alice, and he risks losing the deal altogether."
