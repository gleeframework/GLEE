Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's value to give myself some negotiating room. I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep the price within $15,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I can't go down to $15,000, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $16,500?  This still allows me to make a profit while giving you a fair price.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate the adjustment in price. I would like to counter with an offer of $16,000. This still keeps the price within my budget while allowing you to maintain a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $16,000 is a good compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal.  It's a better price than John's offer, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
