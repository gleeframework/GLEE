Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers.  Please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have room to start negotiations significantly higher. This leaves space for potential negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing specific details that Bob could use in a counter-offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""Please let me know your thoughts"" signals that you're open to discussing the price further, even if you start high.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's interest and leaving the door open for negotiation."
