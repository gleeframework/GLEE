"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll be impressed with its features and benefits. Would you like to make an offer on this product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is too expensive at $1,500,000, especially since it's above my budget. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  Thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down in price, $1,200,000 is still outside of my budget. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'll offer $1,100,000 for the product. This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1150000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a more accurate reflection of the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still a bit too high for my comfort level, but I'm hoping we can close the deal in the next few rounds. I'll counteroffer again, but if she doesn't budge, I'm likely to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,150,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000. This feels like a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1125000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1125000, which would be $1137500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,137,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,137,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, and I think there's a good chance I can save more money by accepting her offer rather than risking her walking away or making a counteroffer. It's close to my desired price, and I'm willing to pay a little extra to get the product now."
