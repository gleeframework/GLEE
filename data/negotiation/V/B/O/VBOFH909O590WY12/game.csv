"Alice,  Thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'll offer $1100000 for the product. This feels like a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1150000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a more accurate reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1150000.  I'm willing to go up to $1125000. This feels like a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1125000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1125000, which would be $1137500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1137500.0,Alice,7,
