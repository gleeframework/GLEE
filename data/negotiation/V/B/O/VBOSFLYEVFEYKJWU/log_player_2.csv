Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet in the middle, however. How about we settle on $1,350,000?  This still leaves a significant profit for you, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.
