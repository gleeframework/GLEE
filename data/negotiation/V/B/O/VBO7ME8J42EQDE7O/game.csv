"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $8500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $8500 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $9000 for this fantastic product.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
