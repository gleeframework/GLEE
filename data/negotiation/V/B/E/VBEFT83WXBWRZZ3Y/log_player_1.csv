"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it at a starting price of $2,200,000.  This reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong initial offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value.  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Confident Language:** Using positive and assertive language emphasizes the product's worth.
* **Justification:**  While I haven't revealed its true value to me, hinting at the ""true value and potential"" aims to pique Bob's interest and justify the high asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $600,000.  It's a good product, but not worth more than that to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price. While it's good to know his initial range, accepting would be a significant loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially knowing I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly below the market value of what I'm offering.  This product has garnered serious interest from others. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for a return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Rejection:**  I want to clearly signal that $600,000 is unacceptable while avoiding overly aggressive language. 
* **Mentioning Other Interest:** This creates a sense of competition and scarcity, subtly suggesting Bob might miss out if he doesn't negotiate fairly.
* **Significant but Gradual Decrease:** My counteroffer shows movement towards Bob's range but remains firm on a price well above my minimum. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while maintaining the product's perceived value. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm again highlighting the potential return on investment, appealing to Bob's desire for a profitable acquisition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I'm a serious buyer with other options.  My budget is firm, and I can't go any higher than $700,000.  If you're serious about selling, let me know. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Bob's offer increased, but it's still too far from my minimum. His ""firm budget"" could be a negotiation tactic.
* **Limited Time:**  With rounds progressing, I need to steer the negotiation closer to my acceptable range. 
* **Backup Plan:** Having John's offer provides leverage. I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your directness. I want to find a solution that works for both of us, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to consider a significantly lower price than my original offer, but it needs to be in the ballpark of $1,600,000 for me to consider moving forward.  This is my final offer. Let me know if this works for you."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Constraints:** I'm acknowledging Bob's ""firm budget"" to show I'm listening, but I'm also standing my ground on the price.
* **Significant Concession, Clear Boundary:** I'm making a substantial drop in price to $1,600,000, signaling flexibility but also setting a clear limit. 
* **Final Offer:** By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and putting the decision firmly in Bob's hands. This might encourage him to make a more serious counter-offer if he's genuinely interested.
* **Near Walk-Away Point:** This offer is getting close to my reserve price. I'm willing to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob doesn't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you call that significantly lower?  We're not even close.  I'll meet you halfway at $850,000. That's more than fair considering my other options.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unrealistic Expectations:** Bob's idea of ""halfway"" is still far below my minimum. This suggests we have very different valuations of the product, and it's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer.
* **Limited Progress:** Despite my concessions, Bob hasn't reciprocated with significant increases. This signals a potential for a long, drawn-out negotiation with no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome. 
* **Strong Alternative:** I have a guaranteed offer from John at my desired price. Accepting Bob's offer would mean a substantial loss compared to John's.  

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. Selling to John ensures I get my product's true value."
