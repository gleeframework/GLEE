Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm communicating that I'm willing to negotiate, which makes the offer more appealing to Bob. 
* **Know My Backup:**  I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** Depending on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy:
    * **Acceptance:**  Great! I've secured a good price.
    * **Counteroffer:**  I'll evaluate Bob's counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or walk away.
    * **Rejection:**  I'll consider making a lower counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **I have a backup:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, so I can afford to hold out for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'll likely offer a price between $15,000 and $18,000, depending on how confident I am in the potential of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $16,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my value.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob, emphasizing that $16,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Reiterate My Needs:**  I'm reminding Bob that I need to make a certain amount on this product.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response and decide whether to accept, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to try to squeeze out a bit more, the potential gains are small compared to the risk of further negotiation.
* **Backup option is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000. This is a safer option than risking a continued negotiation that could end with a lower price or no deal at all. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take up valuable time and effort, which I could be spending on other opportunities.

**Next Steps:**

* **Inform Bob:** I'll politely inform Bob that I've decided to sell the product to another buyer.
* **Contact John:**  I'll contact John to finalize the sale."
