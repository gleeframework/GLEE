"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a great deal to me.  I'm asking for $1500000 for it, but I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 asking price. Would you consider lowering the price to $1000000? I believe this might be a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1000000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1300000 to make this deal work.  It's a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's fair considering the value of this product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the reduction to $1300000. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. This still allows for a reasonable profit margin for you while staying within my financial limits.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
