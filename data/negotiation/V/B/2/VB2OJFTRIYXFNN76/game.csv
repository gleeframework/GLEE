"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too low for me.  This product is worth a lot, and I'm confident it can bring you value too. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. Could we possibly settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  $9,750 is close, but I'm aiming for at least $10,200. Would that work for you?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000 even? That would be a fair deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
