"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the opportunity to negotiate with you, Alice. However, I believe $1,100,000 is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product extends far beyond its base cost to me.  It holds significant potential for future growth and innovation. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,225,000. This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you believe the product has potential for growth and innovation, but I'm still not convinced that $1,225,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,075,000 for the product. This is a reasonable price that reflects the product's true value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but your offer doesn't reflect the  product's true potential. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose $1,180,000. This recognizes its value while offering you a fair deal.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I still believe $1,180,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,115,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this product.",1115000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,115,000, but I'm still not willing to pay that price. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
