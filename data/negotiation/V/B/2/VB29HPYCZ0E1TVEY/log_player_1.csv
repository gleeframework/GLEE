Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" you're subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth without explicitly revealing your minimum price.
* **Testing the waters:** This first offer helps you gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 

**Important:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, be prepared to negotiate. You can gradually decrease your asking price, but never go below your $800,000 safety net."
