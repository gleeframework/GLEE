Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit for me.  I've chosen a price that is less than the value to Bob, making it more likely he'll accept, but more than what John is willing to pay, making it worthwhile for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant concession, but it still allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$950,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than what John is offering, and it's closer to my desired price point.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
