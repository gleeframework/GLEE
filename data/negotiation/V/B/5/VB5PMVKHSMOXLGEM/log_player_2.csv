"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, he can likely do better. There are 9 rounds remaining, and Bob can always buy from John for $10,000 if negotiations fail.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob more leverage to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, as it's above your minimum, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. It also positions the price slightly above Bob's maximum value, suggesting a willingness to compromise but still seeking a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  It's a fair compromise and still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, he still has leverage. There are 7 rounds remaining, and Bob can always buy from John for $10,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's try $11,000.  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.  I'm confident we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price while remaining within a reasonable range. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to compromise but also signals that he's not willing to overpay. This strategy keeps the pressure on Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,000 is still a little too low for me. Let's aim for a price that's fair for both of us. How about $11,500? It's a good middle ground, and it allows me to keep the value of the product while still offering you a great deal.  Let's close this deal, I believe we're close! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, he still has leverage. There are 5 rounds remaining, and Bob can always buy from John for $10,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further.  It's likely Alice is getting more desperate to close the deal, and Bob can leverage this to get a better price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,250, which is a compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of negotiating slowly and incrementally.  He's raised his offer by a small amount, showing willingness to compromise while still keeping the pressure on Alice. He's also explicitly stating his desire to close the deal, putting the ball in Alice's court. With only 4 rounds left, it's likely Alice will be motivated to accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $11,250, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,400? It's a small increase, but it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this happen in the next few rounds! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer, there are still 3 rounds left, and Bob can still buy from John for $10,000.  Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, but he's not going to rush into a deal that's not in his best interest. Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice and gives Bob more leverage to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,300, which is a small increase but gets us closer to a deal. With only two rounds left, let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11300}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is strategically increasing his offer by a small amount. This shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining leverage.  By emphasizing the limited number of rounds remaining, Bob is trying to create a sense of urgency in Alice. This could potentially push her to accept the offer, as she may not want to risk further negotiation."
