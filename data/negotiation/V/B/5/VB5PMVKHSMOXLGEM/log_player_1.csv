"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a win-win situation for Bob, highlighting the value he'll get. 

**Strategy:**

* I want to see if Bob is willing to pay above his perceived value. 
* If he rejects, I'll adjust my price down slightly in the next round, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, as it's above your minimum, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to take the $10,500, I'm going to hold out and see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counter with a price closer to $12,000, hoping to find a middle ground.
* I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,250.

```

**Strategy:**

* I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's try $11,000.  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.  I'm confident we can find a way to make this work.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $11,250, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,400? It's a small increase, but it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this happen in the next few rounds!"", ""product_price"": 11400}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,300, which is a small increase but gets us closer to a deal. With only two rounds left, let's see if we can make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offer still below my minimum acceptable price, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.  There's no guarantee Bob will agree to my counteroffer, and I risk losing valuable time.

**Strategy:**

It's more advantageous to sell to John at this point. I'm guaranteed to get my minimum price of $15,000, which is significantly better than the potential outcome of continuing the negotiation with Bob.  While I might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars from Bob, the risk of not reaching an agreement is too high."
