Send your offer to Bob.","```json

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We can definitely negotiate further. Bob's valuation is significantly higher than his offer, and we have plenty of rounds left."

""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"",

We're getting closer, but we're still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. We'll continue negotiating."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

It's getting close to the wire, and Bob is unlikely to move much higher. Accepting $880,000 ensures a good profit without risking the deal entirely."
