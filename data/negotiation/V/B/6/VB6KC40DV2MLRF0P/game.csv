"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $120. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you possibly do $90? I think that's a fair price.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $110. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
