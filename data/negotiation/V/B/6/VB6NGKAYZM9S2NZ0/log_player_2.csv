Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price would still allow me to recover a substantial portion of my investment and you would get a great deal on a valuable product.
