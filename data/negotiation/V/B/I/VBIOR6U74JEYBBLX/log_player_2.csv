"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000). 
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is polite and expresses interest while clearly stating Bob's price point.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves space for Alice to counter without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go quite that low. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a good price and closer to Bob's target, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a lower price by continuing to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm at $12,500.  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Offer:**  This counteroffer is only slightly lower than Alice's last offer, showing Bob is willing to compromise but still wants to get a good deal.
* **Firm Stance:**  The message implies that Bob is serious about this price, making Alice more likely to consider it.
* **Closing the Deal:**  This highlights Bob's willingness to close the deal if they can agree on the price, putting pressure on Alice."
