"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above the product's value to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. This establishes a strong initial position and incentivizes Bob to counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefits for Bob. This creates a good starting point for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to maximize my profit by starting high and gradually lowering the price if necessary. 
* The threat of selling to John provides a safety net and leverage in case Bob becomes too stubborn. 
* This round will determine Bob's negotiating stance and how much room for compromise exists."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While it's still above my minimum, I'm not willing to settle so quickly.
* I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 
* Selling to John would be a safe option, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* By showing willingness to negotiate but not settling for a low price, I hope to convince Bob to compromise.
* I'll continue to assess my options, keeping the potential sale to John as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable reduction:** I'm dropping the price slightly from my initial offer, showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Reiterate the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, emphasizing that my price is still fair.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and cooperative tone, encouraging further discussion.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* It demonstrates a willingness to compromise without sacrificing too much profit.
* By showing flexibility while maintaining a clear stance on the value, I aim to push Bob closer to my desired price.
* I'll continue to observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is the price John is offering.  Let's close this deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob has offered my minimum price, which is what John is also offering. This means I'm guaranteed to receive $1,500,000 regardless of who I sell to. 
* There's no benefit to continuing negotiation, as I'm unlikely to get a higher offer from Bob.
* Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure the sale and move on without wasting time on further rounds.

**Strategy:**

* While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting the offer is the most logical choice in this situation.
* This ensures I achieve my minimum goal while avoiding the risk of Bob rejecting further offers or the possibility of losing time with more negotiations.
* This concludes the negotiation successfully."
