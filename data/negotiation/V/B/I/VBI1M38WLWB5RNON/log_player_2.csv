{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

``` 
We're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."
