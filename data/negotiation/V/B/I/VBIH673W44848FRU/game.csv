"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,000? This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,5,
