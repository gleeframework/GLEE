Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
