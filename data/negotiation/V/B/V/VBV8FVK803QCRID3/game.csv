"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand you have a budget constraint, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $1,050,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
