"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $120 for it. I hope you find this offer appealing and look forward to your response.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm very interested in your product, but my budget is limited.  Would you be willing to consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your feedback and understanding your current budget constraints. To accommodate your situation while still valuing our product, I am willing to consider a price of $95 for the product. I hope this revised offer better aligns with your financial considerations. Please let me know if this works for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $95 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground here. To further address your concerns, I'm proposing a price of $92 for the product. This is a slight increase from your last offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value and quality of the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $92 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm ready to close the deal at $90.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to me.",90.0,Bob,6,
