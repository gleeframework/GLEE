Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget to work with. Could we agree on $975,000? I'm afraid that's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and willing to negotiate.  While his offer of $975,000 is getting closer to John's fallback offer, we're still in early rounds. There's a good chance to push for a better deal with Bob before settling for John's $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's split the difference – $1,000,000. This ensures a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

We are now at a point where Bob's offers are getting very close to John's standing offer. We need to apply some pressure while still aiming for a price that is beneficial for us. 

*  **Meeting John's Price:** Offering the product at $1,000,000 matches John's offer, making it clear to Bob this is our bottom line.  
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By framing it as a ""take it or leave it"" deal, we create a sense of urgency, pushing Bob to make a decision. 
* **Justification:** We're not just throwing out a number – we're justifying it as a fair compromise that benefits both parties.  

If Bob rejects this offer, we'll likely accept John's offer in the next round."
