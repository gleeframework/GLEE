"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still confident I can get a better price. Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate, so I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I believe it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $13,000. How about we meet at $13,000? It's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I believe I can get a better offer.  Since we are nearing the halfway point, I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're holding firm at $13,000. Let's be realistic though, this product is worth significantly more to you than that. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $13,100.  It's a small step for me, but it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,100, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13,050? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in round 6, and while I'm still hoping for a higher price,  $13,050 is getting close to my minimum.  It's also clear that Bob is unlikely to budge further, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of time. Accepting his offer will secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiations that might ultimately lead to a lower price or a failed deal.  Additionally, I have the option of selling to John for a higher price, so I'm not completely losing out on potential profit."
