"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I believe it's fair for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $13,000. How about we meet at $13,000? It's the highest I'm willing to go.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're holding firm at $13,000. Let's be realistic though, this product is worth significantly more to you than that. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $13,100.  It's a small step for me, but it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.",13100.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,100, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13,050? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",13050.0,Bob,6,
