{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than your minimum acceptable price. This creates room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for that price. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. I will counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
