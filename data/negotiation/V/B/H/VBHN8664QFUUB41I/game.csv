"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for that price. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Alice,3,
