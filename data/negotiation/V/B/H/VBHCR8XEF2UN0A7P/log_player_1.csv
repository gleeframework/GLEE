Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I've done extensive research and believe its true value is well above the standard market price. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and that John acts as a safety net.  Starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""true value"" and ""unique"" nature, Alice aims to anchor Bob's perception of the price at a higher level.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. Alice can then gradually lower the price, still aiming for a figure significantly above her minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  This strategy assumes Bob is potentially open to paying a premium for something he perceives as valuable. If Alice knows Bob to be a very tough negotiator, she might adjust her approach.
* **Market Information:**  This strategy assumes some degree of exclusivity for the product. If similar products are readily available at lower prices, Bob is less likely to accept a high price."
