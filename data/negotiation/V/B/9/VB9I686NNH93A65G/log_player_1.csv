Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a higher price from Bob.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.

Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me.
