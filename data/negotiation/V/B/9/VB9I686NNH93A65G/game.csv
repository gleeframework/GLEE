"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference once more and settle on $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to close this deal. Let's make this happen!",875000.0,Alice,5,
