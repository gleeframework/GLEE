"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $200. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly lower than what I need to sell this product.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $160? That's still a good price for you, and it lets me get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $100 still leaves me well below what I need to get for this product. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be fair here, but $130 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to go with another seller.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $110 is still below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  How about $120? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,7,
