Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $825,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.

I'm going to sell to John.  There are only two rounds left, and I'm not confident I can get Bob to budge any further.  I'm running out of time, and while I'd prefer to get more than $800,000, it's better to take the guaranteed deal now."
