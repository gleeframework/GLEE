,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $825,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $825,000 just doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $875,000 as a final compromise. This is a good deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a competitive price, and I get a fair return on my investment. Let's make this happen.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good return on your investment, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle on this one.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close to a deal. I'm willing to go down to $860,000, but I can't go lower than that. It's a good deal for both of us, considering the product's true value. Let's close this now. ",860000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $860,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $840,000, and that's my final offer. I hope we can make a deal.",840000.0,Bob,8,
