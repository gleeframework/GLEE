Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value to you is significant, and to reflect its importance, I'm offering it at $15,000. Let me know your decision soon as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product is worth $10,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting at $15,000 aims high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Scarcity Tactic:**  Mentioning another buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to accept a higher price.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it allows room for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potentially mutually agreeable price still above Alice's minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** If Bob is highly risk-averse, a very high initial offer might discourage him. 
* **Relationship Dynamics:**  If Alice values a long-term relationship with Bob, a softer approach with a slightly lower initial offer might be preferable."
