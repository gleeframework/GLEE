"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. It's still a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!",14000.0,Alice,3,

It's still a good price considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,5,
