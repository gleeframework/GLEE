"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's significantly more than your maximum budget and even acknowledges your valuation. Rejecting this offer gives you a chance to negotiate a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's a good starting point to gauge her flexibility. 
* **Leaving Room:**  This leaves a lot of room for negotiation before hitting your $12,000 maximum. 
* **Alternative:**  Don't forget you have John's offer of $12,000 as a backup plan."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. It's still a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to your range, $14,000 is still above your ideal price and what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. How about $11,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm eager to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer splits the difference between your last offer ($10,000) and her current one ($14,000). 
* **Staying Below Budget:** It keeps you below your $12,000 maximum and leaves some slight wiggle room.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding ""I'm eager to make this deal happen"" can subtly encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're eager to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. It's still a good price considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $13,000.  She knows your valuation and is playing hardball. You've negotiated well, but it's time to cut your losses. John's offer of $12,000 saves you money and avoids further haggling."
