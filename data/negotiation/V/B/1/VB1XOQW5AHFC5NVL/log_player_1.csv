I'm offering Bob the product for $15,000. This gives me a good profit margin while still being a potentially attractive price for Bob, especially if he values the product higher than $10,000.  If he rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $10,000, so I have nothing to lose by trying to get a better price."
