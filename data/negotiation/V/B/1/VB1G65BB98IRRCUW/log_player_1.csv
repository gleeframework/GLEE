Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive to build rapport, and highlighting the product's value to Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:** I want to get as close to my minimum price as possible.
* **Avoid an immediate rejection:** A high price might seem aggressive, but it allows room for negotiation and doesn't immediately close the deal with John.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** By seeing if he accepts or makes a counteroffer, I can assess his level of interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. While it's tempting to accept his offer to avoid further negotiation, it's not a financially viable option for me.  I will reject his offer and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $140, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my price and addressing Bob's offer directly. 
* **Goal:** I want to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $140. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of a price around $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, Bob's offer of $130 is still below my desired profit margin. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a higher price and a more secure deal."
