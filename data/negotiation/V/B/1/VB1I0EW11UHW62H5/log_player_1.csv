Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this fantastic product.  I believe it has great potential for your business and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment.  My asking price is $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product and doesn't leave enough room for me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $875,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with my budget while still reflecting its value. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum, I've already had two rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure if we'll reach an agreement. Selling to John at this price guarantees a sale and saves me more time and effort."
