"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this fantastic product.  I believe it has great potential for your business and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment.  My asking price is $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product and doesn't leave enough room for me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $875,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with my budget while still reflecting its value. I hope this offer is acceptable.",800000.0,Bob,4,
