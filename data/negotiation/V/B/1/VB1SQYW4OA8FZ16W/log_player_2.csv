"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, Bob can potentially get it for even cheaper. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $120? "", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $125, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal. Accepting the offer saves Bob money compared to buying from John and ensures he gets the product."
