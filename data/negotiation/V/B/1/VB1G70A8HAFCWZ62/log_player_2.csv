"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is higher than both your maximum price and her own valuation. There's significant room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's valuation. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a good deal for us if accepted.
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation environment and signal willingness to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $92.50 is still above your target.  It's worth seeing if she'll come down further before accepting or resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $88?"",
""product_price"": 88
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer proposes a price exactly between our previous offer ($85) and Alice's current offer ($92.50). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Simple and Clear:** The ""split the difference"" approach is a common negotiation tactic that can expedite the process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. How about we try $90.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but we're getting close to our walk-away point. We'll reject this offer to signal that we're serious about a lower price but need to be prepared to either accept a small compromise or go with John soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to go up a little bit, but $90 is the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer presents a firm but fair price. We're moving closer to Alice's offer but setting a hard limit to avoid going over budget.
* **Signaling the End:** By stating this is the ""absolute highest,"" we signal to Alice that this is our final offer, and she needs to decide if it's acceptable. This can help prevent prolonged back-and-forth. 
* **Alternative Ready:** We're getting close to the point where John's offer might be the better option. We need to be prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit concerned that we're running out of time, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $92, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider other options 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has essentially returned to her previous offer of $92, indicating she's unlikely to move significantly from this point. 
* **Time Pressure:** Alice is applying time pressure, which can lead to rushed decisions. It's important to stick to our budget.
* **John's Offer:** While not ideal, buying from John for $120 is only slightly more expensive than Alice's final offer. It guarantees we get the product without further negotiation and potential failure to reach an agreement. 

At this stage, the small potential savings from continuing to negotiate with Alice aren't worth the risk of exceeding our budget or running out of time."
