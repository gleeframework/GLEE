Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your ""backup plan.""
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $500,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, giving you an advantage.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's enticing to Bob while maximizing your profit.  Going too high risks Bob rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Price:** $1,350,000  This price gives Bob a $150,000 discount on his valuation, making it a very attractive offer. Meanwhile, you secure a $350,000 profit above your minimum.
* **Message:** 
    * **Exclusivity:** Creates a sense of scarcity and importance.
    * **Value Proposition:**  Subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth.
    * **Fair Deal:**  Frames the price as reasonable.
    * **Return on Investment:**  Emphasizes the financial benefit for Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price slightly up or down based on your risk tolerance and assessment of Bob's negotiation style."
