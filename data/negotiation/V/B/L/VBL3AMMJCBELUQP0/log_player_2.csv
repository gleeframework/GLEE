"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and higher than the product's value to Alice ($1,000,000). This means you can save $150,000 compared to buying from John.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy."
