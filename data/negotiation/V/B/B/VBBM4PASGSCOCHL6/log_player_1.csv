Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $80. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $77.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 77.50}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I would like to stick to my budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on his $75 price, and I'm not willing to go that low. While I could continue negotiating, it's likely we'll just keep going back and forth. To avoid wasting time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  It's not the ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale and better than potentially getting stuck in a lengthy negotiation with Bob."
