Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit margin of $400,000 ($1,200,000 - $800,000).

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's below his $800,000 valuation) while maximizing your own profit. However, going too low might make him suspicious or undervalue the product.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at a special price before considering other offers. I believe this is a win-win opportunity for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 795000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency, suggesting Bob is getting a preferential deal.
* **Product Price:** $795,000 is slightly below Bob's valuation. This price point:
    *  Makes it highly likely Bob will accept, as it offers him significant savings.
    *  Still nets you a considerable profit of $55,000 more than your guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is valuable, you might consider a slightly lower price to foster goodwill.
* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start higher (but still below $800,000) to leave room for negotiation.
