"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is the maximum I can pay. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I hope you'll agree to it. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
