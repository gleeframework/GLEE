Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a significant profit margin above Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer even if it's slightly above his perceived value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate. Be prepared to slightly lower the price if needed, but hold firm on a number that ensures a substantial profit.
* **Alternative Buyers:**  While John is a backup, exploring other potential buyers could potentially drive the price even higher."
