"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for $950,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $950,000 is still significantly higher than Alice's valuation of $800,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Buying from John is a fallback:**  While $1,000,000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, it's important to exhaust all negotiation options with Alice first. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal your intent to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $920,000. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she's lowered her price, $920,000 is still closer to her valuation than yours.  
* **There's still room for compromise:** You can likely push for a lower price, especially since Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.
* **Buying from John is still the fallback:** While $1,000,000 is a lot, it's worth exploring if you can get a better price from Alice. 

**Next Step:**  A counteroffer to Alice at a price closer to your valuation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. I think it's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your range:** $900,000 is closer to your maximum price of $1,000,000 than her previous offers.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While you might be able to squeeze a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might reject your next counteroffer, leaving you with the option of buying from John at a higher price.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation may take additional time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer at $900,000 is a good compromise that saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
