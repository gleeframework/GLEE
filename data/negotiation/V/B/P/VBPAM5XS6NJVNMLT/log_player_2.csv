"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! I think it's a fantastic fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering the value you'll get from it, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
Alice's offer is $200,000 less than your maximum budget and $200,000 more than her value. This sounds like a fair deal, and it's better than buying from John for $1,500,000."
