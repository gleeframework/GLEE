"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're proposing a price of $100 for it. We understand its worth to you might be higher, but we hope this offer aligns with your budget while still allowing us to fairly compensate for our efforts and resources. Looking forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $100.
* **You can save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $20 compared to buying from John.

While you could potentially try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll accept. Accepting her current offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product within your budget and save money."
