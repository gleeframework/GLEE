"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to $900000 to make this work.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $875000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825000 is still below my minimum price point. I'm not comfortable going any lower.  Let's try $850000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product for you.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation.",850000.0,Alice,5,
