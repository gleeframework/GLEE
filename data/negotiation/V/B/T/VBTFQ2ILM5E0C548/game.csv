"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair, considering the value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it still leaves room for us both to be happy.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
