This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, as I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  I'll gauge Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can do better. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,400,000.  This shows flexibility while still maintaining a profitable margin. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, it's a significant improvement over John's offer.  I'm going to accept and move forward with the sale."
