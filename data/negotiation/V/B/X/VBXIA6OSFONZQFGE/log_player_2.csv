# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer of $900,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a win-win for both of us, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist. What do you think?
