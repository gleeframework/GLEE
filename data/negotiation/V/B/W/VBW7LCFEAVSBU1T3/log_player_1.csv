Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob,  hinting at its overall value can make a higher price more palatable.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum price.  

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Gauge his interest and adjust your price accordingly, but never go below your $15,000 minimum."
