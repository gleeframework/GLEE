"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done some research and understand its worth to you is $1200000. As the seller, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. After careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $900000. This is a significant discount from its true value, but I believe it's a fair price considering the market conditions. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $900,000 is less than your maximum of $1,200,000.
* **You save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John.

Even though you could get the product for $800,000 from Alice in theory, it's in your best interest to secure the deal at $900,000, as this still represents a significant saving and ensures you get the product."
