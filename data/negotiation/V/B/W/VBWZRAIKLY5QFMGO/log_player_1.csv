Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects its true worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $10,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, while still staying comfortably above your minimum acceptable price ($8,000).
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 
 
This strategy prioritizes securing the higher profit from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
