"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price, but it still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking to receive. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, Bob's offer of $9,500 is still a good deal.  It's significantly higher than selling to John, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting his offer is the best option at this point."
