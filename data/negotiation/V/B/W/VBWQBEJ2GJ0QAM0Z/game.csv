"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I think your initial price is a little high. I'm willing to offer $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. This product has the potential to generate considerable returns for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a very competitive offer considering its potential worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I understand your budget concerns and want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000 for the product.  This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,000,000.  I think this is a very fair price and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. If you can't accept this, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
