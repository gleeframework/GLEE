"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I propose a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to your maximum budget than her own valuation. You should counter-offer with a significantly lower price to start negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I think your initial price is a little high. I'm willing to offer $850,000."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. This product has the potential to generate considerable returns for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a very competitive offer considering its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but slowly.  She's still significantly closer to your budget than her valuation. Continue negotiating and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to make sure it works within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?"",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I understand your budget concerns and want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000 for the product.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's risky, but Alice saying ""$1,050,000 is my final offer"" might just be a tactic to pressure you. You're willing to walk away and buy from John for $1,200,000, so it's worth one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,000,000.  I think this is a very fair price and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. If you can't accept this, I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1000000
