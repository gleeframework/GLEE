This is my final round with Bob, and unfortunately, we haven't been able to agree on a price that works for both of us. Although I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I don't want to risk losing out completely.  

I've decided to sell to John for $1,000,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant amount of money and ensures I don't have to continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting nothing."
