I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping that Bob will be interested in the product and that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current proposal. I believe this price is fair, and I hope Bob will see it as a reasonable middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still a significant profit. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
