"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for my budget, though. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value for the product. This gives me some room to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly below her initial offer and my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $105 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference - how about $122.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above my target. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

I'm proposing a price closer to the middle of our previous offers. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
