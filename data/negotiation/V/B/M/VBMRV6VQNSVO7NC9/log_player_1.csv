"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for my budget, though. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $105 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference - how about $122.50?"", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $115 is a good compromise and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
