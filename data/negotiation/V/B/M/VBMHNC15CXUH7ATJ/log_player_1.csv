Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $2,000,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:** Phrasing like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""one-time offer"" can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Justification for Price:**  While not explicitly stating its worth to Bob, the message implies the product's high value, making the asking price seem more reasonable.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Negotiation is complex. You could:
* **Start lower:**  Perhaps $1,750,000, leaving room to negotiate but still exceeding John's offer. 
* **Highlight product benefits:** Tailor your message to emphasize why Bob would find the product valuable, potentially justifying a higher price."
