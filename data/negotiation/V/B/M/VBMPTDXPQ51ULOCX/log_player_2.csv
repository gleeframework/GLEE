"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than Bob's maximum budget of $150, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80). There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in buying for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction, making a counteroffer of $100. This price is still above Alice's value of $80, leaving room for further negotiation while still saving Bob a considerable amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still above her value of $80 but a decent compromise. Bob has a limited number of rounds and doesn't want to risk losing the opportunity.  Accepting the offer at $110 saves Bob $40 compared to buying from John."
