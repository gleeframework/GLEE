"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. It holds immense value for us, but considering its significance to you, we believe it's worth more than just its monetary value. Given its worth to you, we propose to sell it to you for $10,000. This offer allows us to recoup a substantial portion of its value while ensuring you get it at a fair price. We hope this aligns with your expectations and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000, you know you have a backup option with John. By rejecting this offer, you can see if Alice is willing to lower her price further, potentially saving you even more money."
