"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer is still above your desired price point.
* Rejecting allows you to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal. 
* You have the option to go to John if the negotiation with Alice fails, so there's no immediate risk in rejecting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price that's still higher than Alice's minimum value of $800,000. 
* This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product but also trying to negotiate a better price.
* It's a good starting point for further negotiation, giving Alice room to counter if she wishes."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now $900,000, which is closer to my desired price point. 
* It's still significantly lower than buying from John for $1,000,000.
* While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of further negotiation failing and having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential benefit of saving another $50,000. 
* Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price without risking a higher cost."
