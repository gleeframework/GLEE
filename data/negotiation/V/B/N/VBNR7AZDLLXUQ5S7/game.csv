"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $8,000. I believe you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it and the fact that I could get it elsewhere for $8,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and my other options. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,800. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, while also being a good deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9800.0,Alice,5,
