Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a valuable asset that's worth at least $1,200,000 to me. I'm confident it holds significant potential for you as well.  My initial offer is $1,500,000.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure it's worth $1500000 to me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which I think is a fair price considering the potential value you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible and come down a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This still provides a significant margin for you, and it's a fair price given the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I still think $1350000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to offer $1100000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I think the product holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'll try to counter again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure the price is fair.  I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a good compromise that reflects the potential value of the product. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to offer $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I think the product holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's not worth risking a further decrease in price.  I'll sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
