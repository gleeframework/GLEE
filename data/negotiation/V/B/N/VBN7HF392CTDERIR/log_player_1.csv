Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a bolder approach with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or other factors that might influence his decision."
