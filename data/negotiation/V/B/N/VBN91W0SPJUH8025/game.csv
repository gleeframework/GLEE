"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $1200000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $850000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $900000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
