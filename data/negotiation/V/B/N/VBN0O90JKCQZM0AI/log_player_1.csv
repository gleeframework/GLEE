Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's still a good price for me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than $80, I can still make more money. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $95 is my final offer.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $90 is a good compromise and it's still above my minimum price of $120.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $120."
