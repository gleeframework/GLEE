"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While your offer is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $11,000. How about $10,900?  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10900.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,750 is still just a little too low for me. I'm going to have to stick to my minimum price of $11,000.  If you're serious about buying the product, I'm willing to accept $11,000 as a final offer.  Let me know your decision.",11000.0,Alice,7,
