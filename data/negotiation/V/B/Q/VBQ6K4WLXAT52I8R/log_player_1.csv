Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point above my minimum value, but it's not so high that it would immediately scare Bob away. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and potentially start a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum value, I'm not comfortable selling for that price right now. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000.  This is still above my minimum, and I'm hoping to meet Bob halfway. I believe there's a good chance he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident that I can get a better price from him.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so I'll choose to sell to him."
