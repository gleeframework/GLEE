"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below my ideal price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us to both achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
