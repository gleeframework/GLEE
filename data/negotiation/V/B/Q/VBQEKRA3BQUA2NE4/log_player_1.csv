Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its potential value and my current financial capacity.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
