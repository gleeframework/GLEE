"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the potential in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your offer, the product's worth to me is significantly higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
