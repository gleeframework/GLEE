"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to your business. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price lower than its market value. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
