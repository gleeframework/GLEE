"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Could we settle on something closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000?  This would give you a great deal, and still leave me with a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,3,
