{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price above Bob's valuation but not too far off, leaving room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my original asking price.  I'll counter his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $160 is still a bit too low for me. How about $165? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 165}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $165 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $155? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $155 is just above my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to accept it and close the deal with him."
