Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffers. If Bob rejects, I'll have to decide whether to lower my price further or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. While it's tempting to take the $9,000, I'm confident I can do better.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  If not, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I think is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work! "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer is still above my minimum price, but it shows flexibility and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.  By offering $11,000, I'm leaving room for further negotiation if necessary, but also ensuring I don't lose out on too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $11,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough for me to feel comfortable with the deal. I've already made two counteroffers and Bob's not budging much.  It's clear we're not going to reach an agreement.  Instead of continuing to negotiate and potentially wasting more time, I'm going to go with the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
