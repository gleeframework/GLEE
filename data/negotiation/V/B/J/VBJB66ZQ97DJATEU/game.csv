"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I think is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work! ",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $11,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
