**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to go above $1,000,000. We've been negotiating in good faith and decreasing the price steadily, but he's holding firm. At this point, the potential gains from continuing the negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. It's time to cut our losses and take the sure deal."
