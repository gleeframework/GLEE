"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your perspective, $900,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the value it brings while leaving some room for us to find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is really pushing the lower limits of what I can accept.  I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,025,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's worth. I'm hopeful you'll see the value in this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but we need to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000. However, I need you to understand that this is my absolute limit.  Let's close this deal.",1010000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,010,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",985000.0,Bob,8,
