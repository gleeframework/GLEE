"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $100 right now.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a bit of a budget, Bob, but $200 is already a very fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $170 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $120, which is a significant increase from my original offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come down to $150, but that's my absolute lowest.  This is a fantastic deal on a product you'll love.",150.0,Alice,5,
