Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm setting the price at $11,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it slightly below that ($11,500) maximizes her potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($500).
* **Time Value & Certainty:** Selling to John guarantees $10,000, but Bob's potential offer is more appealing. By offering a price Bob is likely to accept, Alice avoids the risk of going back to John and secures a faster, more profitable sale. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  The message leaves some subtle room for negotiation. If Bob counters, Alice can still potentially go slightly lower while remaining above her minimum. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice doesn't know John is willing to pay $10,000. If she did, she might negotiate differently with Bob."
