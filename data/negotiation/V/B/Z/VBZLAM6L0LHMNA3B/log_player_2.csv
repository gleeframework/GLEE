"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first.  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider my own costs and value the product at a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is my best price for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still a bit high. Bob should try to negotiate further and see if he can get Alice to come down closer to his offer of $950,000. There are still rounds left, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and your minimum price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway in the last round, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. I'll make one more concession: I'll throw in some additional support and maintenance services worth $50,000, which will bring the total value of the deal to $1,100,000. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000, and include the $50,000 in services for free. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **The price is good:**  $1,050,000 is significantly lower than John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Added value:**  The additional support and maintenance services worth $50,000 are a bonus. This increases the overall value of the deal, making it more attractive.
* **Limited rounds:**  There are only a few rounds left, and rejecting this offer could lead to a higher price or running out of time.

While Bob might prefer a lower price, accepting this offer ensures a good deal while saving a substantial amount compared to John."
