Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and your minimum price.

However, I've already met you halfway in the last round, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. I'll make one more concession: I'll throw in some additional support and maintenance services worth $50,000, which will bring the total value of the deal to $1,100,000. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000, and include the $50,000 in services for free. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
