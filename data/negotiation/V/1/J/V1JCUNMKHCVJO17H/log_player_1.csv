Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You know Bob values the product at $120. Offering it at $115 gives him a small incentive to buy from you ($5 profit) while maximizing your potential earnings. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, it leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a slightly lower price.
* **Above Your Minimum:**  The offer is still significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($100 from John), ensuring you make a good profit regardless."
