"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the immense benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming high in the initial rounds to establish a strong position and leave room for negotiation.  
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""immense benefits"" to justify the high price.
* **Understanding Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, but our minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000. We need to bridge that gap strategically.

This first offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $2,250,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate and several rounds left. We'll try to bring him closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It demonstrates your seriousness about the product. While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product, in terms of its potential ROI and unique advantages, sits at a higher point. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the exceptional nature of what's on offer."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a $250,000 concession to show Bob we're willing to negotiate. However, we are still above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value Emphasis:** We're continuing to emphasize the product's value and potential ROI to justify the price point.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** We're aiming to find a middle ground where both parties feel like they're getting a reasonable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that balances the value of the product with my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is significantly above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating strong interest. Meeting him halfway at this price point is a good outcome.
* **Time Value:** While we have rounds remaining, securing a deal now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
