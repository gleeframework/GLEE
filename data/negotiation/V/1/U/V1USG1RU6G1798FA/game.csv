"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm hoping we can find a price somewhere in the middle. How about $11,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and would like to continue negotiating. I would like to propose a price of $10,500. This would allow me to stay within my budget while still acquiring a valuable item.",10500.0,Bob,4,
