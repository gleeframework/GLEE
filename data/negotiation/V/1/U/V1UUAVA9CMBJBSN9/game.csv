"Alice, thanks for the offer but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be happy to consider a price of $8,500. This is my best offer and reflects the value I see in the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise, considering my budget. Let me know if you're open to that.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $9,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $10,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,5,
