"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $9,500.  I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum value ($10,000).**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible.
* **Rejecting gives you leverage.**  By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price. 
* **John's offer is a backup.**  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $8,500 is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her value. 
* **Show interest:**  Expressing interest in the product helps keep negotiations positive.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** There's still a gap between your offer and Alice's value, allowing for further back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,500 represents a fair price considering its value, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your budget:** $9,000 is less than your maximum value of $10,000.
* **It's likely the best deal you'll get:**  Alice has indicated this is her ""final offer,"" meaning further negotiation might be unproductive.
* **You're saving money:** You're getting the product for $1,000 less than John's price."
