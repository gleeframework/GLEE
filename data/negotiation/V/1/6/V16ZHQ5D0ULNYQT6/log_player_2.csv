"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can do better than $100. You should try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  How about $90?  That's still a fair price for you, and it leaves room for us both to be happy."", ""product_price"": 90}
