{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving you room to negotiate down. I've chosen $2,000,000 because it's significantly above your minimum of $1,500,000, but still leaves some potential for a fair deal if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, and you have a guaranteed buyer in John for $1,500,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if you can reach a better price, but selling to John right now would be a safer option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is far below what this product is worth.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Bob that you're willing to negotiate but still holding firm on a price that's closer to your minimum. It leaves room for further negotiations if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While he seems serious about walking away, you have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum.  It's not worth risking a sale for a lower price, especially when you have a solid backup option."
