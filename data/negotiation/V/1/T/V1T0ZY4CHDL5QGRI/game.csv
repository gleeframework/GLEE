"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800000 is far below what this product is worth.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1400000.  This gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
