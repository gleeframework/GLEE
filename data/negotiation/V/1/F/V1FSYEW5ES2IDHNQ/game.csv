"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,100,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,050,000. Would that be workable for you?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $1,080,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm willing to go a little higher to avoid dragging this out.  How about $1,065,000?",1065000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,065,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,090,000. I think this is the best we can do, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value.",1090000.0,Alice,7,
