"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's something I value at least $120, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a bit less. How does $135 sound?  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Buying from Alice at $135 saves you $15 compared to buying from John at $150.
* **You still get a good deal:**  Alice's offer is still below your maximum value of $150."
