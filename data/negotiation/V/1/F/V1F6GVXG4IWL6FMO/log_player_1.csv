Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible, since that's what John will pay. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting high leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down. 
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price makes it seem like Bob is getting a good deal, even though it's still significantly higher than his perceived value."
