Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,200,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer that's closer to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  A price of $1,200,000 allows both you and Bob to benefit significantly from the deal. You secure a $400,000 profit above your minimum, and Bob saves $300,000 compared to his perceived value.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 gives you leverage. It allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have a good understanding of Bob's needs and the value proposition of the product for him."
