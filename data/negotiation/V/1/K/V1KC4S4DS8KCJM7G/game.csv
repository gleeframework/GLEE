"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer you the product for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $14,000 is still a little too high for my budget. Could you do $11,000? I think that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $14,000 and $11,000, so I'll offer you the product for $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you've been really accommodating and I appreciate that. How about we settle at $11,750?  It's a fair offer and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",11750.0,Bob,6,
