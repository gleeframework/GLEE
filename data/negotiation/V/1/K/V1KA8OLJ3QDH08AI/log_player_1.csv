"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with my own offer. I think I can still get a higher price than $8,500, especially since I know the product is worth more to him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $10,000, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer, I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll counter with a price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not comfortable going any lower than $8,900.  This price is fair to both of us, given the value you place on the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
