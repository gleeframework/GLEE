"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $15,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob offered the absolute minimum he's willing to pay, and it's significantly less than my minimum and what John offers. There's room for negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $15,000 might have been a bit high, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I can consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is my final offer before I explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is a tricky spot. Bob is signaling this is his final offer, and it's still below John's offer. However, there's a chance I could lose both deals if I push further.
