,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a deal, Bob! However, $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $92.50?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go a little higher, but $92.50 is still a bit too much for me. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually agreeable price. I can do $95, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be interested in?",95.0,Alice,5,
