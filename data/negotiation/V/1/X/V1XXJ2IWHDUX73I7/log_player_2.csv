# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what you are willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $700,000 is closer to what you're willing to pay, it's still above your target.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can bring the price down even more before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $650,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product and represents the absolute maximum I can afford at this time. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $675,000 is getting close to your maximum budget of $650,000. It's worth considering accepting this offer as further negotiation might not yield a significantly lower price, and you risk losing the deal entirely or being forced to buy from John at a much higher price."
