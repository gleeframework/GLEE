"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product with you. However, $800,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it, considering its potential value to me. I'm confident this price is fair and reflects the potential of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $650,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product and represents the absolute maximum I can afford at this time. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,5,
