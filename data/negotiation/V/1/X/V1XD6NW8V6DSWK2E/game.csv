"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is quite a bit higher than I was thinking. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. Considering the value this product offers, I can come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair offer, reflecting the significant benefits you'll gain.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $2,000,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. To be honest, I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be reasonable. What do you say we meet in the middle somewhere?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being straightforward about your budget.  I want to find a solution that works for both of us, but to be transparent, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the step down, and I do want to find a way to make this work. However, to be frank, $1,750,000 is still a significant stretch for me. How about we try $1,250,000? That feels like a more reasonable compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It seems we both see the value in this product, and I believe we're close to a deal that benefits us both. To bridge the gap, I can accept $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're close. And I respect that you've made concessions to get us here.  However, to make this work on my end, I need to be at $1,300,000. That's the absolute best I can do.  I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
