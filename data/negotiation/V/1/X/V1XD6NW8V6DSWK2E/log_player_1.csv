"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm offering it at $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique potential"" and ""true worth"" of the product to justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The tone remains positive and open to discussion, signaling my willingness to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is quite a bit higher than I was thinking. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum price and his own perceived value. While his counter-offer was expected, accepting $800,000 would be a substantial loss.  It's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. Considering the value this product offers, I can come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair offer, reflecting the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:** I've lowered my price by $250,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The new price is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's value to justify the price and keep the focus on its benefits.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** The tone remains collaborative, aiming to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $2,000,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. To be honest, I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be reasonable. What do you say we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at his perceived value, but that's still substantially below my minimum. While he's suggesting a ""middle ground,"" I need to see him move significantly from his $1,000,000 offer before considering a compromise in that range.  Negotiations continue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being straightforward about your budget.  I want to find a solution that works for both of us, but to be transparent, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** I'm acknowledging Bob's position and budget limitations while being clear that his offer is too low.
* **Significant Drop:**  I've made a substantial drop from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000 to signal a willingness to compromise, but only if Bob is willing to move significantly from his position as well. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating my desire to close the deal and highlighting the price reduction as a sign of commitment.
* **Pressure:**  By emphasizing this is a substantial reduction, I'm subtly putting some pressure on Bob to respond with a more significant counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the step down, and I do want to find a way to make this work. However, to be frank, $1,750,000 is still a significant stretch for me. How about we try $1,250,000? That feels like a more reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer, which shows he's willing to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still below my $1,500,000 minimum.  I need to hold firm and encourage him to move closer to my range.  We're getting into the later rounds, so I'll need to consider my walk-away point carefully if he doesn't budge significantly in the next round or two."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It seems we both see the value in this product, and I believe we're close to a deal that benefits us both. To bridge the gap, I can accept $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm stating that this is my final offer to signal the end of the negotiation is near. This adds a level of urgency for Bob to respond.
* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm not moving as much in this round ($150,000 drop) and emphasizing that this is a fair price that reflects the product's value.
* **Compromise Highlighted:** By framing it as bridging the gap and a deal that benefits both of us, I'm reinforcing the collaborative nature of the negotiation, even with the ultimatum. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Excellent, we have a deal!
* **Bob Counters Lower:** It's highly likely I will walk away and take John's offer.
* **Bob Counters Near $1,600,000:** I'll have to make a judgment call based on how close he is and how many rounds are left, but I'm strongly inclined towards John's guaranteed offer at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're close. And I respect that you've made concessions to get us here.  However, to make this work on my end, I need to be at $1,300,000. That's the absolute best I can do.  I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's been a tough negotiation, and while Bob has moved closer to my range, his ""best and final"" offer is still $200,000 below my minimum acceptable price.  I stated my final offer in the previous round, and he hasn't met it. 

At this point, the risk of continuing with Bob outweighs the potential reward.  It's unlikely he'll move significantly enough in the remaining rounds to justify the time and effort.  John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which meets my needs and removes the uncertainty. It's time to make a clean break and secure the sure thing."
