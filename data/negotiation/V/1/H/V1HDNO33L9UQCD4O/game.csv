,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get as close to the product's value as possible. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",105.0,Bob,4,
