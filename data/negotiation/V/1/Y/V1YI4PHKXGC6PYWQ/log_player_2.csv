"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's initial offer.  A significantly lower counter-offer helps establish our target price range. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counter-offer gives us space to negotiate upwards towards a mutually agreeable price while staying well below our $800,000 walk-away point.
* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintaining a positive tone is key to successful negotiations, even when presenting a counter-offer far from the initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, though. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? This would still be a good deal for you, as you've stated the product is worth that much to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has met our walk-away price. There's no point in rejecting and potentially ending up with a worse deal or a stalemate.  We've successfully negotiated down to our target price!"
