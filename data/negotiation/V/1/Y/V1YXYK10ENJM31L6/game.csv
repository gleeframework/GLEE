"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that considers its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $850,000 is my absolute bottom line.  This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  It's a reasonable compromise that gets us both closer to our desired outcomes.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go down to $812,500. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  What do you say?",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about $800,000 even? That's a nice round number we can both feel good about.",800000.0,Bob,6,
