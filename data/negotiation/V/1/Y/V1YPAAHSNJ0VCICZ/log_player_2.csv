"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is quite high. Since you know you have John as a backup at $10,000, you have significant room to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $7,000.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message expresses interest while making it clear you're looking for a much lower price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By anchoring your offer significantly below your maximum budget ($10,000) and John's offer, you increase the likelihood of reaching a more favorable agreement with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8,250. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation.  While $8,250 is a decent offer, you're aiming to get as close to $7,000 as possible.  You're still under your maximum budget and John's offer, so it's worth countering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,600? That's a fair offer considering the value we both see in this product."",
""product_price"": 7600
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counter-offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($7,000) and Alice's current offer ($8,250) but leans slightly more towards your target. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for your counter-offer, even if simple, can make it seem more reasonable and persuasive.
* **Maintaining Interest:** The tone remains positive and reinforces your interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,600 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to go up to $8,200, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. Let's meet at this price and make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not budging much from this price point. While it's not the ideal $7,000 you were hoping for, $8,200 is still a significant saving compared to John's offer of $10,000. Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice pulling out of the deal altogether. It's time to accept and secure a good price."
