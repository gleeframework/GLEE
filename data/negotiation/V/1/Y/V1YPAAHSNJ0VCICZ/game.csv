"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $7,000.  Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8,250. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,600? That's a fair offer considering the value we both see in this product.",7600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,600 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to go up to $8,200, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. Let's meet at this price and make a deal.",8200.0,Alice,5,
