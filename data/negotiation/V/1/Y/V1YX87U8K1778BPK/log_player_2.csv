"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm open to negotiating a fair price.  I'm starting at $120, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $100 for it to be worth it.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is now meeting your maximum price, and there's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate further.  It's best to accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal."
