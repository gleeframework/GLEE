"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product. It's a game-changer in its industry and has the potential to revolutionize the way people work. I think it's worth every penny of its value to me, which is $15000. I'm willing to make a one-time exception and offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
