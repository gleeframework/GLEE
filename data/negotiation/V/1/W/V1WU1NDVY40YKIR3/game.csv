"Alice, $13,500 is far too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  $13,500 might have been a bit high, so I'm willing to come down to $11,500. I believe this product will bring you a lot of value and I'm keen to work out a deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  This product is valuable to me, but I'm not willing to pay more than that.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
