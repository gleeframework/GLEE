"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this excellent product for the price of $13,500.  I think it will be very valuable for you, and this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $13,500 is far too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  $13,500 might have been a bit high, so I'm willing to come down to $11,500. I believe this product will bring you a lot of value and I'm keen to work out a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still above my budget of $8,000. I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  This product is valuable to me, but I'm not willing to pay more than that.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $10,000 is still above my budget of $8,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, there's a limit to how much I'm willing to pay. It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $8,000. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely Alice will budge further."
