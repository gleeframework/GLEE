{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, but not outrageous. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear I'm open to a deal, which encourages Bob to engage.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to build rapport. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:** Depending on whether Bob accepts, rejects, or makes a counteroffer, I'll adjust my strategy. 
* **Potential Counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, I might lower the price slightly, but not drastically. 
* **John as a Backup:** I'll keep John in mind as a backup if the negotiation with Bob goes poorly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer meets my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if he's genuinely interested.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount, potentially securing a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll propose a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's current offer, creating room for further negotiation. 
* **Keep John in Mind:**  I'll keep John as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This still gives me some room, but also shows you how much I want to make this deal work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping the price, but not too far. 
* **Motivation:**  My message emphasizes my desire to make a deal, while still maintaining a firm price.
* **Potential for Agreement:** $12,500 is a halfway point between my initial offer and Bob's offer, making it a more likely point of agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully consider whether Bob accepts, rejects, or makes another counteroffer.
* **Adjust Strategy:** If Bob rejects, I'll consider adjusting my counteroffer strategy further, perhaps offering a slightly lower price or taking a more aggressive approach if I feel confident in my position.
* **John as a Backup:** I'll continue to keep John in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This is a fair compromise and shows how serious I am about buying this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial desired price, there's a risk that further negotiation might lead to a lower offer from Bob or him walking away entirely.
* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate might take more time, and I don't want to risk losing out on this deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept Offer:** By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that meets my minimum requirement and avoid the risk of further negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** While I'm accepting Bob's offer, I'll keep John in mind as a potential buyer for future products."
