"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is still higher than $700,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's split the difference and aim for $800,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and allows for a smooth transaction.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers and propose $825,000. This price takes into account the product's value to you while also reflecting my initial offer. I believe it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,
