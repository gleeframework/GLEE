Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your valuation, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly closer to my minimum, but I still have room to negotiate and try to secure a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but given my financial constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still some negotiating room. Bob's latest offer is a significant jump down, suggesting he might be willing to go a bit higher.  I'll try to push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,700,000 is appealing, I need to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $1,825,000?  It's a small compromise but would help me feel comfortable closing this deal."",
""product_price"": 1825000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is steadily moving towards my price, but his increments are getting smaller. This offer is a reasonable compromise, and continuing to push might risk him walking away. Accepting $1,750,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John."
