Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my potential profit and still being attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **It's more than my minimum:**  I'm getting more than my minimum of $8,000 if Bob rejects the offer.
* **It's less than Bob's value:**  Bob still gets a good deal since the product is worth $15,000 to him.  This makes it more likely he'll accept.

Let me know if you'd like me to analyze other offer strategies!"
