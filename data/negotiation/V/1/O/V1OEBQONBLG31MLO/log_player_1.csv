""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially secure a deal and still earn a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 creates a sense of urgency (limited-time offer) and presents a substantial discount compared to John's offer, making it more enticing for Bob.
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While Bob values the product at $1,000,000, the offer acknowledges that he may be willing to pay a premium for its potential benefits and the exclusivity of the deal."
