Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Considering its value, I'm setting the price at $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price of $10,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. This gives me a chance to still get a price higher than $8,000.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""value"" of the product aims to subtly justify the higher price, even though Bob may have a different perceived value."
