"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you'll get it for less than what it's worth to you, and I'll still make a decent profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
