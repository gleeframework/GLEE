"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above your budget of $8,000.  There's no reason to accept this offer. You should reject it and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't afford $20,000.  I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $14,000?  This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget.  You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is still higher than I can comfortably afford, I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This offer represents a significant discount from my original asking price and should be a very attractive price point for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above your budget of $8,000. You have a few options here:

* **Continue negotiating:** You could try to push for a lower price, but remember that you only have 5 rounds left.
* **Buy from John:**  You could go with the guaranteed price from John, especially if you feel like Alice won't come down further.

Given that you're still early in the negotiation process and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, it's worth attempting one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $12,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still at my limit with $10,000. This is a significant commitment for me, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal.  Would you be willing to consider my offer?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
