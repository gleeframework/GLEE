"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't afford $20,000.  I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $14,000?  This reflects the true value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is still higher than I can comfortably afford, I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This offer represents a significant discount from my original asking price and should be a very attractive price point for you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $12,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still at my limit with $10,000. This is a significant commitment for me, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal.  Would you be willing to consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,6,
