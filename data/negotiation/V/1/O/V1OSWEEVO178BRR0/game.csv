"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product name] that I think you'd really love. I'm asking $18000 for it. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the [product name], but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $15000? That's my absolute top limit.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $15000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $16500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16500 is still a bit above what I can comfortably spend.  How about we split the difference and go with $15750?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",15750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $15750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to $16000.  Would you consider $15900 as a final compromise?  It's a small step closer to your offer, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.",15900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $15900 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15800. This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work, I'll need to look at other options.",15800.0,Bob,6,
