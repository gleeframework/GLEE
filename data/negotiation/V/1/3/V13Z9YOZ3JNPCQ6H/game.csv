"I understand your position, Bob, but $10,000 is quite low for what I'm offering. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I can go.",12000.0,Bob,4,
