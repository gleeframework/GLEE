"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from the initial offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $900,000.  Would you consider $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get closer to $900,000, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a compromise that works for both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine, and settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the suggestion, Bob, but I think we can do better than $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair negotiation, but I need you to come down a bit more for this to work for me.  Would you consider $910,000?",910000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go much lower, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. If you're not comfortable with this, I'm happy to discuss further, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",920000.0,Alice,9,
