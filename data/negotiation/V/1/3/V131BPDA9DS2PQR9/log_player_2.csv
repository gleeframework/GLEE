"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go much lower, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. If you're not comfortable with this, I'm happy to discuss further, but I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

It's time to take the deal. Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and while we could try for another round, we risk her pulling back and the deal falling through. Accepting at $920,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
