"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's a chance you can get a better deal, even if you ultimately end up buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that might be considered reasonable.  This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate, but also firmly establishes my intention to pay significantly less than her initial asking price. I'm aiming to start a negotiation that can lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.  I still believe there's room for a better price, and I want to see if I can push Alice closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, but still staying below Alice's current price.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not willing to pay a price that's too far above my ideal target.  I believe this offer is still within a reasonable range, and it might be enough to convince Alice to accept and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired range, it's still above my budget. I'm going to continue negotiating. I'm confident that I can push for a price closer to $1,000,000. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to accept a counteroffer closer to my budget, especially since I've shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still below Alice's current price. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while maintaining my position of not exceeding my ideal target of $1,000,000. This counteroffer might be enough to convince Alice to accept, considering her last offer was already below her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now within my budget, I'm still going to reject it. I'm very close to my ideal price point, and I think I can get Alice to come down just a bit further. I've been consistent in my counteroffers, and I believe that with one more push, I can get her to accept a price of $1,000,000. There's no risk in rejecting this offer and trying one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I've shown a willingness to compromise throughout the negotiations, and I'm confident that Alice will accept my final offer. If she doesn't, I'll purchase the product from John, which is the same price I'm offering her. This is my best chance to get the product at my ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a strong resistance to dropping below $1,000,000.  It's clear that further negotiations are unlikely to yield a better price.  Since John is offering the product at my ideal price of $1,000,000, it's the most logical decision to buy from him and avoid any further negotiation with Alice."
