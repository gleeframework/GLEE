Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $80, while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $80, so I have nothing to lose by offering a slightly higher price."
