"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price, and still gives you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  Since Alice is willing to sell for less than $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,150,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you can potentially negotiate further, Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good deal. It's still within your budget and saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John."
