"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,150,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. ",1150000.0,Alice,3,
