Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price, and still gives you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that the price is beneficial for both of us, creating a sense of win-win.
* **Room for Counteroffers:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer without making me feel like I'm being taken advantage of. 
* **John as a Backup:** The knowledge that I have a backup buyer (John) gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob's counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I have a better chance of reaching a more favorable price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  He's already shown a willingness to compromise.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to hold firm and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,150,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:**  I'm not just rejecting his offer; I'm providing a clear reason for my counteroffer â€“  splitting the difference. 
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  By using the phrase ""fair profit margin,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the mutual benefit aspect of the negotiation.
* **Still Above Minimum:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
