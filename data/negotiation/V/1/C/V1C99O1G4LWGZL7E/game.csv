"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price is still very reasonable considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
