**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,400,000
* **Your maximum budget:** $1,500,000
* **John's offer:** $1,500,000

Since you can get the product from John for your maximum budget, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with John or find another seller.  You don't need to settle for Alice's price right away."
