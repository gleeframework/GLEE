"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're highlighting. However, $8,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,3,
