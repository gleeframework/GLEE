Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,490,000.  This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1490000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, our goal is to get the highest price possible. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,490,000) creates a sense of urgency and a good deal for Bob. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly pressures Bob to make a decision quickly.

This approach aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value while still leaving room for Alice to accept John's offer if Bob declines."
