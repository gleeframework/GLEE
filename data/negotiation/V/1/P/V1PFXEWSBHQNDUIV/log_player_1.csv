Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures you make a profit if he accepts.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $120 provides a safety net. It means you don't have to desperately lowball Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay beyond his perceived value."
