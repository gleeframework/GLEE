{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $115. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging a response from Bob, highlighting the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

* **Starting high:**  It's always better to start with a higher price and negotiate downwards. This gives you more room to compromise while still maximizing your profits.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The price of $115 is not my absolute bottom line. I'm willing to negotiate if needed.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm aware of John's offer of $120, but I'm not immediately jumping to that. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is too far off. 

**Strategy:**

* **Not accepting a low offer:**  Accepting Bob's offer would be a loss for me. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a better price.
* **Keeping John's offer in mind:**  I'm still aware of John's $120 offer, which gives me a solid fallback position.
* **Moving forward with a counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $105, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my minimum price. 
* **Message:** I'm reaffirming my belief in the product's value while keeping the tone positive and open to further discussion. 

**Strategy:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer signals that I'm taking Bob's offer seriously while not accepting it blindly. It's a good starting point for further negotiation.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $105 is still above my minimum of $120, so even if Bob accepts, I'm still making a profit.
* **Keeping John's offer in mind:** I'm still aware of John's offer and will be ready to accept it if the negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to settle for a loss.

**Strategy:**

* **Not accepting a low offer:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling the product below my minimum acceptable price, resulting in a loss.
* **Keeping John's offer in mind:**  John is still willing to pay $120, which is significantly better than Bob's offer.
* **Moving forward with a counteroffer:** I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round. My goal is to get closer to my minimum price or to reach a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $95 is still a bit lower than what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $100, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $105 and Bob's offer of $95. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also my commitment to getting a price closer to my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's continued interest while still maintaining a firm stance on my price. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer, hoping to encourage a deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Closing the gap:** This counteroffer brings us closer to a potential agreement, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.
* **Avoiding a loss:**  $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to sell for any less. 
* **Keeping John's offer in mind:** I'm still aware of John's offer and will be ready to accept it if Bob rejects my final offer."
