{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to get at least $8,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming high within Bob's valuation maximizes your potential profit.  
* **Urgency:**  Adding a time element (one-time offer) can encourage quicker decision-making.

By offering it at $12,000, you create a win-win scenario if Bob accepts:

* **Bob Wins:**  Gets the product for $3,000 less than his perceived value.
* **You Win:** You make a $4,000 profit over your guaranteed sale price."
