Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $800,000. He has reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation with Alice are minimal, and the risk of not reaching a deal is high.  Alice's offer of $915,000 is still too high for Bob, and with only 3 rounds remaining, the odds of getting a lower price are slim."
