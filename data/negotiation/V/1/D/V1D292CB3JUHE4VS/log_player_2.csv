"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, so it's a good deal. There's no reason to risk a counteroffer and potentially miss out on this price."
