Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob is ideal.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so offering it below that makes no sense.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and we can still negotiate downwards while staying above our minimum.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a time constraint can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without excessive deliberation."
