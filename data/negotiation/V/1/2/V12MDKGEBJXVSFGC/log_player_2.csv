"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if you're open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than the initial $18,000, it's still above his budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice, as he still has rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price reflects its value to me, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $12,500. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, $12,500 is still above his maximum of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice, as he still has rounds left and may be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and my limited budget. I hope you'll consider this final offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}
