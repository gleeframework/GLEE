"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still willing to make a deal. How about I meet you halfway and sell it to you for $135? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $135 is closer but still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $130? This way we can both walk away happy.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go down to $130 just yet. How about we meet in the middle again and I sell it to you for $132.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price.",132.5,Alice,5,
