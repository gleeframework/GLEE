Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to value:**  I emphasize the product's value to Bob to make the offer more attractive. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  By starting with a price higher than my minimum, I allow for a back and forth to find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **The fallback option:**  Remember, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations fail. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** 
* **I have leverage:** I can sell to John for a higher price.
* **It's worth trying to negotiate further:**  I'm not desperate to sell, so I'll counter and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, recognizing the value you see in the product. This is a fair compromise and still allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by reducing my price slightly.
* **Focus on fairness:** I highlight that the new price is a fair compromise, suggesting a win-win scenario. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  $1,250,000 is still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Leave the door open:**  I'm encouraging Bob to accept, but also allowing for the possibility of another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's position, but I still feel that $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I would like to propose a price of $1,225,000. This still allows Alice a good profit while keeping the cost reasonable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**
* **I have a guaranteed higher price with John:**  There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continued negotiation takes time and may not lead to a better outcome.  Selling to John ensures a quick and profitable transaction."
