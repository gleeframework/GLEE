# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1100000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers will be well worth it for you. Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1050000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000? I believe this price still represents a great value for you, and it allows us to both walk away with a fair deal.
