Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, attempting to sell to Bob first at a higher price could yield a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 positions it significantly below my minimum but still well above Bob's perceived value. This creates a strong incentive for Bob to consider the deal.
* **Exclusivity Element:** Highlighting that this is an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of urgency and importance to the offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
