Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to accept or move to John.
* **Justify the Price:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value to justify the high price without revealing your guaranteed sale to John. 

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
