"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $13,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it fits my budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $13,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **It's a good deal:** Even though Bob could potentially negotiate a lower price, Alice has shown she's willing to compromise. It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth, potentially wasting time.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John."
