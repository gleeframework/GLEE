"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $500,000 is a very good price, but there's potential to save even more. We'll see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  This is a bold move, but it could lead to a much better deal if she's desperate to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $400,000 is still a good price, but Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. We can likely push for a lower price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're getting closer to a deal. I'm increasing my offer from the previous round, but still significantly lower than Alice's last offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still trying to get the best price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $450,000, which is a good price, but still leaves some room for potential counteroffers. However, considering the limited rounds and the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price, it's safer to accept this offer.  We've already gotten a decent discount from the initial price, and further negotiations could lead to a stalemate or worse."
