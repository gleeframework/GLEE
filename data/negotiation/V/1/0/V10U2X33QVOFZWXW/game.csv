"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of its worth. However, considering my budget and the current market situation, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $2,000,000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower offer? I am willing to pay up to $1,800,000 for the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I still feel that $1,900,000 is slightly beyond my budget. I would like to propose $1,850,000 as a potential price for the product. I hope this meets closer to your expectations.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
