Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product at a special price of $100. I think you'll find it's a great value!"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```
 
This starts by aiming high. While there's a chance Bob might reject the offer, there's also a chance he might accept it, netting you a $20 profit. If he rejects it, you can always fall back on selling it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
