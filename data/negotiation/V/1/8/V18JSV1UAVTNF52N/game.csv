"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $12000, which would be $11000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $9500 is still a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $10500. I think this price reflects the product's value and is a fair offer considering the market conditions.",10500.0,Alice,5,,
