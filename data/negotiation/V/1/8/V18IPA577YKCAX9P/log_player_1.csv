{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a lower price, and I get to move this quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives me a healthy profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer, but it's also close enough to John's offer that I'm not losing out too much if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and my value for the product. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,000,000? This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
