"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to get a decent return on my investment. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can consider it. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
