"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $2000000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1200000 is far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This price reflects both the product's worth and our potential for a successful partnership. Let's bridge the gap.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1450000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1600000. This price is still fair given the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1600000 is closer, it's still above my budget. My final offer is $1500000. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll need to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
