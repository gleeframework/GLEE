"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. My initial offer for the product is $1,800,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in acquiring it, but I can only go as high as $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,300,000 is your maximum budget, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,550,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you receive a respectable profit. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a decent profit. My counteroffer is $1,600,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a good profit, but I'm still struggling to justify $1,600,000. I'm going to offer a final price of $1,450,000.  This is a very reasonable compromise that will allow me to acquire the product while still ensuring you receive a substantial profit. Let's make this deal happen.",1450000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,600,000. I'm starting to think that we might be at an impasse. However, I'm still interested in selling the product to you. My final counteroffer is $1,580,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can find a deal.",1580000.0,Alice,7,
