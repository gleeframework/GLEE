"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can definitely get a better price than $950,000.  Alice values the product at $800,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still allows for a good profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate further.  There's still a gap between Alice's desired price and Bob's maximum. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially close the gap even more."
