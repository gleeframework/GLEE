"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,
