Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm asking $13,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $13,000 as my initial offer. This is a price that's lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but higher than my minimum acceptable price, giving me some room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I've included a message to Bob that highlights the product's value to him and positions my offer as fair.

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a good price:** My initial offer is likely to be accepted by Bob, as it's below his perceived value of the product.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers, I have the opportunity to counter his offer and potentially get a higher price.
* **Provide a safety net:** I'm also aware of John's offer, so I can walk away from the negotiation with Bob if his counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've countered with $11,500. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to his valuation of the product. It allows for potential negotiation while remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:**  I've again emphasized the value of the product and framed my counteroffer as a fair compromise. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain a strong position:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Close the gap:** My counteroffer brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price, increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation.
* **Stay above my minimum:** $11,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, ensuring I'm not selling the product for less than it's worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and is closer to my desired price than John's offer of $10,000. Accepting this offer will give me a decent profit while also avoiding further negotiation."
