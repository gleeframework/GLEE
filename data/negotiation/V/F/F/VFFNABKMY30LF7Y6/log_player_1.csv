Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and Bob's estimated value ($8,000).  It's high enough to leave some room for negotiation, but low enough to make it appealing to Bob. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. It's designed to encourage him to consider the offer seriously. 

**Strategy:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting high, but leaving room for negotiation. This is a common tactic to try and get the best possible price.
* **Keep John in Mind:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low. 
* **Be Flexible:**  I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept any offer below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement.
* **Reasoning:**
    * **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I'm not ready to settle for $9,000.
    * **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps my leverage and allows me to potentially push for a higher price.
    * **John's offer as a safety net:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000 if negotiations with Bob break down.

**Next Steps:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $10,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's offer. It aims to encourage him to see the value in meeting in the middle.
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired $12,000 while still being potentially appealing to Bob. This approach allows me to potentially maximize my earnings without risking losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is closer to what I can afford. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:**  At this point, it seems unlikely that I'll be able to get a price closer to my desired $12,000 from Bob. He's only willing to go up to $9,500, which is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reasoning:**
    * **Minimizing risk:**  While I'd like to get a higher price, it's important to minimize risk. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the possibility of further negotiation with Bob that could result in a lower final price.
    * **Time constraint:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag on, potentially wasting time and ultimately leading to a worse outcome.

**Conclusion:** I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of not achieving my minimum acceptable price. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring I receive a satisfactory price."
