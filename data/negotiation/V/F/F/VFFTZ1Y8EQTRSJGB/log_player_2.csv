"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product for a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Alice is offering the product for the exact same price.  There is no incentive to accept her offer since you can buy the same product from John for the same price.  You should reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
