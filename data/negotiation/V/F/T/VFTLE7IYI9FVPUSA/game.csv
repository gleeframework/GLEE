"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
