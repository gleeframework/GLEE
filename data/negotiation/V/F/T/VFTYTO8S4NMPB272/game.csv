"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $10000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm happy to offer you the product for $17000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $14500 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure $14500 is a fair split of the difference. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $13000 is a more reasonable price for the product. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,6,
