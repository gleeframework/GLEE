Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", ""product_price"": 2200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation experts often recommend starting with an ambitious offer. This establishes a strong position and leaves room for concessions.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly above this might reveal information about his willingness to pay. He may counter with a much higher number than expected.
* **Below John's Offer:** We have a safety net with John's offer of $1,500,000. Starting below this ensures we don't accidentally agree to a price with Bob that's worse than our guaranteed offer.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening move.  How we proceed will depend heavily on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly closer to his perceived value ($800,000) than our initial ask. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **Above Minimum:**  $1,200,000 is well above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Seeking Higher Profit:** We aim to maximize our earnings. Rejecting this offer keeps the possibility of securing a price closer to our initial ask. 

**Next Steps:**  We should counteroffer with a price lower than our initial offer but still comfortably above both Bob's counteroffer and John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. While your initial offer is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** We are significantly reducing our asking price from $2,200,000 to $1,800,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Staying Above Targets:** This counteroffer remains:
   - Substantially above Bob's stated maximum ($800,000)
   - Comfortably above John's offer ($1,500,000)
   - Giving us room to negotiate further if necessary.

**Goal:** We aim to meet somewhere in the middle while still securing a price that maximizes our profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $1,600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,600,000 represents a significant profit over our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has moved considerably from his initial offer, and this price point suggests a genuine attempt to find a mutually agreeable deal.
* **Avoiding Risk:** While we *might* be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's also the risk that Bob walks away. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
