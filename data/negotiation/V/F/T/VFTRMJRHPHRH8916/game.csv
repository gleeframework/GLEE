"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? I believe this would still provide a good return on investment for you while allowing me to stay within my financial limits.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see you're trying to work within your budget.  However, $1,100,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1,150,000? This would allow me to move forward and give you a good deal on a valuable product.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
