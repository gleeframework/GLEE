Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $112. I've already compromised a bit by meeting you halfway earlier. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but $112 is my minimum. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm open to discussing further.
