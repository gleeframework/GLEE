"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to let it go for a price of $950000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it hard to pass up.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential value,  $950000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider a price of $850000? This would allow us to close the deal quickly and efficiently.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $900000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value I see in the product.  How about we settle at $875000? This would be a win-win situation, allowing us to finalize the deal without further delay.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $885000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",885000.0,Alice,5,
