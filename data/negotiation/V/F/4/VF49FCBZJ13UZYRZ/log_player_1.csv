Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm looking to invest a bit less. How about we consider a price closer to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price, however, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
