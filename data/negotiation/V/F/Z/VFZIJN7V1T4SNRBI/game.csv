"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000.  What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we settle somewhere in the middle, say around $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $11,500 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Could you consider $9,500?  I think that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  It seems like we are getting closer. How about we split the difference again and agree on $10,500? I'm motivated to sell, but I need to ensure it's a fair deal for me as well.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to go up a bit, but $10,500 is still a touch over my budget.  How about we settle at $10,200? That's a firm offer from my side.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I appreciate your willingness to move up on the price.  How about we make this our final offer: $10,350.  That's right in the middle and would allow us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.  What do you say?",10350.0,Alice,7,
