"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum of $150, it's still a significant mark-up from Alice's own valuation of $80.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $95 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $120, while still offering her a profit margin of $15. This allows for a potential middle ground where we can both reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $105 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $100. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my valuation.  This offer should be attractive to Alice, as it provides her with a $20 profit."
