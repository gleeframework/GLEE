"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $120. This is a fair price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. I believe this price is fair and allows for both of us to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $100 is closer to my desired price point and significantly higher than selling to John. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
