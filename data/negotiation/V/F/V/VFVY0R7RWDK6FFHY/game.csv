"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $100. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I am interested,  $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, I'm still hoping to find something closer to my budget. Would you be willing to consider $90?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
