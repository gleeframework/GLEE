{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to capitalize on his potential willingness to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter and hopefully find a mutually agreeable price. But I'm always aware of John's offer of $8,000, which provides a safety net and limits my downside."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still below my target price. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a more favorable deal.  I'm confident that I can get a better price, and I'm not afraid to walk away if needed.  John's offer provides me with a solid fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still holding out for a price closer to my desired target. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also maintaining a price point that provides me with a satisfactory profit.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that Bob may be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's latest offer is just slightly below my minimum.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original goal,  it's getting late in the negotiation and the risk of further rounds leading to a worse deal or a stalemate is high.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale at a decent price, ensuring I don't miss out on a potential profit."
