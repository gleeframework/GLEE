"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, however, $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, how about we settle on $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the product's value, I am unable to meet your current proposal at $12,000. I would like to suggest a price of $11,000. This still allows me to respect the product's worth while staying within my budget. I look forward to your consideration.",11000.0,Bob,4,
