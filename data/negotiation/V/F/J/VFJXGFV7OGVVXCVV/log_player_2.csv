Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $12,500 is the lowest I can go. I'm confident this product will bring you a lot of value exceeding that cost. What do you say, deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

``` 

Alice seems firm on her $12,500 price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she won't budge and I'll end up paying more through John. Accepting now guarantees a saving compared to John's offer."
