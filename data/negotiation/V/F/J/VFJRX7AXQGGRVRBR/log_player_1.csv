Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  This is a fair price, considering it's still a significant investment for me and allows us both to walk away happy.
