Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 10 rounds and a backup buyer willing to pay my minimum.  I will continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,250,000 is far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still slightly over my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering your previous offer and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum. I'm confident we can negotiate further.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise further, but $1,300,000 is still below my bottom line. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,325,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,325,000. Let's stick with my previous offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached an impasse.  Bob is unwilling to budge beyond $1,300,000, which is still below my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further rounds failing is high.  John is a guaranteed buyer at my desired price, so selling to him is the most logical and profitable option at this point."
