{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,250,000 is far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still slightly over my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise further, but $1,300,000 is still below my bottom line. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,325,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is close to his budget, he's already made a counteroffer at $1,300,000. It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to budge a little further. There's still a chance she might accept his previous offer, or come down a bit more."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,325,000. Let's stick with my previous offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
