"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,250,000 is far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to compromise further, but $1,300,000 is still below my bottom line. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,325,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget. Let's make this deal happen.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,325,000. Let's stick with my previous offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement on this.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
