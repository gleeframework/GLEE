Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,500,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have room to start high. Aiming for $1,500,000 allows for potential negotiation downward while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone suggests willingness to discuss the price, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know about John's offer. In a real negotiation, information is key."
