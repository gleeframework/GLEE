"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,150,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,125,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider going back to your original offer and meeting me halfway at $1,125,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not able to go lower than $1,125,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well. I'm not willing to go any lower at this point, but I'm open to finalizing the deal at this price. What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,125,000, which would be $1,112,500. Can you consider this price?",1112500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price we can both agree on.  However, I'm still firm on my offer of $1,125,000.  This price represents a fair value for the product and gives us both a good deal. If you're willing to accept this, we can close the deal now. Otherwise, I'll be forced to consider other offers.
