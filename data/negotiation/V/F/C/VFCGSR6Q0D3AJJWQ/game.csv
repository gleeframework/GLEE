"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $50 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $50 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $120 to be comfortable with the sale. How about we try $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, which is the lowest I can go. Can we meet at this price?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but I'm really not willing to go above $90. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90 for the product. Can you consider accepting this price?",90.0,Bob,6,
