"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not quite ready to pay $10,000. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",9000.0,Bob,4,
