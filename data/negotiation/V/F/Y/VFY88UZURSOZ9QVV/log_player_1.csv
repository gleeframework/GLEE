{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a price that is higher than my minimum value of $120, giving me some profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming for a price that is likely attractive but not so high that he will definitely reject it. If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John for $120, which is still a safe fallback."
