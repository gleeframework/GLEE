Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I've already gone lower than I'm comfortable with.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $100. While you could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll budge further. You have a guaranteed option with John for $80, which saves you $20 and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
