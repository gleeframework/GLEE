"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a steal at $1,199,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe its true value far exceeds this price. It's a unique opportunity that you won't find elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,199,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,199,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is much higher than your $800,000 limit and John's offer. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John directly."
