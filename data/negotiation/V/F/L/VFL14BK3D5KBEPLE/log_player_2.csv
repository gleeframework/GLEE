It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John.  You can still get a good deal from Alice, and it's worth exploring that possibility."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice's offer is the best you've received. It's still slightly more than you'd like to pay, but it's lower than John's price and getting a lower price from Alice might take too much time and effort."
