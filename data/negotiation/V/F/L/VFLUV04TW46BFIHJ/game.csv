"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $9,500?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,250 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to purchase the product within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
