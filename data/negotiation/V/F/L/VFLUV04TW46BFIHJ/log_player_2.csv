Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $9,500?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
