"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,250,000?  This is still a significant savings for you compared to its value to you, and it's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
