"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50?  It's still a good deal for both of us.",97.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $97.5 is still a little too high.  I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $93.75? It's a good compromise, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product.",93.75,Alice,5,
