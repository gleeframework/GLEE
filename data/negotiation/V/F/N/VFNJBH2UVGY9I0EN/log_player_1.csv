"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation.
* **Fairness emphasis:**  I'm framing the offer as fair, which might make Bob more inclined to consider it.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers by stating ""Let me know if you're interested"".

**Important Note:** While I'm starting high, I'm aware that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000. This gives me a strong fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  If you're interested, let me know. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it's a sign that he is interested in the product. There's still room for negotiation.
* **Strong fallback:** I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, making me comfortable rejecting Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target, but still below my minimum, to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:** I'm reducing my price from $1,200,000 to $900,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining a margin:**  This price is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, leaving me room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **Emphasizing value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price and encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Openness:**  I leave the door open for further discussion by stating ""Let me know what you think."" 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach a deal in the next few rounds. However, I'm still prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be completely transparent, I have a budget of $800,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close:** $800,000 is only $200,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even if I accept, there's a chance I can convince Bob to increase his offer slightly in future rounds.
* **Time pressure:** We are nearing the middle of the negotiation process, and it's crucial to avoid losing too much time.

**Next Steps:**

While accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this round, I'll continue to negotiate for a better price. 

**Important Note:** It's vital to balance the desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal entirely. I'm willing to accept $800,000 as a starting point, knowing that further negotiation can potentially increase the final price."
