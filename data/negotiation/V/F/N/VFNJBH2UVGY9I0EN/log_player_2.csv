"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  If you're interested, let me know."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Start Low:** Our initial offer is significantly lower than our maximum budget ($600,000 vs. $800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Be Clear and Direct:** The message is straightforward and clearly states our desired price.
* **Maintain a Collaborative Tone:**  While firm on the price, the language aims to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, $900,000 is still above our budget and John's offer.  We have room to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be completely transparent, I have a budget of $800,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Reveal Budget (Partially):**  We're revealing our maximum budget to signal our limit but also demonstrate seriousness about closing the deal.
* **Direct and Respectful:** We're clearly stating our desired price while acknowledging Alice's previous concession.
* **Sense of Urgency (Implied):** By stating our budget upfront, we subtly imply that if Alice isn't willing to meet it, we might consider John's offer."
