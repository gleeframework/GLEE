Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1500000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe I can potentially get a better price if I keep negotiating with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,750,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value and the market conditions. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,600,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's above my minimum threshold and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing the sale altogether."
