"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the budget, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1100000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1150000. This is a compromise, but I think it's a good deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above the budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1125000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1125000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
