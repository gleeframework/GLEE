"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's try $16,000. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to make sure I get a fair value for this product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're willing to go up to $14,000, but I'm still a little hesitant.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  That would allow me to fairly value the product while still giving you a good deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,
