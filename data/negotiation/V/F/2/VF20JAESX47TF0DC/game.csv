"Alice,  while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm offering $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects a fair value based on our previous discussions and my budget.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting close!  I recognize your position and I'm committed to making this work.  My final offer is $1,050,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end and ensures a fair deal for both of us. I have another interested buyer, but I believe in giving you the first opportunity. Please consider this carefully, as I need a decision this round.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However,  $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm ready to pay $975,000, which reflects a significant step towards your last offer and a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and make this a win-win situation.",975000.0,Bob,6,
