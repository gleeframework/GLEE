"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchor High:** By setting a high initial price, we ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if Bob rejects the offer, his counteroffer will likely be closer to our desired range.
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception. 
 
It's important to note that this is just the opening move. We'll need to adapt our strategy based on Bob's responses in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm offering $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  We have ample room to negotiate and plenty of rounds left.  We'll use the next round to counter with a price closer to our target while still encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It's clear we both see the value in this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered and leaves room for a profitable outcome for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a substantial concession from our initial price to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and signal that we're moving towards a deal. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""true worth"" and aiming for a ""mutually profitable outcome,"" we reinforce the value proposition and imply that this is a fair and reasoned counteroffer.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While moving closer to Bob's offer, we're still significantly above his initial price, keeping the pressure on him to move closer to our acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects a fair value based on our previous discussions and my budget.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer! Bob's offer is now at $950,000, but it's still below our absolute minimum of $1,000,000. We have several rounds left to negotiate, and we can use the guaranteed offer from John as leverage.  We'll counter with a price closer to our target, signaling that we're nearing our bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I recognize your position and I'm committed to making this work.  My final offer is $1,050,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end and ensures a fair deal for both of us. I have another interested buyer, but I believe in giving you the first opportunity. Please consider this carefully, as I need a decision this round."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're making a smaller concession this time ($50,000 instead of $100,000), indicating we're reaching our limit. 
* **Finality:**  Stating ""final offer"" and emphasizing the need for a decision creates a sense of urgency.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning the other buyer (John) reminds Bob that we have a strong alternative and adds pressure to accept. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Our price is now slightly above our minimum, giving us a small buffer if Bob makes a final counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However,  $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm ready to pay $975,000, which reflects a significant step towards your last offer and a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and make this a win-win situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to meet our minimum price of $1,000,000.  While we could continue negotiating, we risk Bob becoming entrenched and potentially losing the guaranteed offer from John. It's time to cut our losses and take the sure thing.  By selling to John, we secure our minimum acceptable profit and avoid the risk of Bob not budging."
