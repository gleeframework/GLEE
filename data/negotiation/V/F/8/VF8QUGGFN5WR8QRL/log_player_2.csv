"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to beat.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on the product while also being a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. Considering your offer of $850000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your desire for a better price. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $862,500.  This demonstrates my sincere interest in purchasing this product and allows us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 862500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $862500. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you at $870000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find acceptable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down on the price, but $870,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone. There's still some wiggle room for negotiation, and you're not quite ready to go with John's offer yet. It's worth one more attempt to see if you can close the deal at a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $870,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $865,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the very last offer I can make. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 865000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close, and I appreciate your willingness to make one final offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $865000. Considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you at $868000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find acceptable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $868,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $868,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $868,000 is only $8,000 above your target price of $860,000. This is a reasonable compromise, especially considering the value of the product to you and the fact that you have limited rounds left.  It's better to secure the product now at a price slightly higher than your ideal than risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
