"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $10500. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $8000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10500 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm happy to pay $9000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'll offer you the product for $10000, which is still a good deal considering its value to you. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
