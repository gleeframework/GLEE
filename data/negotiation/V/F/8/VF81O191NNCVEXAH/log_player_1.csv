Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, it hints at the product's worth and the exclusivity of the offer.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a safety net â€“ John is willing to buy the product at Bob's valuation. This allows Alice to confidently aim higher with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If Alice knows Bob is very price-sensitive, she might want to slightly lower her initial offer to avoid an immediate rejection. 
* **Product Uniqueness:** If the product is highly unique and Bob really needs it, Alice might be able to push for an even higher price."
