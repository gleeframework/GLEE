Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price downward, but I won't go below my minimum of $15,000 (by selling to John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,500 is too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This would still leave you a good deal, and it's closer to my value for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,500, so how about we try $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,250 is closer to my minimum price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired amount. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, aiming for a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $10,250 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to compromise a little more, but  $10,750 is my final offer.  This would give you a good price and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $10,750 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would prefer to sell to Bob,  $10,500 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired amount, and it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob."
