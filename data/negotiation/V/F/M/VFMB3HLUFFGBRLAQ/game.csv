"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,500 is too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This would still leave you a good deal, and it's closer to my value for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,500, so how about we try $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $10,250 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to compromise a little more, but  $10,750 is my final offer.  This would give you a good price and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if that works for you.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $10,750 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,6,
