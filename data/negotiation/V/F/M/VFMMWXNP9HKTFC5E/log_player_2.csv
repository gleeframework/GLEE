"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's important to negotiate a lower price to get closer to the product's actual value.  We have plenty of rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I think the price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's opening offer, but it's still above her perceived value of the product. This gives us room to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll see a fantastic return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $11,000 is still too high. We can afford to be patient and continue negotiating. We'll aim slightly lower in our next counteroffer to guide the negotiation in the right direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $11,000 is a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider $10,000? I feel that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that works well for us. By suggesting a specific number, we're guiding the negotiation towards a range we're comfortable with."
