"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I know it's a bit on the higher side, but it's a unique piece and I believe it's worth it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a stronger starting position.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the high price, emphasizing the product's uniqueness. 
* **Openness:** I'm inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation by asking for his thoughts.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just the first offer. The strategy will evolve based on Bob's responses.
* I'm always aware of John's offer of $15,000, which is my floor price. 
* I will adjust my offers and counteroffers based on Bob's reactions and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $14,000. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While $14,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. There are still 8 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can push Bob higher. 
* **Exploring Options:** By rejecting, I keep the negotiation open and have the opportunity to counter with a price closer to my target.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, but I'm aiming for a higher profit. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than his offer, trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price.  
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** I'm inviting further negotiation by suggesting we find a compromise. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to slowly push Bob towards a higher price while staying above my floor price and leaving room for further negotiations in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'd like to propose a price of $15,000. This is the highest I can go, given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:**  Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This is a good deal for me, as it meets my floor price and allows me to close the deal without any further risk.
* **Avoiding Risk:** While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that I could get a higher price, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further rounds.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for the same price offers no advantage over selling to Bob. It's better to close the deal with Bob, as he's already shown willingness to negotiate and is potentially a future customer."
