"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $14,000. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
