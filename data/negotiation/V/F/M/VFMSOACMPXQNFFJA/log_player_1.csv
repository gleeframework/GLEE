Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is more than your minimum of $100, meaning you'll be happy with the deal if Bob accepts.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $120, so there's potential for him to counteroffer, and for you to find a price you're both happy with.
* **It's polite and friendly:** A friendly tone can encourage Bob to be more open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  You can counter with a price closer to your original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $108 is close to your minimum of $100, and it's likely you won't get a better offer from him.  It's better to accept and close the deal."
