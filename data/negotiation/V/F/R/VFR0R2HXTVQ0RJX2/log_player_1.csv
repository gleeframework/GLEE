Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This allows for potential counteroffers and a negotiation process. 
* **It's a fair starting point:**  It gives Bob an incentive to counteroffer, but also leaves you room to negotiate upward if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints.  However, $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can make a deal work at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to risk going any lower.  John has already offered my minimum, and I'd rather guarantee myself that amount.  It's time to end the negotiations with Bob and sell to John."
