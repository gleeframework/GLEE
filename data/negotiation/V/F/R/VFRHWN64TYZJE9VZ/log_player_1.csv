This offer is slightly above the minimum value I'm willing to accept, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me a healthy profit margin. I've also added a friendly message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept an offer that undervalues my product. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer of $725,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I'll get from the product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $737,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm going to make a new offer of $712,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.
