Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a wise investment."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob's value for the product is unknown. This sets the initial bar and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Confidence and Value:**  I'm highlighting the value and opportunity to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Safety Net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations fail. This gives me a fallback and limits my potential losses.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he counters, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While Bob has shown interest, he clearly values the product less than I do. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation allows me to explore better options without accepting a price that would be detrimental to my financial goals.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price higher than $1,200,000 but lower than my initial offer. I aim to find a middle ground while still ensuring I receive a reasonable price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,750,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves us both with a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of my counteroffer, suggesting a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Maintaining Value:**  My counteroffer remains above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've secured a favorable price. If he rejects, I'll need to reassess the situation and consider whether to counter again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting this offer would ensure I don't lose money and achieve my goal of selling the product for at least $1,500,000.
* **No Further Negotiation:**  While I could continue negotiations, there's no guarantee that Bob would be willing to go higher, and I could risk losing him as a buyer. 
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer avoids further back-and-forth, saving time and effort. 

**Next Steps:**

I will finalize the sale to Bob for $1,500,000."
