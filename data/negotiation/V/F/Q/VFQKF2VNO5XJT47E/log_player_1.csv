Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value is quite high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $87? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure I can afford it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
While I could push for a bit more, $87 is a solid profit above my minimum. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk losing Bob entirely and having to settle for $80 from John."
