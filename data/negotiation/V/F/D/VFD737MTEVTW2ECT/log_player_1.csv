Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, knowing that I can always sell to John for that amount. This establishes a strong starting point and forces Bob to make the first concession if he wants to purchase the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a lower price than Bob's offer, but higher than my minimum, to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering $950,000, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up slightly, and at this point, the negotiation is getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer will save time and ensure a sale without risking a further decline in price."
