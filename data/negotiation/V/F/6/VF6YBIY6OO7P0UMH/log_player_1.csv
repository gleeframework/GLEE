``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum, but still within a reasonable range for Bob considering the product is worth $800,000 to him. It leaves room for negotiation, but also demonstrates that you're serious about selling the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $750,000 is still a decent amount, it's below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $780000, but no more. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $780,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a price closer to $800,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little ways from my target price. How about $790,000?  That would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price you can work with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 790000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're still looking for a bit more, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so how about $785000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $785,000 is close to my minimum, it's still below what I want to get for the product.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $800,000, I'll go ahead and sell to him.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing a valuable sale."
