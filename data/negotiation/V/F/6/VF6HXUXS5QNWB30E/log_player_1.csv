Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 difference where both you and Bob can profit.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to price Bob out. A good strategy is to aim high, leaving room for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still staying above your minimum.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to frame the product desirably.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,150,000 allows Bob to potentially negotiate down while keeping you well above your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Justification:** You subtly remind Bob of the potential return on investment, justifying the high price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. Your goal is to find a price within that $200,000 range that satisfies both parties."
