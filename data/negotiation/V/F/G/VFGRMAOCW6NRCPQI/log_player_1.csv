Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $10,000 is too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth $12,000 to him. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $10,000, I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer you the product for $12,500.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget with $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $11,250 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not where I want it to be. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal before I move on to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price.  Let's try one more time. I'll come down to $11,750, which is a fair compromise for both of us. If you accept, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 11750}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to be careful with my finances. I'll meet you at $11,500, and that's my final offer. If you're willing to accept it, we can move forward with the deal.

Bob's offer is getting close, but I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'm willing to walk away from this deal and sell to John for $12,000.  I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but it seems we're at an impasse."
