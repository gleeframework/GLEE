,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $10,000, I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer you the product for $12,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I need to get for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget with $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $11,250 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price.  Let's try one more time. I'll come down to $11,750, which is a fair compromise for both of us. If you accept, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to be careful with my finances. I'll meet you at $11,500, and that's my final offer. If you're willing to accept it, we can move forward with the deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
