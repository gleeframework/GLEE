Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also being upfront and positive in my message to build rapport and encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm aiming to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we split the difference at $1,200,000?  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
