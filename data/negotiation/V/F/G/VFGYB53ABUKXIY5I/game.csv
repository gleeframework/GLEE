"Alice, I appreciate you offering this product. However, $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is below what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant benefit.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which is closer to my budget and represents a good value for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,175,000. I believe this is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber. What do you say?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
