Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is below what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above your desired price point. Rejecting and counter-offering again allows you to continue negotiating towards a more favorable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still slightly above your budget. It's getting close, but the risk of further negotiation and a potential stalemate makes buying from John the more secure and cost-effective option at this point. You can get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000, avoiding the uncertainty of further bargaining."
