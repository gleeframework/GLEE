Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $160 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and creates the perception of value. 
* **Leaving Room:**  Even though Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay a bit more. Starting at $160 gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price well above your $120 minimum. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You always have the option to sell to John for $120, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $100 is closer to his perceived value of the product but still significantly below your minimum of $120.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate between his offer and your minimum price. By rejecting, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of selling to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm motivated to sell, $100 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting to ""meet halfway,"" you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $130 is still a profitable price for you, exceeding your minimum by $10.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This counteroffer will help you gauge how serious Bob is about buying the product and how much he's willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Unlikely to Budge:** Bob has indicated he needs to ""stay within his budget,"" suggesting he's unlikely to increase his offer substantially.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $120, ensuring you don't make a loss.

It's better to take the guaranteed profit with John rather than continue negotiating with Bob and potentially ending up with an even lower offer or no sale at all."
