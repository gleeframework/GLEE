I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering at $1,250,000. This is still a good profit for me and is closer to my minimum acceptable price. I hope this will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to drop my price further. While $1,200,000 isn't ideal, it's my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a much lower offer.  I'll sell to John."
