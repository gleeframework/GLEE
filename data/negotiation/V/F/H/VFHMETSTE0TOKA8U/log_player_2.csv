"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $750,000 is better than John's price, there's room for further negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we try 725000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. While Alice's offer is getting closer to his target, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but 725,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference again and go with 712,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 712500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at 715000, which is still a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $715,000 is very close to Bob's target price of $700,000.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will only result in small changes to the price, and the risk of Alice walking away is increasing.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking losing the deal altogether."
