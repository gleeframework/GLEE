Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I know you've been interested in, for a price that I believe is fair and mutually beneficial. I'm sure you'll agree that it's a fantastic deal.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing the details further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is designed to be friendly and encouraging. It acknowledges Bob's interest in the product and frames the offer as a mutually beneficial opportunity. It leaves room for further negotiation and discussion.
* **Product price:** The price is set at $1,000,000, which is the minimum value for Alice. This ensures she gets her desired amount and also leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy balances the desire for maximum profit with the need to secure a sale. By offering the product at the minimum acceptable price, Alice maximizes her potential earnings while still making the offer appealing enough for Bob to consider. This approach is likely to lead to a successful negotiation and a positive outcome for both parties."
