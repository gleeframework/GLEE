# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  $12,000 is too low for me."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about $11,500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $15,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

While $11,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'll make one final counteroffer before considering John's offer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and my budget of $15,000, which would be $13,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750

$13,750 is a good compromise and still brings a decent profit. I'll accept Bob's offer."
