"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I agree that this product has value, however, I need the price to be significantly lower for it to make sense for me.  I propose $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $650,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value that I believe you're undervaluing. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $925,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value proposition, but $925,000 is still too high for my budget. Let's find a middle ground - how about $750,000? This demonstrates my seriousness while acknowledging the product's worth.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about reaching a deal, and I respect that.  While $750,000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal quickly.  My final offer is $850,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to work with you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $775,000. This is my final offer, as I need to stay within a strict budget on this acquisition.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but I need to be firm on my end.  $812,500 is the absolute lowest I can go. This is a fair deal considering the true value of the product.",812500.0,Alice,7,
