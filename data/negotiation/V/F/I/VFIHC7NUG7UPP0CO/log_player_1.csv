{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value.  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not keen on selling at that price right away. There's still room to negotiate, and I'd like to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $8,200 is only $200 less than my minimum acceptable price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower offer or having to sell to John for $8,000.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit."
