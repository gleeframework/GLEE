,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need.",110.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $112. This is my final offer.",112.0,Alice,5,
