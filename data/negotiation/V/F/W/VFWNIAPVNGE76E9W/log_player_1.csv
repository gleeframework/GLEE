{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, giving you some room for negotiation, but still low enough that it's likely he'll consider it. This approach balances the risk of him rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit.  We'll see what his response is and adjust our strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a loss for me.  While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I'm not willing to accept a price that low. I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $11,500?  This would still leave us both with a good deal, and I'm confident we can finalize this quickly."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $11,500. This is a compromise - it's higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer.  It shows good faith,  but still allows me to make a decent profit.  This strategy aims to reach a mutually acceptable price without risking losing Bob entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price.  I believe that  Bob is genuinely interested in the product, and I'm willing to continue negotiating for a slightly better deal.  If he rejects my next counteroffer, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation and appreciate your willingness to work with me.  $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's settle at $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal now."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $11,250, which is a small increase from Bob's offer but still leaves some room for profit. This offer demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while also aiming to get closer to my desired price point.  I hope this will encourage Bob to accept, as it's likely the best offer he will get.  If he rejects, I'll consider selling to John, but I'm hopeful this offer will close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,100. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I've reached the point where I'm not willing to sacrifice further. It's clear that we can't agree on a price that satisfies both of us.  Rather than continuing this negotiation and potentially risking further rejection, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000 to guarantee a profit."
