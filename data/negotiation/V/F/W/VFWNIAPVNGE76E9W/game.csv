,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $11,500?  This would still leave us both with a good deal, and I'm confident we can finalize this quickly.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. Can you consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation and appreciate your willingness to work with me.  $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's settle at $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal now.",11250.0,Alice,5,
