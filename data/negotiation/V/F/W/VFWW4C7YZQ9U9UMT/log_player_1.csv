"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to get a good deal. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my minimum if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while also showing Bob that I'm confident in the value of the product."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm making a final push towards my target price. This offer shows my commitment to negotiating while demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise.  This offer is also close enough to Bob's valuation that he might be inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a price closer to my initial target, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and secures a profit, minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether.  It's a good compromise given the circumstances."
