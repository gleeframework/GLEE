"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage with the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** While I'm not revealing specific details about the product, I'm suggesting it's ""fantastic"" to pique Bob's interest.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth continuing the negotiation.
* I'll always have the option to sell to John for $100 if I'm not satisfied with the progress of the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still a significant discount from my initial offer.  
* **Negotiation Space:**  I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I have 9 more rounds, so I'm not in a rush to sell.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to go higher than $120 if I counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send a counteroffer that's higher than $120 but lower than my initial offer. 
* I'll carefully consider the tone and wording of my counteroffer to maintain a positive relationship with Bob while still trying to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. This reflects the value of the product, but I'm also trying to be fair to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm counteroffering at $135, which is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $150 and Bob's offer of $120. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by saying it ""reflects the value.""
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm using the word ""fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and hopefully encourage him to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer.
* If he rejects it, I'll need to consider my options:
    * Counteroffer again, potentially lowering the price slightly more.
    * Accept his offer of $120 if I'm satisfied with that price.
    * Sell to John for $100 if I'm not confident of securing a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible. $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $130.  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $130 is only $10 less than my minimum acceptable price of $140.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Bob emphasized fairness, and I'm willing to accept a price that feels fair to both of us.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal. I've managed to secure a price that's close to my minimum, and I've avoided the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
