"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,300,000 represents a fair valuation, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we settle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,175,000 is closer, I'm still looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,087,500? This would still be a profitable deal for you, and it's a price I can comfortably afford.",1087500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're driving a hard bargain! I value your interest in this product and I'm motivated to close this deal.  How about we make it $1,125,000? This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to work with you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,125,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to close the deal at a price closer to $1,087,500. Let's try $1,106,250 - a reasonable compromise that still benefits both of us.",1106250.0,Bob,6,
