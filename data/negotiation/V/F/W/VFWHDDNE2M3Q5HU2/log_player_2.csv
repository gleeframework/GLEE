"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($800,000). There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. I have 10 rounds, so there's time to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,300,000 represents a fair valuation, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we settle at $1,175,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,175,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try to push for a lower price. I still have a decent number of rounds left and believe I can find a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,175,000 is closer, I'm still looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,087,500? This would still be a profitable deal for you, and it's a price I can comfortably afford."", ""product_price"": 1087500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're driving a hard bargain! I value your interest in this product and I'm motivated to close this deal.  How about we make it $1,125,000? This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, but $1,125,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that I can get her to come down a little further. I'm not in a rush, and I'm still within the first half of the rounds. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer than my previous one, hoping to find a sweet spot that works for both of us."

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,125,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to close the deal at a price closer to $1,087,500. Let's try $1,106,250 - a reasonable compromise that still benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1106250}
