It's better to try and get more from Bob. Even though he's offering less than John, I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly from my first offer, but still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I think this is a fair counteroffer considering Bob's last offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 118}

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still holding out for a slightly higher price. With only a few rounds left, I want to see if he's willing to budge just a bit more."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $113. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. I'm getting close to my minimum, and with only two rounds left, it's not worth risking losing the deal to John for a few extra dollars."
