Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Since you have a guaranteed sale at your minimum, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. I propose a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's positive, acknowledges Bob's value perception, and suggests a mutually beneficial deal.
* **The Price:**  $1,350,000 leaves a good portion of the potential profit ($150,000) on the table for Bob, making it more likely he'll accept. You secure a $150,000 profit above your minimum.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You have room to negotiate down to $1,200,000 if needed.
* **Confidence:** Approach the negotiation with confidence.  You know your product's worth and have a backup plan."
