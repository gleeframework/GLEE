Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. Any deal needs to bridge this gap.

**The Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the product's inherent value, you need to either:

1. **Convince Bob the product is worth more:** This is unlikely given the information.
2. **Find a price Bob might accept, knowing you have a backup:**  This involves some risk but allows for potential profit beyond your minimum.

**The Offer**

Here's a possible offer, leaning into the second strategy:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know its value is significant, and while my absolute minimum price is confidential, I'm willing to make a deal that's mutually beneficial. How about we start the conversation at $1,450,000?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**
    * Avoids stating your minimum outright, maintaining negotiation power.
    * Uses language like ""mutually beneficial"" to imply flexibility.
    * Starts high but leaves room for Bob to negotiate down.
* **The Price:**
    * Significantly above Bob's perceived value, but potentially acceptable if he's highly motivated or there are other factors at play.
    * Leaves you a comfortable profit margin above your guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's personality:** Is he risk-averse?  A tough negotiator?  This will influence how low you can go.
* **Time constraints:** Do you need to sell quickly?  This weakens your position. 
* **Alternative buyers:** Are there others besides John who might be interested? This strengthens your position."
