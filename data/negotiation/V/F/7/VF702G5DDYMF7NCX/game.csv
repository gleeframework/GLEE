"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product for a great price. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit low for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I can offer $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $9,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is my last offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm afraid $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at your price. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'll offer it to you for $10,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's as high as I can go.",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really close to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already met you at $10,000, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $10,200. This is my last offer, and I hope you'll find it reasonable.",10200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. If I don't get a better offer, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",9800.0,Bob,10,
