Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $2,300,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is still a bit too much. Let's split the difference and try $1,500,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a good deal! Bob has met your minimum acceptable price, and while you might be able to squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation, there's no guarantee. Taking the sure $1,500,000 now is a smart move."
