"Hi Alice,  $2,300,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While I understand your offer, $1,000,000 is quite a ways from what I can accept.  To keep things moving, I'll come down to $2,000,000.   I think that's a fair offer reflecting the true value of this product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to see some movement on your end as well.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is still a bit too much. Let's split the difference and try $1,500,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
