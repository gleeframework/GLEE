"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your target price. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to make a reasonable profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is within my budget and a significant improvement on her initial offer.  It's still a bit higher than my ideal price, but it's a good compromise. Buying from John for $15,000 would be more expensive."
