{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than Bob's estimated value, giving him room to negotiate. However, it's also significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my desired price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
