"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is above my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I've started with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying within my budget.  My goal is to see how flexible Alice is on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $7,500. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but the price is still higher than what John offers. I'll try to negotiate a bit further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $6,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 6750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm incrementally increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price well below her current offer and closer to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $6,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I can offer it to you for $7,250. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but she's still above John's offer. I'll push a little further to see if I can get the price down to at least $7,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! How about $7,000 even? That's a solid offer and would allow us to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm aiming for a round number that's a significant step up from my last offer while still staying below Alice's last offer. This shows I'm serious about purchasing but also want a competitive price. It puts the ball in her court to either accept a price below her initial offer or hold firm, potentially risking the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting close to my target price! I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,100. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and the price difference is now relatively small. Accepting this offer saves me $900 compared to John's price and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing altogether."
