"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $7,500. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $6,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I can offer it to you for $7,250. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",7250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! How about $7,000 even? That's a solid offer and would allow us to close this deal.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting close to my target price! I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,100. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",7100.0,Alice,7,
