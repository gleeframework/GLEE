"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation. It also gauges Bob's eagerness and gives you valuable information about his perception of the product's worth. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" the offer hints at the product's worth beyond just a number, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's input, signaling your willingness to negotiate. 
 
This strategy attempts to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is significantly lower than our initial ask. While it's a substantial sum, we have room to negotiate and aim for a better deal.  We'll use the next round to counter with a figure closer to our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 falls short of the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Stand Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but signal that it's still too low by stating it ""falls short.""
* **Strategic Price Drop:**  The counteroffer of $1,050,000 shows flexibility while still maintaining a strong position. It's a $50,000 decrease from our initial ask, but a significant $100,000 increase from Bob's offer.
* **Reiterate Value:**  We emphasize the product's value again, subtly anchoring Bob's perception to a higher price point.
* **Solution-Oriented:** Framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to see it positively and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows for a smooth transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a strong price, meeting us exactly in the middle of our previous positions.  Here's why it makes sense to accept:

* **Excellent Profit:** $1,000,000 is a $200,000 profit margin, significantly exceeding our minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Negotiation by Bob:** Bob has consistently negotiated well, and further pushing him risks souring the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate capital and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds. 

While there's a chance we could squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation, the risk of losing the deal and settling for John's $800,000 offer is too significant. Accepting $1,000,000 secures a great outcome."
