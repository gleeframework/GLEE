"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 falls short of the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows for a smooth transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
