"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives you a solid margin for profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring if you can get a better price.  Since you have 10 rounds, it's worth risking a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process and sets a clear starting point.  It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within a reasonable range given the product's value to both of you. This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromises in the coming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000?  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to meet my needs. Let's make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget.  While John is offering the product for $1,000,000, there's still an opportunity to negotiate a better price with Alice.  There are 7 rounds left, and I can likely get a lower price by rejecting and counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strong move. It's a clear indication that you're serious about getting the product, but you're not willing to go above your budget. It also presents a win-win scenario: Alice gets her desired price, and you get the product at your limit. This offer is likely to be accepted, but if Alice rejects it, you're still in a good position to close the deal with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. The product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth more to you in the long run.  How about we settle on $1,025,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $1,025,000, it's still above my maximum budget. We've gone through several rounds, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to go lower.  John is offering the product at my exact limit, and I'd rather secure the product and avoid any further negotiation. There are only 5 rounds left, and the risk of not closing the deal with Alice is too high."
