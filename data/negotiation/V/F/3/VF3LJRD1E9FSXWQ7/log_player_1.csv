Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  $950,000 is too far below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000?  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to meet my needs. Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting because it's at his maximum value,  I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. The product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth more to you in the long run.  How about we settle on $1,025,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
