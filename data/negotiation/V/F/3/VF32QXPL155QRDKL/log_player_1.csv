{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than Bob's perceived value:**  It gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Is lower than your minimum:** This leaves you room to potentially make concessions if needed.
* **Is a reasonable price:** It's not too far off from your minimum, and it's a number that's easy to negotiate from. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your earnings, but also to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. We'll see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $100 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $60 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's significantly lower than my minimum and leaves little room for negotiation.  I'd prefer to try and get closer to my desired price.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum.  I'll need to be careful though, as I don't want to risk losing him completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $60 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $80? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $80. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Still above my minimum:** This keeps me in a good position to earn a decent profit.
* **Positive tone:** I'm trying to keep the conversation friendly and avoid a breakdown in negotiations. 

I believe this counteroffer is a good balance between getting a good price and maintaining a positive relationship with Bob. We'll see how he reacts!"
