"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Friendly approach:** A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $110 is higher than Bob's valuation, it's not too far off that he'll immediately reject the offer. This allows for a back and forth conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as an option provides a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's midway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise and encourages a deal.
* **Focus on fairness:** Highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price makes it more appealing to Bob and makes the negotiation seem like a win-win situation.
* **Positive message:** The message remains friendly and optimistic, fostering a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference at $90?  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **John is a secure option:**  John's offer is a guaranteed $100, which is still preferable to accepting Bob's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is still a little too low for me. How about we compromise at $92.50? That's closer to what I need, and it's still a great price for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise while still remaining close to my desired price.
* **Emphasize good deal:** I highlight the ""great price"" for Bob, making it more appealing to him. 
* **Clear counteroffer:** I explicitly state the new price, making it clear what I'm offering.
* **Maintain friendly tone:** The message remains positive and friendly to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $92.50 is still a bit more than I want to spend.  I'm sticking with my last offer of $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **No significant progress:** Bob's offer hasn't moved much from his initial counteroffer. 
* **John is a secure option:** Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is more than Bob is currently offering and meets my minimum price.

It's better to secure the guaranteed sale to John rather than risk continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price or no sale at all."
