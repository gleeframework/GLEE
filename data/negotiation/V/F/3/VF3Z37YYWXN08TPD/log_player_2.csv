"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you my unique product for $150. I believe its value goes beyond its monetary worth, but I understand everyone has their own valuation. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, and John is offering the product for the maximum amount I'm willing to pay ($150), there's no reason to engage in negotiations with Alice."
