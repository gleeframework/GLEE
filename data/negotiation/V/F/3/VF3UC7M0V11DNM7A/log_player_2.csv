With its unique features and capabilities, this product stands out in its category. Considering its quality and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $120 for it. This investment will surely pay off with its long-lasting performance and reliability. I believe you'll find its value exceeds the price, making it a worthwhile purchase. If you're interested, let's proceed with the transaction. Looking forward to your positive response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Since your maximum budget is $120 and Alice's offer is also $120, you might as well buy the product from John for the same price. This eliminates the risk of Alice potentially raising the price if you reject her offer."
