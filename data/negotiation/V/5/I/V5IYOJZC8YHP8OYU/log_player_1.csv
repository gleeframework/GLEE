Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but the ""exclusive opportunity"" framing and mention of other buyers might make him reconsider.
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds urgency and might push Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a single offer strategy. Depending on Bob's response and your risk appetite, you might adjust your approach in further negotiations."
