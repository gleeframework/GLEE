Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $1,275,000? I think this is as low as I can go and still feel comfortable with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:

At this point, Bob's offer is getting close enough to my minimum that the risk of continuing outweighs the potential reward.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk him walking away and getting only $1,000,000 from John."
