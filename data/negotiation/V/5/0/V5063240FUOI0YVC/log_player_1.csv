Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $135 is more than your minimum of $150, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below John's offer:**  This keeps you open to a potential deal with Bob while still having John as a safety net.
* **It's a reasonable price:** $135 is halfway between your value and Bob's value, so it's a fair starting point.

By offering a slightly lower price than you'd like, you open the door for Bob to potentially accept your offer or counter with a higher price, giving you more leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $150. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $125 is tempting, I'm really hoping to get closer to $130 for this product.  It's truly special and I believe it will be well worth the investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's closer to Bob's offer:** Showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:** Ensuring you get a price you're comfortable with.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** You can still go slightly lower if needed, but you've set a firmer stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $130. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $127.5 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your target and you've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation. At this point, it's more beneficial to sell the product to John for $150.  It ensures you meet your minimum price and avoids further haggling with Bob."
