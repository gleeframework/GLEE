"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,450,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. $1,450,000 is too high, and we can likely get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings to your specific needs is substantial.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

We're still a bit too high.  Let's try to push a bit more."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay at this stage.  I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
