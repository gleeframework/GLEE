"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is already showing some flexibility by going above his initial valuation. While I could push for more, accepting his offer isn't a terrible outcome.
