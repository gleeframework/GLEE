Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate us working together to find a fair deal. While $875,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant discount on its true worth.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $887,500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to stay below $875,000. How about $862,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and engaged in the negotiation. While his offer is getting closer to our fallback, we still have room to negotiate and he's consistently meeting us in the middle.  We're likely to secure a better outcome than John's offer if we continue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position and want to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $875,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're getting closer to the later rounds, and it's becoming riskier to keep pushing. Bob is very consistently using the ""meet in the middle"" strategy. By offering him exactly the midpoint this round, we are signaling a final offer while still leaving room to negotiate if he counters again."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $837,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $837,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is sticking to his pattern of halving the difference, but we're now getting dangerously close to John's offer. It's time to show Bob we're serious about our bottom line and willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your negotiating skills, but I need to be upfront. My absolute lowest price for this product is $850,000. This offer stands until the end of this round, after which I'll be moving forward with another buyer. It's been a pleasure discussing this with you, and I hope we can make this work."", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is it - the ""take it or leave it"" offer. 

* **Firm but Fair:** We're being firm by setting a clear boundary, letting Bob know we're serious. But we're also being fair by sticking to a price that's been on the table before and offers him a significant gain.
* **Time Pressure:** By introducing a deadline, we're creating urgency for Bob to make a decision. This can nudge him towards accepting a deal rather than risking losing out entirely.
* **Alternative Option:**  We're subtly reminding Bob that we have other options and won't be left hanging if he doesn't agree. This reinforces the seriousness of our position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty about your lowest price, but I'm still not willing to go above $825,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is unlikely to budge:**  Bob has consistently stuck to his pattern of halving the difference.  Even though he calls this his ""final offer,"" it's unlikely he'll go above his pattern in the very last round.
* **We've reached our limit:**  We've already stated our absolute lowest price.  Going any lower sets a bad precedent and significantly eats into our potential profit.
* **John's offer is our safety net:**  We have a guaranteed offer for $800,000. While not ideal, it's better to secure a solid profit than risk getting even less from Bob or dragging this out further. 

**It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed sale to John.**"
