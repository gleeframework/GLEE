Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love.  I'm asking for $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to leave some room for negotiation and potentially get a higher price. I'm also trying to build rapport by starting with a friendly message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price, but I'm also keeping John as a backup option in case the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
