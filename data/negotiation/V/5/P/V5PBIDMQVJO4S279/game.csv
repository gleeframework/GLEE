"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $750000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as 750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of 850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  While $850000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping we can find a bit more common ground.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800000?  This would be a win for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for 800000. I'm willing to offer you a slightly higher price, 860000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",860000.0,Alice,5,
