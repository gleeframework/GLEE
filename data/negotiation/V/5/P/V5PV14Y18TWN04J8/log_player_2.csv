Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to accept $75 yet, Bob. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $80, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to pay that, I'll sell it to you.

This is Alice's final offer and it matches her value for the product.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower. Accepting at $80 secures the product for less than John's offer."
