"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Can we meet in the middle?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a different price in mind. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1800000 is still below the value of this product. How about we split the difference and go with $1900000? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward quickly.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above $1900000. How about we try $1700000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from there.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  However, $1700000 is still significantly below the value I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $1850000. This gives us a fair price, and we can finalize the transaction quickly.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1850000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1800000, which is the midpoint between our last offers. How about we try $1825000?",1825000.0,Bob,6,
