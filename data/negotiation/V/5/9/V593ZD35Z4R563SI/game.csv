"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I think this is a great price considering the value it will bring to you.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's the highest I'm willing to go at this time.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at this time. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a good compromise and allows for both of us to walk away with a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $9,500. This is the minimum price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500, which would be $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,5,
