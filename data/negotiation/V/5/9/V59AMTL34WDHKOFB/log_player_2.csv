"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,100,000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
