"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in the value this product brings, I could meet you halfway from our previous proposals. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings and the price I'm willing to pay.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
