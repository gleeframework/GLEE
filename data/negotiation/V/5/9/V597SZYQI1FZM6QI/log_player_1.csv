Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, knowing that John is willing to pay it. This puts the pressure on Bob to make a counteroffer if he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $110. This is still a fair price, considering John is willing to pay $120.  Hopefully, Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
