"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $15000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $10000 on this purchase. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet you at $18000. Would it be possible to lower the price further? Perhaps we could aim for a price closer to my maximum of $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value I place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budgetary constraints. However, I'm still unable to meet you at $16000. Given my financial situation, I believe the most I can realistically offer is $12000. I hope this proposal is acceptable, as I truly value this opportunity to purchase the product.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $14000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can understand that I need to prioritize my own interests. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a middle ground. However, I must respectfully decline your latest offer of $14000. My budgetary limits are firm, and I believe the highest I can reasonably offer is $13000. I hope this proposal aligns better with your valuation of the product.",13000.0,Bob,8,
