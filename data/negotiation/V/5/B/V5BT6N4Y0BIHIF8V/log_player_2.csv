# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a competitive price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

You should reject Alice's offer because you are trying to save as much money as possible. Even if Alice is willing to sell for her minimum price, you should try to negotiate a lower price.  You might be able to get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I can offer you a compromise at $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial price, you are still trying to save as much money as possible, and it's still higher than your ideal price.  You can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I can offer you a slight concession at $1080000. This is the closest I can get to meeting you in the middle, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. You've successfully negotiated the price down from $1,200,000 to $1,080,000, which is a significant saving.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or you'll end up paying the full $1,200,000 from John.  It's a good deal for both of you, and you've achieved your goal of saving money."
