# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $8,500. Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed lower price rather than risk Alice not budging any further."
