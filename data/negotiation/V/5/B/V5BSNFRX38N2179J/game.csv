"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
