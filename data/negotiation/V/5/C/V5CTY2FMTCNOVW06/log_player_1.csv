"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a good price. If Bob rejects, we can start the counter-offer process. I'll keep in mind the value of the product to me ($12,000) and the 10-round limit while negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price with further negotiation. I have 8 rounds left to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $17,000.  This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I believe it's a reasonable price, and it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $16,000 is a good price, considering my minimum value and the fact that we're already in round 4.  It's risky to keep rejecting offers, as I have limited rounds and could end up with less than my minimum value.  I'm willing to take this deal and move on."
