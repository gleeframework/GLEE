"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $825,000. This price is fair and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's finalize this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
