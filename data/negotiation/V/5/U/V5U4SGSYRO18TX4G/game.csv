"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $80 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  While I agree it's a good product, $130 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $100? That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
