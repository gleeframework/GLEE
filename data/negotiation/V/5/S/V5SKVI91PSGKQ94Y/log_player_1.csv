Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I've assessed it at and the potential benefits it will bring to my business.  Let's start with this and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 undervalues the product significantly. It's a unique offering with the potential to transform your operations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a strong offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair balance between the product's potential and the cost I'm willing to invest.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely we'll bridge the gap quickly enough to make it worth passing on John's offer.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
