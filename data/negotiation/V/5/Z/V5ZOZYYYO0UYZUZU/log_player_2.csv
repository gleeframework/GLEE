Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my budget and John's offer. It's best to negotiate for a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget, but $70 is quite low for the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $120?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still too far from my ideal price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."
