Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $130, which is above my minimum of $100 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** My message is friendly and focuses on the value the product offers Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  While $120 is lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum of $100. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point.
* **Strategic rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This will incentivize him to come up with a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  It's a fair price that's good for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is reasonable:** $125 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still being closer to my preferred price point. 
* **Positive and persuasive message:** I use phrases like ""fair price"" and ""good for both of us"" to frame the counter-offer positively and make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Focus on a win-win:** The message emphasizes that the counter-offer is beneficial for both parties, enhancing the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $125. Would you be willing to meet me at $122? That's the highest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** $122 is just $3 away from my initial offer of $125.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'm accepting this offer, I'm also keeping in mind that I could potentially make a final counter-offer if Bob shows willingness to negotiate further in future rounds.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a higher price.

Considering the factors above, accepting Bob's offer at $122 seems like the best decision, as it's a good price and avoids the risk of potentially getting a lower price from John."
