"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure.  To be frank,  $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
