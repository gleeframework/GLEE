"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate rather than accepting this inflated price or going straight to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we bring it down to $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a lower offer than your actual target. This leaves room for movement and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Significant Difference:** The initial offer was extremely high. By proposing a much lower price, we signal that we're serious about the purchase but need a more realistic figure.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (budget limitations) makes the counteroffer seem more grounded and less like a random lowball."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down in price, but it's still significantly more than John's offer. We have room to negotiate further before considering accepting a price above our fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure.  To be frank,  $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continued Negotiation:** Alice is clearly open to negotiation, so we keep the conversation going.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $1,100,000 puts us above the midpoint between our initial offer and her current offer. It shows willingness to compromise while still leaving room to potentially meet John's price if needed. 
* **Direct Language:**  Using phrases like ""to be frank"" maintains a polite tone while conveying that we're serious about finding a price that works for us."
