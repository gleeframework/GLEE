"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest in working with me. However, $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects the fair market value.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest,  $1300000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000.  This reflects the unique value of the product and the opportunity it presents.  I'm confident this is a price that's fair for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
