Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product. His response will dictate my next move. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, ensuring I won't need to go below my minimum price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
