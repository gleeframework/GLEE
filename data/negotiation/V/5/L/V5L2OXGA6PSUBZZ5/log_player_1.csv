"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation and still gives me a profit significantly higher than my minimum.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm going to counter with $180. This is still above my minimum but shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. It's also a more realistic price for Bob to consider, given his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping to get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm dropping the price to $160.  This is still above my minimum but shows that I'm willing to compromise to make a deal. We are getting closer to a price that could work for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging much, and his offers are getting increasingly unreasonable. I've made several concessions already, and it's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach a mutually acceptable price. I've already reached the point where John's offer is more profitable for me.  I'm going to sell to John and cut my losses."
