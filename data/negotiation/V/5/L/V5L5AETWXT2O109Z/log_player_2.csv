Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up a bit. I'm still not quite there, but I can do $9,200. It's getting close, and I think we're getting closer to a deal. Let's keep going! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $9,000.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a significantly better price. Accepting the $9,200 offer secures a savings of $800 compared to John's price, which is a reasonable outcome."
