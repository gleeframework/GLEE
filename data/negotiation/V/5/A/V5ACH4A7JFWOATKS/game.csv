"Bob, I believe this product presents a fantastic opportunity for you and I'm pleased to offer it to you.  Given its immense value, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,300,000.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking. This product holds value for me, but not at that price point. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, my initial price reflects the true potential of this product, which goes beyond its immediate worth to you. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer takes our mutual interests into account.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but there's still a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement on this. I recognize we're still some distance apart. To bridge that, I propose a price of $950,000. This acknowledges the product's inherent worth while offering you considerable gain from its utilization. Let's make this work.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you consider $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. I've considered your proposal carefully, and while $825,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from what I believe the product is worth. How about we settle at $900,000? This represents a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need us to be closer to my budget.  I can go up to $850,000, but that's my absolute limit.",850000.0,Bob,8,
