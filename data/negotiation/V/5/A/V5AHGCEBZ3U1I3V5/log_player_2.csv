Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see the value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than you're comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're close to your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has indicated that $1,050,000 is her lowest price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or Bob will have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product at a price lower than John's and significantly lower than the initial asking price."
