Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you're in a strong position to aim higher with Bob.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a higher offer ($1,500,000) sets an anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to your desired outcome than if you started lower.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's ""value and potential"" and the ""significant return on investment,"" you're framing the higher price as justified rather than arbitrary. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiation style:** The success of this approach depends partly on Bob's personality. If he's known to walk away from seemingly high offers, a more moderate starting price might be wiser. 
* **Relationship building:**  This initial offer is just the beginning of a potential negotiation. Aim to establish a collaborative tone while staying firm on the product's value."
