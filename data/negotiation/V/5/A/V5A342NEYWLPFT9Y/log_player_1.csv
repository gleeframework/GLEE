Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is better than nothing, I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000.  I'll see if I can get a higher counteroffer from Bob in the next round."
