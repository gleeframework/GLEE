"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, hoping to get him to come up a bit.  It's important to remember that I can always go to John for the full $15,000 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not going to accept it yet.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I can still go to John for the full $15,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but $12,800 is still too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can meet in the middle.  I'm also starting to feel a bit more confident that I can get a better price from Bob, so I'm less inclined to sell to John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I think we're getting closer. How about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I really want to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $13,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $12,900 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough one. While I'd prefer to get closer to $13,000, Bob is almost at my minimum acceptable price.  If he rejects my offer in the next round, there's no guarantee he'll come up further, and I risk losing out on a good deal.  At this point, it's better to take the $12,900 and secure the sale."
