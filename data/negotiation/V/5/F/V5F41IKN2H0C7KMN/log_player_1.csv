Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, giving you a good profit margin.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000), giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still some space for Bob to counteroffer, which keeps the negotiation alive. 

By starting with a firm but reasonable offer, you increase your chances of reaching a deal that is favorable to both of you."
