# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $14,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product will bring to your business.
