"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose an alternative. Would you consider selling the product to me for $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit above that price point.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,375,000?  This would give you a good deal, and it's still a profitable transaction for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I must adhere to my budgetary constraints. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,360,000. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.",1360000.0,Bob,4,
