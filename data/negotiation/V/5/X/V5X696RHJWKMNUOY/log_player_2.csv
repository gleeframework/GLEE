"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get a better price than $900,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further.  The worst that can happen is she rejects your offer, and you can then choose to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price is a common negotiation tactic.  It establishes your willingness to negotiate and sets a lower starting point for further discussions.  The price of $700,000 is a significant reduction from $900,000, but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still a considerable amount of money. It's worth continuing to negotiate and trying to drive the price down further. If Alice rejects the next counteroffer, you can still buy from John for $1,500,000, so there's no risk in continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a compromise.  It's higher than your previous offer, showing you're willing to move closer to Alice's price, but still below her latest offer. This can encourage Alice to feel like a deal is within reach. If she rejects, you're still in a good position to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer of $900,000.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice could walk away, and you'd be stuck buying from John at a much higher price.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer secures a decent price, saving you $675,000 compared to buying from John."
