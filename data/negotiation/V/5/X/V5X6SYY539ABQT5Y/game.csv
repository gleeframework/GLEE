"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $14,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $12,000.  I think this is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I think this price is a fair compromise. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further in price, but $13,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to you and my maximum budget.  Let's make this deal work.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $13,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering it to you for $13,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I hope this compromise works for you.",13250.0,Alice,7,
