Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $80 is too low for me.  Could you do $130?

Round 4

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $110 is my final offer, otherwise, I'll need to sell it to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's price is getting closer to your budget, her mention of John and her ""final offer"" suggest she's getting close to her lower limit.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $100."
