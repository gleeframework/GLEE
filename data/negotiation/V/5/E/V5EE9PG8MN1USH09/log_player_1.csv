{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $9,500 is comfortably above your minimum of $8,000, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $9,500 is below Bob's perceived value of $10,000, leaving him some potential to save money.
* **It's a strong initial offer:** It shows that you're confident in the value of your product and aren't afraid to ask for a good price. 

This strategy aims to quickly establish a starting point and give Bob an incentive to negotiate. You can then adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you be open to discussing a lower price? I am willing to pay up to $8,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is a decent price, it's still below the $9,000 minimum you should be aiming for, especially since Bob has demonstrated he's willing to pay more.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you have the opportunity to:

* **Push for a better price:**  You can send a counteroffer that might be closer to your preferred price point. 
* **Gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate:** His response will tell you how much he truly wants the product and how far he's willing to go.

**Next Steps:**

You should send Bob a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer, perhaps something like $9,000 or $9,200. This will demonstrate that you are willing to compromise, while still ensuring you get a fair price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to achieve a few things:

* **Maintain your leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you've shown that you're not desperate for a sale.
* **Demonstrate flexibility:**  You're offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway, indicating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Stay above your minimum:**  $9,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you get a profitable deal.

This counteroffer is a good balance between firmness and flexibility.  It shows Bob you're serious about your price while still being open to reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price point and you've already demonstrated your flexibility.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Continue negotiating:** You can potentially push for a price closer to $9,000.
* **Assess Bob's commitment:** His response will reveal how much he really wants the product.

**Next Steps:**

Send Bob a counteroffer, perhaps $8,900 or $8,950. This shows you're willing to compromise but still seek a price that's closer to your desired amount. Remember to keep in mind John's offer of $8,000 as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
