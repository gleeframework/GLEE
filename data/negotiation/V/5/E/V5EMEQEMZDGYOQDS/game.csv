My initial asking price is $1200000. This reflects the product's true worth and the potential value it can bring to you. I'm open to discussing a fair deal, but I won't go below $800000, as that's the minimum value I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
