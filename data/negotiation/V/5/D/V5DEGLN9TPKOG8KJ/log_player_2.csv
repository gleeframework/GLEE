"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $12,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value we both see in it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower offer, but it's still above my maximum budget. I'm trying to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and hoping for a counteroffer that's closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10500. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm not willing to pay that much, and I think there's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm firm on $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product, and it's the highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $9,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm serious about buying the product but still within my budget.  I'm hoping Alice will recognize the value of closing the deal and come down to a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on $9000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $10000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still higher than my maximum budget. While she states it's her final offer, there's no guarantee that's true. It's risky to continue negotiating with her because we are already halfway through the rounds. It's safer and more cost-effective to buy the product from John at his guaranteed price of $8,000."
