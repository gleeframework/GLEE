"Thank you for the offer, Alice. $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product but can only offer $8000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $10000. How about we compromise at $11000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,,
