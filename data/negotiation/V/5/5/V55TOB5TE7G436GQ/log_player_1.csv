"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15,000. It's a steal considering its value! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than John's offer, I still believe the product is worth more. I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it holds. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate. Accepting his offer of $13,000 is a good compromise and ensures a sale without risking losing him as a buyer.  This is a solid deal that's significantly better than selling to John."
