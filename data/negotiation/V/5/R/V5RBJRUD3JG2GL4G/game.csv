"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Given my budget and the market value of this product, I can offer you $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price, reflecting both the product's worth and my ability to purchase it.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,300,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my end and keeps it within a reasonable range.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still slightly over my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
