,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get at least $1,250,000 for this product. It's still a great deal for you, considering its value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. $1,250,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there. How about $1,150,000? I believe this price is fair, considering the value to me and your need to make a profit.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm willing to continue negotiating with you. However, $1,150,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of the product. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $1,200,000 is my absolute bottom line. Let's close this deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
