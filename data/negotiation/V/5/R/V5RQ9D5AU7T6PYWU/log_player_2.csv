# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his maximum budget and there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get at least $1,250,000 for this product. It's still a great deal for you, considering its value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his maximum budget, there's still room to negotiate a better price. He can likely get it for closer to his desired price of $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. $1,250,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there. How about $1,150,000? I believe this price is fair, considering the value to me and your need to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm willing to continue negotiating with you. However, $1,150,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of the product. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $1,200,000 is my absolute bottom line. Let's close this deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's reached his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While he might be able to get a slightly better price with more rounds, there's no guarantee. Accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product at his maximum budget and avoids any potential delays or risks of the negotiation falling apart."
