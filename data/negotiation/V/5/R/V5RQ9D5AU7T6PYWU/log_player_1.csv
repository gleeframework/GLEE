"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get at least $1,250,000 for this product. It's still a great deal for you, considering its value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. $1,250,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there. How about $1,150,000? I believe this price is fair, considering the value to me and your need to make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm willing to continue negotiating with you. However, $1,150,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of the product. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $1,200,000 is my absolute bottom line. Let's close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
