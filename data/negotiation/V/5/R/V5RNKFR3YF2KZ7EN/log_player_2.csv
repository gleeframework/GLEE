"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $950000.  This represents a significant value to you, as you've indicated it's worth $1000000. I believe this price is fair for both of us. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to pay $800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** You can save $50,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **There's no guarantee you'll get a better deal:** You don't know if John is willing to negotiate, and you risk losing the product altogether if you reject Alice's offer and John changes his mind."
