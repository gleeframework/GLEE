"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.

Bob should continue to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a good price, he can likely get it lower."

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He has gotten the price down to $825,000, which is a significant saving from the original $1,200,000.  While he could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get it lower.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
