"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than John's offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $9,000 is a bit more than I'd hoped to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  That feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he's going for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $8,500 is a good compromise, as it's still higher than Alice's minimum but leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone will hopefully encourage Alice to consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice has come down from her original price, and $8,800 is a fair compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price and closer to Bob's target.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might save a small amount, but there's a risk of Alice walking away or the price going back up.
* **Time is Valuable:** It's important for Bob to weigh the value of his time against the potential savings. Accepting this offer is a good way to secure the product at a decent price without risking further delays."
