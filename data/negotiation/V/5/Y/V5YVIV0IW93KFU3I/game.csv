"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This would be a great price for you, and still allows me to get a fair deal.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,250, which is a fair compromise. This price allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,5,
