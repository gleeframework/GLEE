{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This would be a great price for you, and still allows me to get a fair deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might walk away or I might not be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds.  I'll accept his offer and secure a sale."
