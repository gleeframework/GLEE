This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You're getting a good deal:** $10,150 is significantly less than John's offer of $12,000 and a decent savings from Alice's initial offer.
* **Limited rounds:** You're running out of rounds, and while you could try to push Alice further, there's no guarantee she'll go lower. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject this offer, you risk Alice accepting your previous offer at $10,000 in a later round, or you might be forced to buy from John at the higher price. 

It's a judgment call, but accepting at $10,150 secures a good price and avoids the risk of ending up with a worse outcome."
