"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is too low for me. Would you consider $11,000?  That's a fair compromise, I believe.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While I understand your position, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution at this price.",10750.0,Bob,4,
