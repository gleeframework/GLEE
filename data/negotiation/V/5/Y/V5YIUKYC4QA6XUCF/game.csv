"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $800000 is significantly below my asking price, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1400000?  This would still allow me to achieve a reasonable profit while offering you a fair price for the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your target. How about we meet at $1100000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1100000 is closer to my bottom line, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price reflects the unique value of the product and ensures both of us have a successful transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
