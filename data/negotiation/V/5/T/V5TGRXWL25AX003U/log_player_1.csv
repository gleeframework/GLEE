Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be extremely valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $10,000, Bob values it at $15,000.  This presents an opportunity to make a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product for $14,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (saving $1,000) while maximizing your potential profit.  
* **First Right of Refusal:** By phrasing it as an exclusive offer, it might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the deal."
