"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $15,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It's time to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider something closer to $6,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's important to start with a counteroffer that gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate. If she outright rejects it, you'll know you need to increase your offer substantially or consider John's offer. 
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:**  The message maintains a polite tone and keeps the door open for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above your maximum and John's offer. There's room to negotiate further before resorting to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Fair:** This counteroffer directly proposes your maximum price while framing it as a compromise and a fair deal.
* **Testing the Waters:**  By offering your maximum, you're seeing if Alice is truly willing to negotiate within your price range. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You still have the option of going with John's offer if Alice rejects this counteroffer."
