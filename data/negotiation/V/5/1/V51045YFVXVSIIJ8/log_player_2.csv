"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I believe it's incredibly valuable, so I'm starting the price at $170. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for getting back to me, Alice. While I understand the value, $125 is still a bit higher than what I'm looking to spend. Could you do $95?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.  How about $115? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and she's unlikely to go much lower than $115.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation, potentially missing out on the product altogether. Buying from John guarantees the product at the desired price point."
