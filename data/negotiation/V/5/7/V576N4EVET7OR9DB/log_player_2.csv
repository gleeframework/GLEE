"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for the lowest price possible, ideally under $80. Alice's initial offer of $110 is too high, so Bob should reject it. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $100 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. Bob is aiming for a price under $80, so he should reject Alice's offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get the product for closer to $80. How about we split the difference and go with $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down to $95, it's still above Bob's target price of $80. Bob can afford to reject this offer and continue negotiating. He might be able to get Alice to lower the price even further, or he can always choose to buy from John if the price doesn't get any lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $92. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $97.50. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $97.50 is still above Bob's target price of $80. Even though Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge any further.  Given that there are only a few rounds left, it's a better strategy for Bob to buy the product from John for $80. This ensures he gets the product at his desired price and avoids the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice."
