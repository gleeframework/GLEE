Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $900,000. This gives Bob a good deal since the product is worth $800,000 to him, and it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a higher price than John's offer, but I'm also willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

I'm offering $875,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can push for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to $850,000, but still above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 840000}
``` 

I'm offering $840,000. This is a small increase from Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While I would like to get more, the negotiations with Bob are becoming unproductive, and I'm not confident I can get a significantly better price from him.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing that by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
