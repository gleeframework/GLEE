Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,000,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, as it's worth that much to me.  I believe Bob might be willing to pay a bit more to secure the product, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I also have a backup offer from John for $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to sell it to Bob at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate, but it still leaves me with a profit. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my desired price. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate. I'm happy with John's offer, so I'll choose to sell the product to him for $1,000,000."
