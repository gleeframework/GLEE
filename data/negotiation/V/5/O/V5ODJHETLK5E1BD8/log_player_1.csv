Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account the information given:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm looking for a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** Your minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Setting the price at $1,350,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product while leaving you with a substantial profit above your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters.  
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price for strategic reasons. However, maximizing immediate profit is the primary goal in this scenario."
