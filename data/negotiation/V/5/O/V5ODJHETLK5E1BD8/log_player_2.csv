"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm looking for a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a guaranteed fallback option with John at $1,500,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price slightly to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting her initial offer, you create an opportunity for a better deal without risking exceeding your budget."
