Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a price that is still significantly higher than the product's worth to him, but leaves some room for negotiation. I am confident I can get at least $12,000 from John if Bob rejects my offer, so I am willing to compromise slightly to see if we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm confident I can get a higher price from John, so I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,750. This is a slight increase from his offer, but still significantly lower than my desired price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go lower than $12,000.  John is willing to pay that amount, so it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
