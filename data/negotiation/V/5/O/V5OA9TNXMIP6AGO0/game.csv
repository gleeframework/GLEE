"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand that $6,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer.  However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $9,000 is closer, I can't quite meet that. How about $7,000? That's the highest I can go.",7000.0,Bob,4,
