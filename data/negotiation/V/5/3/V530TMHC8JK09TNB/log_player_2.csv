"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm looking for a price of $10,000 to make this a worthwhile deal for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford right now.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is too low for me to consider. This product is worth a significant amount to the right buyer. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his ideal price, it's still higher than his limit. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $9,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,250, which is a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further back-and-forth."", ""product_price"": 8250}
