"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, reflecting its value to both of us. This price would still give you a healthy profit margin, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.  Let's see if we can agree on this figure.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,075,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference between our last two offers. I'll go up to $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both of our positions, and I believe it will allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?",1012500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I meet my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to meet your minimum, but $1,100,000 is still a significant stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise for both of us. It would allow you to achieve a strong profit margin, and it would save me a considerable amount of money.  Let's close this deal now.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering $1,075,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 3. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finally agree on this figure.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. We've been going back and forth, and I'm starting to think we might be too far apart. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll go up to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a decent outcome.  I'm confident we can close this deal now at this price. If you're not willing to accept, I'll need to consider my other options.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet on this, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a deal. I'm counteroffering $1,050,000, which is the same price you offered in Round 6. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finally agree on this figure. If not, I'll need to consider my other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
