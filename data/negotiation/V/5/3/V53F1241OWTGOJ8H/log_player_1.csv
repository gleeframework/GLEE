Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, reflecting its value to both of us. This price would still give you a healthy profit margin, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.  Let's see if we can agree on this figure.
