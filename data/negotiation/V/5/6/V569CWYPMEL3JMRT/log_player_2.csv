"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds remaining, so Bob has time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within his budget. He aims to make a bold move, demonstrating his seriousness about buying the product while establishing his desired price range. This could potentially push Alice to consider a lower price in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. Can we discuss a price in that range? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $14,000 is still above Bob's budget.  He's better off continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further. There's still time to secure a better deal before having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000. If that doesn't work, I might have to look elsewhere for this product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with his previous offer, hoping to show Alice that he is serious about that price point. He is also subtly reminding her that he has the option to buy from John. This pressure might push Alice towards a compromise in the next round."
