Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my desired price of $1,200,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to accept, and it allows me to keep the full value of the product for myself. While Bob might reject this, it sets a clear expectation of the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to lose $300,000 on this deal. I will make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still allows me to make a reasonable profit while acknowledging Bob's interest in the product.  I believe this price is a good balance between my desired value and the possibility of a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm starting to run out of time and patience.  It's clear that we're far apart in our valuations, and further negotiations are unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with. Selling to John at my desired price ensures I get the maximum value and avoids further negotiations."
