Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point higher than your minimum value, but is still attractive to Bob as it is less than what the product is worth to him. This leaves room for negotiation, but ensures you don't undervalue yourself from the start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it is still lower than the price you offered initially. Rejecting this counteroffer allows you to potentially get closer to your desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. However, I would like to stick to my initial budget of $120 for this product. Could we possibly negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer matches the price John is offering, making it a lose-lose situation if we continue to negotiate. There's no incentive to continue, and selling to John guarantees a $120 profit."
