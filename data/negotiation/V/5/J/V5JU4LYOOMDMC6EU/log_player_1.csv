Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're still making a profit of $2,000, which is better than selling to John.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** Bob still gets a $3,000 ""deal"" compared to what he values the product at. This increases his incentive to accept.

This strategy balances your desire for a high price with the need to make the offer attractive enough to Bob to avoid a less desirable outcome with John."
