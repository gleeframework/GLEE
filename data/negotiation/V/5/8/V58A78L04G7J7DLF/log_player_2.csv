"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's always worth trying to negotiate, as you might be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price, hoping to establish a lower baseline for negotiations. This also gives Alice some room to bargain without immediately rejecting my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget. I'm not willing to pay more than $1,200,000.  While there is a chance I could get a better price from Alice, it's a risk, and I'm not sure how low she is willing to go. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise, but if it doesn't work, I'll be ready to purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise.  $1,150,000 is still below my maximum budget and potentially a fair price considering Alice's last offer. If Alice rejects this counteroffer, I'll be ready to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Although we've been close in our negotiations, I'm not confident that I can convince Alice to go lower.  It's better to cut my losses and purchase the product from John at my maximum price."
