"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is the minimum I can accept.  This price still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
