"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a special price of $11,500. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own this valuable item, and I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is below your maximum budget, you can do better. Rejecting her offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her $10,000 valuation. You can always fall back on buying from John for $12,000."
