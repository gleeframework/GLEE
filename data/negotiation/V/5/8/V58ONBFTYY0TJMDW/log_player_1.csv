Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get as much as possible.
* **Reasonable margin:** $140 is still within my minimum acceptable price of $150, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** A friendly message can encourage Bob to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Potential for a better offer:** By rejecting, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price, which might encourage him to raise his counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to go down to $135. This is still a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go at this point. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain a profit margin:** $135 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Positive and encouraging message:**  I'm being polite and encouraging Bob to consider my offer, hoping to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum acceptable price:** Bob's offer of $125 falls below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **No further negotiation:**  I've already made a concession in the previous round, and further negotiation is unlikely to get me closer to my desired price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is my minimum goal. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit with John than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
