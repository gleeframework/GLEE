Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  What do you think?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counter with a price that's more reasonable for both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  $1,300,000 is my best price right now.  This is still a fantastic deal for you, as you know the product is worth significantly more to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,275,000. This is a great deal for you, and allows us to come to an agreement.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
