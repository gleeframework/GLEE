"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me considering the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a more substantial offer. How about $1,250,000? This leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still aiming to keep the price at $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget.  Let's aim to reach a mutually agreeable solution.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
