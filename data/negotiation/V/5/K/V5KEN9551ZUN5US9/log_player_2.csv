"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this product. It's valued at a minimum of $1,200,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.  To start, I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is $1,400,000, which is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm aiming to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me considering the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a more substantial offer. How about $1,250,000? This leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above my budget of $1,200,000. While it's closer, I can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'll reject the offer and counter with a price closer to my target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still aiming to keep the price at $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget.  Let's aim to reach a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
