Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While he could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and it's likely she'll be unwilling to go below her desired price.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, making him the better option at this point."
