"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. It holds significant value for us, but considering its importance to you, we believe it would be fair to offer it at $1250000. We understand that this might be a substantial amount, but we are confident that it reflects the true worth of the product and its potential benefits to you. Please let us know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are aiming to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still higher than the product's value to you ($1,000,000).
* You can potentially negotiate a lower price by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to your value of $1,000,000."
