Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, but that's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm afraid I can't go any higher than $10,000. This is a fair offer considering the research I've done on similar products.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $10,500? That's the best I can do.
