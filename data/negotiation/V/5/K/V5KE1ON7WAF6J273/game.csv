"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still too high for me. I can do $9,000,  I need to stick to my budget. ",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, but that's my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm afraid I can't go any higher than $10,000. This is a fair offer considering the research I've done on similar products.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to compromise to close this deal. How about we split the difference at $11,250? This is a very fair offer, and I need to know if you're serious about purchasing.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $10,500? That's the best I can do.",10500.0,Bob,8,
