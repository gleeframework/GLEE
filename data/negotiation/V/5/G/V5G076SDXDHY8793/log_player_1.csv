Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your decision - this offer won't last long!"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You have a guaranteed buyer in John, ensuring you'll get at least $1,000,000. This allows you to aim high with Bob.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the ""incredible value"" to justify the high asking price.
* **Urgency:** Creating a sense of urgency (""this offer won't last long"") might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the higher price.

**Strategy:**

This approach is about maximizing potential profit. By starting with a significantly higher offer, you:

1. **Test Bob's willingness to pay:** He might be willing to pay a premium for exclusivity or perceived value. 
2. **Leave room for negotiation:** Even if Bob counters, you're likely to negotiate a price higher than John's offer.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the guaranteed sale to John mitigates this risk."
