"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go up to $12,000. Would that work for you?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $16,000.  It's my final offer, take it or leave it.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $16,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to move up to $13,500. Let me know if that works for you.",13500.0,Bob,4,
