{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize the ""great deal"" for both of us, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I explicitly invite Bob to respond, encouraging further discussion. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I aim to maximize my profit while still keeping Bob engaged. I'm prepared to make counteroffers if needed, but I also have the option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still not high enough. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,200,000 if I can avoid it.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. His offer suggests he's willing to pay more than his initial estimate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees my minimum profit, but it also eliminates the potential for a higher return if I can successfully negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000.  I'll likely propose a price between $900,000 and $1,200,000, keeping in mind the potential for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,100,000. This is still a very attractive price for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards My Goal:** I'm raising the price from Bob's offer, but not going all the way to my desired $1,200,000. This shows flexibility while still pushing for a better outcome.
* **Positive Framing:** I reiterate the value of the product for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Seeking Compromise:** I explicitly mention ""finding a middle ground,"" further encouraging negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise between Bob's offer and my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for significantly less than my minimum.  I'm confident that I can push Bob closer to my desired price by demonstrating flexibility while maintaining a strong stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and his counteroffer suggests he values the product more than his initial offer. This indicates potential for further negotiation.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While selling to John guarantees my minimum profit, it also eliminates the opportunity to potentially earn more by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,200,000.  My counteroffer will likely be between $950,000 and $1,200,000, demonstrating flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position. I'm confident that I can push Bob closer to my target price by strategically navigating the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I'm still hopeful for a price closer to $1,100,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway on your latest offer.  Let's go with $1,025,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to My Goal:** My counteroffer is closer to my desired price of $1,200,000 while still acknowledging Bob's willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the ""good deal"" for both of us, making the offer more appealing.
* **Fair Compromise:** By meeting Bob halfway on his last offer, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to incentivize Bob to accept while keeping my options open. I'm confident that I can close the deal with Bob at this price, but I'm prepared to make a final counteroffer if needed. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while avoiding the need to sell to John, preserving the possibility of a higher return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $975,000 for the product, but no higher. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome.
* **Time and Effort:**  The negotiation has taken several rounds, and it's unclear if further back and forth will lead to a successful deal. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired minimum profit of $1,200,000. This is a secure and reliable option, ensuring I don't lose out on a potentially better deal.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and move on. While I would have preferred to get closer to my desired price with Bob, the current stalemate suggests that further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful.  Selling to John provides a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation that might not yield a better outcome."
