"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway between $120 and $105. How about $112.50?",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $105, so how about $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you a slight discount from $112.50 to $111.25. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",111.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $111.25 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $108 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I can offer you a small discount from $112.50 to $109.50. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",109.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $109.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $106, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you.",106.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $106 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I can offer you a small discount from $112.50 to $110. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",110.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not willing to pay $110. I'll make one last offer: $105. If you can meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",105.0,Bob,10,
