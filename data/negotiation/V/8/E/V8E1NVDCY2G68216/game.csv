"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still hesitant at $11000.  I'm willing to go up to $10500. This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $10500, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10800. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope you'll consider it.",10800.0,Alice,5,
