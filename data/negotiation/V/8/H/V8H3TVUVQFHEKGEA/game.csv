"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still not quite there at $11,000.  How about we split the difference and I offer $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value the product brings to your business.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. However, $11,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Let's try $10,900.  I believe this price is fair for both of us and will allow us to close this deal. ",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll sell it to you for $11,100. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",11100.0,Alice,7,
