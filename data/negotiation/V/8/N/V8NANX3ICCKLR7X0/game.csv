"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's try to meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your price. $950,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of this product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,025,000?  This would allow us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
