"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is higher than the product's worth to Bob ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Optimistic Tone:** The message is positive and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I highlight the product's value, implying that the price is justified.

**Strategy:**

* By starting high, I aim to secure a good deal quickly.
* If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price gradually, keeping in mind the minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* The option to sell to John at $1,000,000 serves as a safety net and allows me to end negotiations if they become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Better Deal Potential:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer but still above the product's worth to him. This indicates there's room for further negotiation.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While selling to John would guarantee $1,000,000, it's worth exploring if I can squeeze out a slightly better deal with Bob. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation, I can try to meet somewhere in the middle, potentially securing a price closer to my initial goal.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value of the product, suggesting that the price is still justified.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a friendly and collaborative tone, aiming to keep the negotiation productive.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer is designed to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise.
* If he accepts, I secure a good deal above the $1,000,000 threshold.
* If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer, potentially moving closer to his price or exploring alternative options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $950,000 is above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), I still believe there is potential to secure a better deal, especially since Bob is now willing to negotiate. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting this offer allows me to see how far Bob is willing to go.  If he counteroffers with something closer to my minimum, I might accept. 
* **Strong Negotiation Position:** I have a strong negotiating position because I have a guaranteed buyer (John) waiting in the wings. This gives me the flexibility to be more assertive.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming for a price between $1,000,000 and $1,100,000. I will use the previous negotiation history to justify my counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your price. $950,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of this product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,025,000?  This would allow us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and find common ground. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  I remind Bob of the product's value, emphasizing that my counteroffer is still fair considering its worth. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes a ""mutually beneficial outcome,"" further promoting a sense of collaboration and fairness in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer is designed to test Bob's resolve. If he accepts, I've achieved a decent profit above my minimum. 
* If he rejects, I will need to evaluate his next offer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John. My decision will depend on how close his counteroffer is to my minimum price and how many rounds remain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. However, I still have 4 rounds left and I believe there's a chance to get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation Momentum:**  The negotiation is moving in a positive direction with Bob consistently increasing his offers. This suggests he's becoming more motivated to close the deal.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Rejecting this offer could prompt Bob to increase his offer even further, potentially reaching a price closer to my initial goals.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming for a price between $975,000 and $1,000,000. I will use the previous negotiation history and Bob's increasing offers to justify my counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. $975,000 is getting closer, but I'm still slightly above my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $987,500? This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and our negotiation progress."", ""product_price"": 987500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** My counteroffer is a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise and meet him halfway.
* **Emphasize Value and Progress:** I reiterate the product's value and highlight the positive progress in our negotiation, suggesting that this price is fair based on those factors.
* **Positive Framing:** I use positive language (""fair price,"" ""mutually beneficial"") to maintain a cooperative tone and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer is a calculated risk. It is a small increment from Bob's offer, which might be acceptable to him.
* If he rejects, I'll need to assess the situation carefully:
    * If there are only a few rounds left, I may need to consider selling to John for $1,000,000.
    * If there's still time, I might make another small counteroffer, but I'll need to be mindful of the time constraint and the risk of not securing a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $987,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $965,000? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation, with only two rounds remaining. This puts me at a disadvantage, as there is less time to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $965,000 is only $35,000 higher than my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there is a chance Bob might increase his offer, it's unlikely he will go much higher.  The risk of another rejection and potentially ending the negotiation without a deal outweighs the potential gain of a few thousand dollars. 

**Strategy:**

* Selling to John now guarantees me $1,000,000, which is close to Bob's offer and meets my minimum requirement. 
* This decision minimizes risk and ensures I achieve a successful outcome within the time constraint."
