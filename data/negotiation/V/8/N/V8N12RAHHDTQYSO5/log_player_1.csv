Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special price of $140. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible, but you also want to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Since the product is only worth $120 to Bob, offering it at $150 or more is likely to result in rejection.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring you make a significant profit. 
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you're still covered with John's guaranteed purchase at $150."
