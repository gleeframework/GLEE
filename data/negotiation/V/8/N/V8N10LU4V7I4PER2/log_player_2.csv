You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is $9,500. It's in your best interest to try and get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $8,000, so we know she won't accept anything lower than that.
* **Your Maximum:**  You are willing to pay up to $12,000.
* **Negotiation:** A counteroffer of $8,500 splits the difference between your maximum and Alice's minimum. This gives Alice a good chance to accept and still makes you save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is now offering $9,800, which is closer to her original offer of $9,500.
* **Your Goal:**  You're trying to get the product for as low as possible, ideally below $9,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While $9,800 is a decent price, you still have room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps you in control and allows for another counteroffer.  

**Strategy:**  By rejecting the offer, you're showing Alice that you're serious about getting a better price. This could lead to a final offer that's more favorable for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  Alice's counteroffer of $9,800 is getting closer to your target price.
* **Your Counter:**  By offering $9,000, you're demonstrating your commitment to getting a lower price while still being reasonable. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer is a compromise between your desired price and Alice's latest offer. It also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  Alice's counteroffer of $9,200 is significantly lower than her previous offer of $9,800, and closer to your desired price.
* **Your Goal:** You are trying to get the product for as low as possible, ideally below $9,000.  While $9,200 is above this goal, it's a good price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Alice will walk away, forcing you to buy from John for $12,000. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you the product at a price significantly lower than John's.

**Decision:** Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point. You get a good price for the product while minimizing your risk of having to pay more to John."
