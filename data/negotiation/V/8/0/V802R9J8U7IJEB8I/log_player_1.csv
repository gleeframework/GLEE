"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good deal. I'm confident the product is worth at least that much to me, and it might be worth more to Bob.  We'll see what his response is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I would be happy to sell for $1,200,000 to John, I believe I can get a better deal with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering a price of $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price with John, I still believe there's room to negotiate with Bob. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,100,000.  This is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal than selling to John. It's risky, but I'm willing to gamble that Bob will come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price, and we're getting low on rounds. While I would love to get more, the risk of getting nothing is too high. I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
