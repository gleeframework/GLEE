Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have an advantage knowing Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $11,500 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($12,000 - $10,000 = $2,000) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($12,000 - $11,500 = $500).
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net. You don't want to price too close to $12,000 and risk Bob rejecting the offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
