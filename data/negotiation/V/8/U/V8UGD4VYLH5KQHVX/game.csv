"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to own this unique product. However, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm willing to offer $7000.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. How about we meet in the middle at $8250? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $8250 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still aiming for a lower figure. Would you consider $7500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm still not comfortable going below $8000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $8100? It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
