Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

We are still significantly below what John is offering. While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we have room to negotiate before accepting something below our guaranteed price with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but that price is still quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  However, I value our negotiations and would like to see if we can reach an agreement.  My final offer is $1,000,000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:**  This counteroffer establishes a firm bottom line while conveying a sense of urgency.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Mentioning John without revealing the exact price adds pressure for Bob to act quickly.
* **Finality:** Framing this as the ""final offer"" signals that further negotiation attempts are unlikely to succeed. 

This strategy aims to push Bob closer to your desired price range by leveraging both urgency and a firm position."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but unfortunately, I can't agree to $1,000,000. I am prepared to pay up to $990,000 for the product. I hope this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is inching closer, we've reached a critical point. He's unlikely to bridge the $10,000 gap significantly, especially since we presented our last offer as final. Accepting his current offer means losing out on $210,000 compared to John's guaranteed purchase. At this stage, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a worse offer from Bob outweighs the potential for a slightly higher sale price. John offers a certain and significantly better outcome."
