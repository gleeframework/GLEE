Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:**  The message starts by highlighting the ""opportunity"" and the product's ""value,"" setting a positive tone.
* **Justification for price:** While aiming high, framing the price with ""I believe"" softens the tone and doesn't sound like a demand.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Ending with ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in discussion rather than just saying yes or no.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims high to maximize potential profit.  While Bob might reject this initial offer, it:

* **Establishes a strong starting point:** Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice is starting from a position where she could earn significantly more than her minimum.
* **Maintains the option of John:** If Bob rejects the offer outright, Alice can still sell to John at her desired minimum."
