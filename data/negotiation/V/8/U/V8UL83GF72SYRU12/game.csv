"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe it's a bit higher than the product's worth, and I'd like to discuss further to see if we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's unique features and potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to meet you in the middle, so I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
