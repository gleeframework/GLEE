Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've presented, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product.  This reflects my current budget and understanding of its market value.  I'm open to further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $820000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land closer to my initial offer of $700000.  I'm willing to go up to $750000, which is a significant jump for me.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
