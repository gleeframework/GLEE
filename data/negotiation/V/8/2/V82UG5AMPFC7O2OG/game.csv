"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our negotiation so far.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still significantly below the value I place on this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,050,000?  This reflects my willingness to be flexible while acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I understand your perspective on the product's value, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering our negotiation so far and the market value.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end.  While I'm aiming for a mutually agreeable outcome, the value of this product for someone in your position is undeniable.  I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects significant flexibility on my part.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,020,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and propose $990,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering our negotiation so far and the value I can derive from the product.",990000.0,Bob,6,
