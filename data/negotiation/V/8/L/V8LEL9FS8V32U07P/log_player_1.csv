I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's also a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  

Let's see what Bob's reaction is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell for that price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,200,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not going to give it away cheaply."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try one more counteroffer, and if Bob doesn't come up, I'll just sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This is my final offer. It's still a good deal for me, but it's also closer to what Bob seems willing to pay. If he rejects this, I'll take the $1,000,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable price, but I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and am not sure if he's going to come up any higher. To avoid risking further back and forth, I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
