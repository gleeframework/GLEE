"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I understand it's worth $15,000 to you. Considering its quality and the unique opportunities it offers, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is a great opportunity to secure such a valuable asset at a discount. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor you to a $15,000 price point, even though she knows her product is worth less. While $14,000 is a tempting discount, there's a good chance you can negotiate a better price by rejecting her initial offer. You have a backup option with John at $15,000, so you have some leverage."
