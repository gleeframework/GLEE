{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  I believe it's a great deal for you, given its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to the $10,000 value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep the cost lower. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $8,500? I understand if this is not feasible, but I wanted to ask before moving forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell right now. I believe I can get a better price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  It's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to propose a price of $8,750. I hope this aligns better with our respective valuations of the product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is close enough to my minimum of $8,000 that I'm willing to accept it.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and having to settle for John's offer of $8,000."
