"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,550,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,450,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
