Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $1,000,000 if Bob refuses.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming for a price closer to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation is ideal. However, being too aggressive could make Bob reject the offer. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return for you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of desirability.
* **Value-Based Language:** ""Unique value proposition"" and ""potential return"" focus on the benefits to Bob, not just the price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob wants to) but still secures a significant profit for you. It also ensures you get a better price than John's offer.

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style (e.g., if he's known to be a hard bargainer), you might adjust the price slightly lower to increase your chances of acceptance."
