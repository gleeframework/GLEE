Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $80 to Bob, I'll start with a slightly higher price to test the waters. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $85}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $75. Since the product is worth at least $80 to Bob, I think I can do better than that.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get closer to the true value of the product. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": $78}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I've made a counteroffer to Bob. Here it is:

{""product_price"": $78}

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept or make another counteroffer!"
