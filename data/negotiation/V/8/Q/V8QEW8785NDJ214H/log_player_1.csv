"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. It's incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. I'm asking for $1,500,000 to start the negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $1,500,000, we're setting a high anchor. Even if Bob rejects this initial price, it can influence his counteroffers to be closer to our desired range.

We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy in the next round based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd need you to come down significantly on the price. How about $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. While his message suggests he's interested,  accepting such a low offer would mean losing out on a substantial amount of potential profit. We're still in the early rounds of negotiation, so it's worth trying to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $750,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the unique benefits this product offers."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Firm:** We're lowering our price by $200,000 to show Bob we're willing to negotiate. However, we're still holding firm above the $1,000,000 mark. 
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and counter Bob's attempt to anchor the negotiation too low. 

We'll continue to assess Bob's responses and adjust our strategy accordingly. We still have the option to walk away and sell to John for our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit high for my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $900,000 is still below our $1,000,000 minimum. Bob's use of the phrase ""middle ground"" suggests he's willing to move further. We'll reject this offer to signal we're looking for a price closer to our last counteroffer while remaining open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to find a middle ground.  How about we meet halfway between our last two offers at $1,100,000? This reflects my willingness to compromise while acknowledging the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Stay Firm:** Offering $1,100,000 represents a significant compromise from our previous offer but keeps us above our minimum.  
* **Framing:** By framing it as ""meeting halfway,"" we emphasize fairness and our effort to find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Time Consideration:** We're over halfway through the rounds, and this offer encourages Bob to make a serious move if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a touch outside my budget. How about we settle at $975,000? This demonstrates my serious interest while recognizing the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision point. Bob's offer of $975,000 is very close to our $1,000,000 minimum, and he's clearly expressed serious interest. However, we're only $25,000 away from our minimum, and we still have a few rounds left to negotiate. There's a chance we can secure a slightly better deal.

We'll reject this offer to signal that we're very close to our limit, but we're open to see if Bob will meet our target price. We'll likely present a final offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your understanding of the value of this product.  I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're making it clear that this is our final offer and our absolute minimum acceptable price.
* **Firm but Fair:**  By holding firm at our $1,000,000 minimum, we're showing that we value our product and our time.
* **Decision Time:**  This offer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He can choose to accept a fair deal or risk losing out on the product entirely."
