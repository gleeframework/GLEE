"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. It's incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. I'm asking for $1,500,000 to start the negotiations.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd need you to come down significantly on the price. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $750,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the unique benefits this product offers.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit high for my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a middle ground.  How about we meet halfway between our last two offers at $1,100,000? This reflects my willingness to compromise while acknowledging the true value of this product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a touch outside my budget. How about we settle at $975,000? This demonstrates my serious interest while recognizing the value of your product.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your understanding of the value of this product.  I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
