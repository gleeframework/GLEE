"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,200 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $10,800. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident that this price reflects the product's value fairly.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",10800.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $11,000, but I'll throw in a small bonus package that will add significant value to the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,7,
