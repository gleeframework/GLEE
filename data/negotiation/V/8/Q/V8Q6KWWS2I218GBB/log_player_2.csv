"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I'm looking for a minimum of $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and she's asking for $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **You're not desperate:** You have the option to buy from John for $15,000, so you don't need to settle for Alice's first offer.
* **Negotiation is possible:** By rejecting, you open the door to a counteroffer and a potential lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showing that you're serious about negotiating.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  $10,500 is still above Alice's value of $10,000, suggesting a potential middle ground.
* **Sets a clear expectation:**  You've stated your price point upfront, making it clear what you're willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11750. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, while also being competitive. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is closer to your price:** She's come down from $12,000 to $11,750, which is closer to your counteroffer of $10,500. 
* **A reasonable compromise:** This offer is a good middle ground between both of your positions.  
* **No need to risk further negotiation:** There's a chance Alice could reject your next counteroffer, leading to more rounds and a risk of reaching the 10-round limit. Accepting this offer is a safe move that gets you the product for a price below your initial limit of $15,000."
