"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It makes more sense to reject and see if you can get a lower price.  Buying from John immediately is an option, but it might be worth seeing if you can negotiate a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price, which is what John is offering.  This sets a clear baseline and shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  It's unlikely she'll accept this immediately, but it's a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  It's worth exploring if there's more room for compromise before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still sticking to my budget.  It's a strategic move to show flexibility without giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now within the range of my budget, I'm still aiming to save more money.  I'm confident that with a bit more negotiation, I can get the price down closer to my target.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue exploring if a better deal is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but still keeping it below Alice's current offer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not going to jump at the first decent offer.  It's a balance between showing commitment and pushing for the best possible price.  With only a few rounds left, I need to start getting closer to Alice's bottom line."
