Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Situation**

* **Your Minimum:** You absolutely won't sell below $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 with John.

**Strategy**

You have a strong position. Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you don't need to desperately negotiate with Bob.  Your goal is to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium over his perceived value.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,650,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value but not exorbitantly high.
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, subtly implying other interested parties.
* **No Room for Haggling (Initially):**  The initial offer is firm, encouraging Bob to consider the value seriously.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get a great deal at $150,000 above your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter-offer. You have room to negotiate down slightly, but never below $1,500,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You proceed with selling to John at your guaranteed price.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
