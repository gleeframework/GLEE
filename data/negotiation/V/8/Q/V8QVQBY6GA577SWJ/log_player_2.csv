"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely useful. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly below my maximum budget of $1,500,000. While it's a good starting point, there's room for negotiation to save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still below my maximum budget.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still within my budget, and it's a significant improvement over her initial offer. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and I'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting Alice's offer allows me to secure the product for a price that's both acceptable and saves me a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John."
