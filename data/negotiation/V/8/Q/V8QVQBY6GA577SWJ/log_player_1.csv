Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still below my maximum budget.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
