Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. Could we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $120.  I'll try to negotiate a bit more in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to stick to my original budget of $100 if possible. Could we perhaps find a middle ground?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm running out of rounds, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price of $110. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
