"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,600,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 to potentially close this deal quickly.  This offer reflects the product's significant potential and is a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's work towards this figure,  as it's a reasonable middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
