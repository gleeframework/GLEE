Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  You're giving Bob a good deal, making him more likely to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price a bit, but still potentially make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still significantly below your desired profit margin. You have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to your target price of $120.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** $105 is just $5 away from your original offer of $110, which was already a good price for you. 
* **Better than selling to John:** Selling to John for $80 would leave you with a smaller profit. 
* **Bob's final offer:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, meaning further negotiation might be futile and could lead to a breakdown in the deal, ultimately resulting in selling to John for a lower price.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision, securing a decent profit while avoiding the risk of losing the sale altogether."
