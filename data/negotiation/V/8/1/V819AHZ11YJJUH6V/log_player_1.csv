"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair"" price to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open-Ended:**  The message invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and share his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget constraints, I'm prepared to offer $800000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us and I'm confident this product will be valuable to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:** I have 9 rounds remaining, and I believe I can negotiate a better price. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,250,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, while offering you a significant value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise by lowering my price but still staying above my minimum.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value the product offers Bob, emphasizing its potential for him.
* **Clear Price Point:** I'm presenting a specific counteroffer for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1000000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer, $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** With 6 rounds left, I believe there's still room for negotiation and a possibility Bob might increase his offer further.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:**  However, selling to John for $1,200,000 is always a viable option, so I'm keeping that in mind as a backup."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's try one more time. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a price that will be mutually beneficial. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm narrowing the gap by offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, showing flexibility.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $1,150,000 is still a good price for him considering the potential value of the product.
* **Finality:** I'm phrasing the message to suggest this could be the final offer, creating a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1150000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1050000, which is a fair compromise considering our previous offers.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, the pressure is mounting, but I'm not desperate enough to accept a price below my minimum.
* **John as a Safe Backup:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 remains a solid backup option. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still a chance Bob might increase his offer further, especially with fewer rounds remaining."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 as a final compromise.

```
