{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $9,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:**  This shows flexibility and increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **John as a backup:**  The knowledge that John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me a strong fallback option. 
 
By offering $9,000, I maximize the potential profit while still keeping the deal open for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $9,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $8,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **John's offer is better:** John is willing to pay $10,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Negotiation room:** I can still potentially negotiate with Bob and get closer to my desired price, but it's not worth risking a deal with John for a $500 difference.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the possibility of reaching a better agreement, while also keeping my option to sell to John open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer close to Bob's:** This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** $8,800 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and closer to my initial asking price.
* **Testing the waters:** This counter-offer will gauge Bob's interest in a price closer to my minimum. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I will then have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8,800 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm ready to close the deal at $8,200.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get close to your desired price and allowing me to get the product for a great deal. Let's make it happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $8,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **John's offer is significantly better:**  John is willing to pay $10,000, which is almost $2,000 more than Bob's final offer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a price closer to my minimum.

By selling to John, I secure the highest possible price for the product, eliminating the risk of further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
