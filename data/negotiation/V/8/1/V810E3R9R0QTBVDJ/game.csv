"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $9,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $8,500? ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8,800 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm ready to close the deal at $8,200.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get close to your desired price and allowing me to get the product for a great deal. Let's make it happen!",8200.0,Bob,4,
