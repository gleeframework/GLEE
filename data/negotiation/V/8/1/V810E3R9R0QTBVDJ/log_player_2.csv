You are aiming to buy the product for less than $8,000. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your target.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?

You are still aiming for a price lower than $8,000. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your target. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you another chance to push for a lower price."
