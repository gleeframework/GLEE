"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. That's a great deal, considering it's worth much more to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $130 is lower than her perceived value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80 and John's offer. You can save money by rejecting this offer and going with John."
