"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $12500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I have 8 more rounds to try and get a better price, and selling to John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $13,250?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. "", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $13250 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $12500.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below what I know the product is worth. I have 6 more rounds to try and get a better price, and selling to John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $13,000? That's a very fair price considering the value of this product. Let's try to meet in the middle. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still only able to offer $12500.  I'm confident this is a fair price given my budget constraints.  Let me know if you're willing to reconsider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  I've gone back and forth with Bob for a few rounds now, and it seems we're at an impasse. I've been willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to drop below my minimum price. John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm happy with, so I'm going to take that option."
