Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $15,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. Could you meet me halfway at $17,500?"", ""product_price"": 17500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $17,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $16,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  How about we settle at $16,750 and we have a deal?"", ""product_price"": 16750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, and $16,750 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16,200 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher and we're already above John's offer. Taking the $16,200 is better than risking a lower counteroffer or having to settle for $15,000 from John."
