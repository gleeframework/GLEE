"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to buy the product, but  $1,200,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $850,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. Would you be willing to settle around $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,000,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle at $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget to $1,000,000. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is just $50,000 above your offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
