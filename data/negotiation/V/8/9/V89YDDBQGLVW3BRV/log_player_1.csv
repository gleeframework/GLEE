Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is higher than I'm willing to go. I'm confident this product is valuable, but my budget only allows me to spend up to $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Bob's offer:

Bob is unlikely to go higher and my guaranteed sale to John meets my minimum price. It makes the most sense to sell to John at this point."
