Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500.  I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a final price higher than $10,000 (John's offer). 
* **Strong but Fair:** The message positions the price as fair while still emphasizing the product's value to Bob."
