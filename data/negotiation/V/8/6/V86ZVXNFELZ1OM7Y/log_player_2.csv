"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is a better price than John's $150, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  There's room for negotiation, as the product is worth $100 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $110? I'm really interested in the product, and this price would make it work for me."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I understand your concern about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still not ideal. Bob is still better off trying to negotiate further. There's still room to get a lower price, especially since Alice is already willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50?  I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $130. I think it's a great price for this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's meet in the middle and try to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While $130 is still more than Bob's ideal price, it's a significant improvement from her previous offer and is still better than John's $150.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a much lower price, and Bob is better off accepting the offer to avoid risking a further stalemate or a higher price from John."
