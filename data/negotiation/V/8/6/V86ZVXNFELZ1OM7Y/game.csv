"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $110? I'm really interested in the product, and this price would make it work for me.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I understand your concern about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50?  I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price would be fair for both of us.",117.5,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob! I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $130. I think it's a great price for this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's meet in the middle and try to find a compromise.",130.0,Alice,5,
