Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential benefits.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I appreciate his interest, $800,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. I believe I can negotiate a better price."

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, his offers are still significantly below what I consider the product's true value.  Selling to John ensures I get a fair price and avoids further negotiation."
