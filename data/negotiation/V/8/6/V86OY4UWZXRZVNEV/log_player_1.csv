Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it's important to set the initial bar high and see how Bob reacts. I want to gauge his interest and understand his potential budget before considering lower offers.  If he rejects, we can then negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm not in a rush and want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering Bob $900,000. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for profit.  It's also a reasonable midpoint between my initial offer and his counter-offer, making it a potentially appealing option for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, $850,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better price from Bob in the next round.  It's time to close the deal."
