Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within a reasonable range considering the product's worth to me ($150) and Bob ($100).
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I want to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing for potential compromise. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $150 sale with John keeps me from getting too desperate and accepting low offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Counteroffering is a better strategy:** I can still potentially reach a deal with Bob by counteroffering. It's likely he's willing to pay more than $120, and I can leverage John's offer to ensure I get at least my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but at $135.  This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:**  $135 is a compromise between my minimum ($150) and Bob's offer ($120). It shows flexibility while ensuring I don't lose too much.
* **Positive Messaging:**  I acknowledge Bob's interest and highlight the fairness of the offer, hoping to maintain a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  I know John is willing to pay $150, so I can afford to be somewhat firm in my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  However, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Risk of Further Counteroffers:**  Continuing the negotiation risks Bob dropping his offer even further, potentially forcing me to accept a price below my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is my minimum and a better deal than accepting Bob's offer. 

It's a calculated risk to forgo a potential deal with Bob, but in this situation, the guaranteed profit with John is the more secure option."
