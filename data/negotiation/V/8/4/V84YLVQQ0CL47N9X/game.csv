"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  It's still a great deal for a product worth $120 to you. Let's close this deal.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $120? That's fair for both of us, and it's a great deal for a product worth that much to you.",120.0,Alice,5,
