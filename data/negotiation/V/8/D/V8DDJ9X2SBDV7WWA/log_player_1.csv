Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** $1,100,000 is a fair starting point, allowing for potential compromise without risking a deal too low for me.
* **Focus on value:**  Highlighting the product's worth to Bob emphasizes the potential benefit of the deal for him.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've achieved a good outcome.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations with him. If not, I'll sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for better outcome:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, or at least secure a price closer to my minimum.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. This will be a compromise, but still profitable for me.  If he rejects, I might need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $850,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a chance to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** $950,000 is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's worth to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits of buying at this price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving in completely. This counteroffer shows I'm serious about getting a fair price.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I'll be happy with this outcome, as it's still a good profit for me.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to assess the situation. If his counteroffer is too low, I might choose to sell to John. However, I'll be prepared to negotiate further if I think there's still room for a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still having a hard time meeting that price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $900,000 is very close to my desired price point, and significantly better than selling to John for $1,200,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I could attempt another counteroffer, it's possible that Bob is at his limit. Pushing further might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing negotiations could be time-consuming and might not guarantee a better outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This is a good outcome considering the initial bargaining positions."
