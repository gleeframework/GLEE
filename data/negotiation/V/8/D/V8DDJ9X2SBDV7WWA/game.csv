"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $850,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a chance to close the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still having a hard time meeting that price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
