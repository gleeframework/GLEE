"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be worth the same to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
