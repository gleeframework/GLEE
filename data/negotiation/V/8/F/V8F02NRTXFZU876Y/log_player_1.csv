Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **Shows you're willing to deal:**  By offering a price, you're demonstrating your eagerness to sell, which can be persuasive.

This is just a starting point. Remember, you can adjust your offer and counteroffers based on Bob's responses, your assessment of his willingness to pay, and the risk of losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While you want to sell, accepting his offer would mean losing money. It's better to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $11,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'd be happy to do the deal for $12,500.  This price still leaves you with a good margin, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is good:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,500 is still above your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you don't lose money.
* **It's a reasonable compromise:**  It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **It emphasizes value:**  The message reiterates the product's value for Bob, reminding him of the benefit of a deal.

Remember, you're aiming for a price that's as close to $15,000 as possible, but you also want to close the deal.  This counteroffer balances these priorities."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,750 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While you want to sell for the best possible price, you're also at risk of going back and forth with Bob indefinitely.  Since John is offering you your minimum price, it's the safest option to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
