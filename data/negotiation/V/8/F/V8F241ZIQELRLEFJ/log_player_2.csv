"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested if you could come down to $105.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is still within Alice's desired profit margin ($105 is more than her $120 worth), but is closer to Bob's maximum price point.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $110? Let's meet in the middle!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about $108?  That's a fair compromise and lets us both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting closer to his desired price point, but is still leaving room for negotiation.
