"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible while staying within his budget. He's starting with a counteroffer of $12,500, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a strong starting point that demonstrates Bob's serious intent to purchase the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price, there's also the risk of Alice continually rejecting his offers.  Since John is offering the product for exactly Bob's maximum budget, it's the most sensible decision to buy from John and secure the product without exceeding his financial limit."
