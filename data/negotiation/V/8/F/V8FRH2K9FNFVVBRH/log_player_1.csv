Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still above Bob's estimated value. This gives me room to negotiate while leaving a significant profit margin for myself. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I could accept it, it would result in a lower profit than selling to John. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to settle for his low price. I hope this encourages Bob to come up in his offer."
