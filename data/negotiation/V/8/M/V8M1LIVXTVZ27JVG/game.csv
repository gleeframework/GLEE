"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $15,000 is still quite a gap. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's a very fair price for a product of this quality.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $10,000 is still my absolute maximum.  If you're not able to meet that, I'll have to go with John's offer. ",10000.0,Bob,4,
