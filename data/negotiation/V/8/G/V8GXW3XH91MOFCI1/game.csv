"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable offer. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair compromise and would like to hear your thoughts on it.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit below what I'm looking for. This product has significant long-term value that I believe justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your point about the product's long-term value, but I'm still hesitant to go above $1,800,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $1,900,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
