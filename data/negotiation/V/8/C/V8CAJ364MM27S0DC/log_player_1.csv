"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm going to try to get closer to my target price. I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a good price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $100. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $95 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $90, so how about we try $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $92.50 is getting closer to my target price. While I'd love to get closer to $100, I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to sell to John for $80.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
