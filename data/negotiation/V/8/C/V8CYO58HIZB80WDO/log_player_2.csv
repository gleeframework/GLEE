Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value I think the product holds, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it. What do you think?
