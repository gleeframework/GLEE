While $10,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Alice to come down further."

$9,800 is within my budget, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate down from her initial price.  At this point, it's likely I'll save more money by accepting this offer than by continuing to negotiate or going to John."
