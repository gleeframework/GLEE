"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I recognize its value, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counter with an offer of $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but it's still above my target. There's still room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to explore those options before committing to a price that isn't ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my end.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price of $850,000. While it's closer to my last counteroffer, it's not a deal-breaker. I'm still willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand your position, $920,000 is still beyond my comfortable price point.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to counter with an offer of $915,000. This price is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has shown some flexibility, her offer of $915,000 is still above my target price.  I'm not willing to pay this much, but I believe we can still reach an agreement with a few more rounds of negotiation.  There's a chance that Alice may be willing to compromise further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  It's time for a final compromise. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to counter with an offer of $910,000. This price is a slight increase from your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where Alice's offers are still above my desired price, and with only two rounds left, I need to make a decision. It's likely that even if I reject this offer and make a counteroffer, Alice will not agree. I've reached the point where the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. Buying from John at $1,200,000, while not ideal, ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
