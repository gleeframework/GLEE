Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is better than John's $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to establish a lower negotiation range.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it reflects the value you see in the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```
