"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it reflects the value you see in the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This shows my commitment to reaching an agreement, and I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
