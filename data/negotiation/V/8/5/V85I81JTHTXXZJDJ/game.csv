"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $920,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my limits.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $920,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $935,000?  It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to where we want to be.",935000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  we're so close to a deal!  How about we try $932,000?  It's only a small difference from your last offer, and I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us.",932000.0,Alice,7,
