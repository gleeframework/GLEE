Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher gives us negotiation room while still being within a potentially acceptable range.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's ""true worth and potential,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of value closer to our asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message implies a willingness to discuss the price further, allowing Bob to feel involved and potentially reach a mutually agreeable deal.

**Worst Case Scenario:** Bob rejects the offer, and we sell to John for our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.

**Best Case Scenario:**  Bob accepts our offer, or we negotiate down to a price significantly higher than $800,000."
