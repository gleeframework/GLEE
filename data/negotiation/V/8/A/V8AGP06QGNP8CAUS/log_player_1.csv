**Reasoning:**

Bob has steadily decreased his offer and presented his ""final offer"" of $11,000. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase from this point.  Since John offers a guaranteed $10,000, it's more profitable to sell to John than to continue haggling with Bob and risk getting even less."
