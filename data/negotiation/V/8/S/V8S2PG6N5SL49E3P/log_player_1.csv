Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, aiming to maximize my profit. However, I'm aware it's a bit high and open to negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay that much or if he'll counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,500. It's a compromise that's closer to his offer, but still above my minimum. I hope this will encourage Bob to accept and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting closer. Further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to accept his offer now and secure a sale than risk a counteroffer that could be lower."
