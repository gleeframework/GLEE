"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $70 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm not sure $85 is a good deal for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me in the middle?,75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $82.  This is a fair price considering the value to you. Let's close this deal.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $82, so how about $78.50?",78.5,Bob,6,
