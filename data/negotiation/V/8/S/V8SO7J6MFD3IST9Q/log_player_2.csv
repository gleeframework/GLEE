# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
