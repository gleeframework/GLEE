"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do  $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $975,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $900,000. How about $910,000?",910000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $910,000. However, I'm willing to meet you closer to your target. How about we try $935,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but still a good compromise.",935000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close!  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am interested in buying, but I have a strict budget.  My last offer is $920,000.  Let me know if this works for you.",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $925,000. It's the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle again and try $927,500. It's a fair compromise.",927500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting a bit ridiculous.  I appreciate that your price has come down, but I need you to move a little more to make this work for me.  $922,500 is my final offer.",922500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $927,000. It's the minimum price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we try $924,500? It's the last compromise I'm willing to make.",924500.0,Alice,9,
