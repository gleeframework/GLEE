Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $14,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
