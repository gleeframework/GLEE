"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price of $18,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's not a good deal for Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000. This is my final counteroffer, so let's see if we can seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. This is my final compromise, so let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  At this point, Bob has two options: 

* **Continue negotiating:** Bob could make another counteroffer, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that the negotiation will drag on for too long. 
* **Buy from John:** John is offering the product for Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. This is the most financially sound decision, as it ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
