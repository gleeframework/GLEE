{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $120 but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals a willingness to compromise.  I'm eager to see if Bob will bite, or if he'll counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to go that low yet. I know the product is worth more to me than that and I believe I can get closer to my target price of $150.  I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher and see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $130.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a middle ground here, hoping to meet Bob halfway. It's still a good price for me, considering my minimum value is $150. Let's see if he'll accept this compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $125 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to settle for that price.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price of $150, especially since I have a backup buyer in John. I'll make another counteroffer and see if Bob will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really want to work with you on this, but I can't go any lower than $135. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to reach my goal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm sticking with a price that's more comfortable for me.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that I'm being flexible, but I'm also firm about my bottom line.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement!"
