I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $12,000 is still too low for me, and I think I can do better."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about $16,000?  That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000}

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm not too worried about losing the deal to Bob as I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. Even though Bob is getting closer to my desired price, we're running out of rounds. I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price, especially since I know John is willing to pay my minimum."
