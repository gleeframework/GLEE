Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm firm on my offer of $100. Let's see if we can close this deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $115. This is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm going to stick with my offer of $100. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to look at other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
