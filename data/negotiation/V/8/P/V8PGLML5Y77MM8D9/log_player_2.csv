{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500, which is still above Alice's value of $8,000, leaving some room for profit for her. This is a significant reduction from the initial offer of $9,500, demonstrating Bob's desire to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. While it's lower than her initial offer, Bob is still trying to get a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $9,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to stay within his budget.  This price is also a good middle ground between Alice's offer of $9,750 and Bob's previous offer of $8,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to her original price and further away from Bob's desired price. Bob is running out of rounds and the risk of not getting a deal is increasing. Buying from John at $12,000 guarantees Bob the product, even if it is not the ideal price. He might get a better deal later, but there's no guarantee, and it's not worth the risk."
