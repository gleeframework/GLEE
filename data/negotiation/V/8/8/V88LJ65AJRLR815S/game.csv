"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $13,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the product's value.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below what I can accept. Let's meet in the middle - how about $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go to $9,500.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good compromise given our positions.",9500.0,Bob,4,
