{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $10,000. I know it's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a high price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the product's value, hoping to make Bob more interested. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter-offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  While I'd prefer more, it's better to secure the sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially losing out to John."
