"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it has the potential to be highly beneficial to you. While I'm not at liberty to disclose the specifics of the product, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. Please let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as buying from John.  Since Bob's goal is to save money, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting the offer keeps the option open to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller."
