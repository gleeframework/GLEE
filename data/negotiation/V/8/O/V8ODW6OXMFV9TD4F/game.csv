"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for your product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering its value to me.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's finalize this now before we lose too much time.",9000.0,Bob,6,
