"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's lower than what it's worth to me but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a quick deal with Bob, but I'm ready to counter if he rejects my offer and also have the option to go with John for my minimum price if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for your product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,500 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering its value to me.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still maintains a good profit margin for me.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept, but I'm ready to counter further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite there. I believe I can still push for a higher price, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's latest offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. This should put pressure on Bob to accept, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's finalize this now before we lose too much time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call. While $9,000 is closer to my ideal, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and Bob seems unwilling to budge.  With only a few rounds left, it's a risk to keep negotiating.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John to avoid the possibility of a lower price or a breakdown in negotiations."
