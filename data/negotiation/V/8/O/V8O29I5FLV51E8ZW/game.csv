"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me, but I am interested.  How about we start at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair offer reflecting the value this product brings.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $1,400,000 is still  more than I'm looking to spend. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
