"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I  believe the product is worth. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $17,000 is still outside my budget. I can do $12,000, which I think is a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a solution.  How about $15,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and represents a good deal for you.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $13,000. Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,6,
