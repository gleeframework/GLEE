"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product and your enthusiasm, but I was hoping to stay within a budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you have a budget constraint, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. I can meet you halfway between $100 and my initial offer of $120. How about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to keep the price at or below $100 if possible. Could we possibly come to an agreement at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,,
