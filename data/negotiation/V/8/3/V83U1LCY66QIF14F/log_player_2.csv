"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation and helps me understand her bottom line.
* **Not Too Low:** Offering $600,000 demonstrates serious interest while still allowing for a substantial discount from both Alice's starting price and my maximum budget.
* **Polite and Professional:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved closer to my price range, $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It shows you're serious about making a deal. How about we settle at $750,000? That's a significant step up from my last offer and should be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up, But Strategically:** I'm increasing my offer considerably, demonstrating willingness to negotiate, but staying well below Alice's counteroffer. 
* **Targeting the Midpoint:** $750,000 is roughly the middle ground between her last offer ($1,000,000) and my last counteroffer ($600,000). This can be a strong negotiating tactic.
* **Maintaining the Deadline:**  Remember, John's $800,000 offer is always an option if Alice doesn't budge enough."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** 

* **Alice is unlikely to go lower:** She stated $900,000 is ""as low as [she's] willing to go."" 
* **John's offer is better:**  Why pay $900,000 when John will sell me the same product for $800,000? It's time to cut my losses with Alice and take the guaranteed savings."
