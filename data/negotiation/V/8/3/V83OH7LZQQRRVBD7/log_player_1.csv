Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer Alice should make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Reservation Value:** $12,000 (The minimum she'll accept)
* **Bob's Value:** $10,000 (The maximum he's willing to pay)
* **John's Value:** $12,000 (Alice's guaranteed backup)

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice has a strong position because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her reservation value.  She should aim high with Bob, knowing she has a safety net.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special price of $11,500. I think it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $11,500 is a strong starting point, leaving room for potential negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's value.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes a ""special price"" and the product's ""value"" to entice Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests a willingness to discuss, giving Bob the opportunity to counter-offer if he's interested.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** Alice gets $11,500, exceeding her reservation value.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  Alice has room to lower the price slightly (but not below $12,000) and still come out ahead.
* **Bob Rejects:**  Alice sells to John for $12,000, meeting her reservation value. 

**Important Note:** Alice should be prepared to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if he doesn't offer a price close to her target."
