Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefit you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit beyond the $1,000,000 fallback offer from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($1,400,000) leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still very favorable for Alice. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""potential value"" to entice Bob while justifying the high initial price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining a strong position should he choose to negotiate or decline the offer."
