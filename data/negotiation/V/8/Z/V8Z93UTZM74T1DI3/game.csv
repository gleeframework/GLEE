"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is closer to a fair deal, it's still a significant gap from what I have in mind.  I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise, reflecting the product's value while recognizing your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1,600,000 is still more than I can reasonably pay. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value I place on the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
