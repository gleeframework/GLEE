"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum budget for this product is $800,000. If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
