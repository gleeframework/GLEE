``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $700,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum budget for this product is $800,000. If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $800,000 is at my minimum acceptable price.  This deal is still better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  It's time to close the deal."
