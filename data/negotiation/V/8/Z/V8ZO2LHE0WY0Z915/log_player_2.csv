"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's initial offer of $11,000 is higher than Bob's desired price of $12,000.
* It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $9,500 for the product? I think it's a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming for a price closer to his desired $12,000 limit. 
* A counteroffer of $9,500 is a significant drop from Alice's offer of $11,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also sets a firm boundary for his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make $11,500 to be comfortable. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,750 is still higher than Bob's desired price of $12,000. However, it's a significant drop from her previous offer of $11,000.
* Bob is in a good position to accept this offer, as it's within his budget and he's already had a few rounds of negotiation.
* Buying from John for $12,000 would be more expensive, and Bob can save $250 by accepting Alice's offer."
