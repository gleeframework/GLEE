Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I can still potentially get a better price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $13,000.  We have a few more rounds to go before I need to consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not able to go lower than $11,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still represents a great deal for you.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'd like to negotiate some extras to sweeten the deal. Would you be willing to include some additional services or support with the purchase of the product at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to his price, I'm not yet willing to concede on the price without knowing exactly what the ""extras"" he wants are. It's important to keep the negotiation focused on the product price before adding in additional elements. We still have a few more rounds to try and get a price I'm happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not comfortable adding extras at this point. My final offer for the product is $11,250. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my own needs. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, but I'm still at $11,000. I'm not willing to go any higher. Is this a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're only $250 apart, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate. This is a good price and it's worth closing the deal rather than risking getting a lower price from John."
