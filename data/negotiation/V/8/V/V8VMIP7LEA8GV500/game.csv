"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not able to go lower than $11,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still represents a great deal for you.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'd like to negotiate some extras to sweeten the deal. Would you be willing to include some additional services or support with the purchase of the product at this price?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not comfortable adding extras at this point. My final offer for the product is $11,250. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my own needs. Let's finalize this deal.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and effort, but I'm still at $11,000. I'm not willing to go any higher. Is this a deal?",11000.0,Bob,8,
