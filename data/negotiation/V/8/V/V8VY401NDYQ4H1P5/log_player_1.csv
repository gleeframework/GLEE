Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to your business, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Strong Starting Point:** Offering a price of $1,350,000 allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob's specific business increases the perceived worth and justifies the high price. 
* **Alternative:** By having John as a backup buyer, you have a strong fallback position, giving you leverage in the negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to give more room for negotiation.
* **Market Conditions:**  Consider any external factors that might influence Bob's willingness to pay, such as competitor products or industry trends."
