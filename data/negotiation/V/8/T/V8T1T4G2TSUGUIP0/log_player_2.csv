It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $100 is a good price, but I want to see if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm going to try offering $80. It's a significant drop from $100, but it's still within my budget. If Alice rejects this, I'll be prepared to go up a bit, but I'm hoping she'll see the value in getting this deal done."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is coming back up to $90, but I'm still hopeful I can get a better price. I'll counter with something a bit higher than my previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'll go up a bit to $85. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm still holding out for a slightly lower price."
