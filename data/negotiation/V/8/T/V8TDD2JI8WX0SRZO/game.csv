"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $105.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $105, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's as low as I can go.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to get this deal done, but $108 is still a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $106? It's a fair compromise for both of us.",106.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to compromise further, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. I'm willing to go down to $109, but that's as low as I can go.",109.0,Alice,7,
