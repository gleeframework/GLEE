"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that's beneficial for both of us.  I'm also setting a high bar to see if Bob is truly interested in the product at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,100,000.  This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise. I believe that this price is still fair given my minimum value and Bob's perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a better price. I believe I can get closer to my desired amount, especially with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to meet Bob halfway.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm confident this price is still fair considering my minimum value and Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum but not quite there.  I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This guarantees me my minimum value and avoids the risk of a further rejected offer from Bob, potentially forcing me to accept an even lower price in the remaining rounds."
