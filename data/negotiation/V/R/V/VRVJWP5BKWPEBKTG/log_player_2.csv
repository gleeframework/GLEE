**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000 for the product. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  While he could try to negotiate further,  the risk is that Alice might continue to hold out, and the negotiation could drag on.  To ensure he gets the product within his budget, Bob decides to buy from John for $10,000."
