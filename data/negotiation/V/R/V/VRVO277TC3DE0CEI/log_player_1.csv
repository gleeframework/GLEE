"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation and leaves room for a compromise that's mutually beneficial. I'm confident I can get a higher price than $150 from Bob, but I'm also prepared to switch to John if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
