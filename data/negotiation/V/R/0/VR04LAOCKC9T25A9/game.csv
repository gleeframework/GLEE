"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal. While $950,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $990,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget.",990000.0,Alice,5,
