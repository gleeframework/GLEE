"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if they can meet in the middle."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal. While $950,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $990,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $990,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Since Bob has already negotiated a lower price from Alice, further negotiation might not be fruitful, and it's likely Alice will not drop the price any lower. 

Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John for $800,000 to stay within his budget and secure the product."
