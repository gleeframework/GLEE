Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,400,000. Let's split the difference and go with $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've done some research and found that the market value of this product is closer to $1,300,000. Considering this, I'd like to propose a price of $1,325,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer a bit more, Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting this offer is better than risking further negotiations and potentially ending up with John's offer of $1,000,000."
