"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $10,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $10,000 is still higher than the product's worth to Bob ($12,000).  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $9,500 for the product. This is my best offer at this time, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum price of $12,000 and closer to his target price.  While there's potential for further negotiation, accepting the offer minimizes the risk of Alice rejecting any future counteroffers or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price."
