"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $10,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $9,500 for the product. This is my best offer at this time, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
