"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price. I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to her ($120). This suggests there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum acceptable price ($120). It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I can meet you in the middle at $137.50. Would you be interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price point, but it's still above the product's worth to her ($120). There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially allows for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $137.50 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her previous offer and your last offer. It shows you're actively trying to reach an agreement while still staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $138, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $138 is only $3 higher than your last counteroffer of $135 and still within your budget. Accepting this offer means securing the product at a reasonable price, saving you money compared to buying from John. The potential for a better deal in future rounds is outweighed by the risk of either Alice backing out completely or you having to buy from John for a higher price."
