"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a good value for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 just doesn't work for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1700000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and would still be a good deal for you considering the value you place on the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1000000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. $1600000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to your desired price while remaining within my range.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1200000 is getting closer to my expectations, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1400000? This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. It's a win-win scenario for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
