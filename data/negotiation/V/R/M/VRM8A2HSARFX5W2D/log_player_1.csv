"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, just below Bob's estimated value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but also shows him I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing the negotiation. I'm confident I can convince Bob to pay more, as his estimated value for the product is higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still keeping it above Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  Bob is clearly interested in the product and I have a good sense of his maximum willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still keeping it above Bob's latest offer. This shows him that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not going to give away the product for a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a better deal. I have only 4 rounds left, but I think I can still convince Bob to pay more.  I'll be more willing to consider selling to John if I see Bob isn't willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000} 
```

I'm making a small counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap between his offer and my desired price. I'm hoping this shows him I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire and I'm starting to get nervous. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I don't think I can squeeze much more out of him in the remaining rounds. Selling to John will guarantee me a decent profit, and it's less risky than trying to push Bob further."
