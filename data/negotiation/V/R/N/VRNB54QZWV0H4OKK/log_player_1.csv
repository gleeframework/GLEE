Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position that sets the tone for the negotiation. It also gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm counter-offering with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $850,000. This offer is a significant step closer to my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I'm hoping this will be more attractive to Bob, while still ensuring I get a decent return on my product."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 finally meets my minimum threshold. It's time to accept and close the deal.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee of a higher offer, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer is the best option for maximizing my earnings."
