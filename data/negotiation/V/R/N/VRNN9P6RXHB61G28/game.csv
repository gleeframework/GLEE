"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. I'm open to discussing further, but I won't go any lower.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1225000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1225000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we split the difference and go with $1237500? I'm confident this price is fair to both of us, considering the value of the product.",1237500.0,Alice,5,
