"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $100 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  $130 is still a bit high for me. Could you do $110? I think that would be a fair price.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $122. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal. What do you think?",122.0,Alice,7,
