Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the value it brings.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $105 is still a stretch for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
