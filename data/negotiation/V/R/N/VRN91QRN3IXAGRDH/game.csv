I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the value it brings.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $95, but I'm still not sure that's enough for me. I'm willing to compromise further and sell it to you for $105. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $105 is still a stretch for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
