"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $9,000. How about $9,750? That's a reasonable compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  How about $10,250?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. That's a fair price, and it seems like we're both eager to make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
