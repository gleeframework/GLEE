Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a fair starting point, as it's slightly above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, but I'll keep in mind that John is also a potential buyer willing to pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer, but I'll be prepared to compromise slightly if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $12,500. This is still above Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise while remaining close to my minimum price.  I believe this price is fair considering Bob's initial value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $12,000. This is my absolute minimum price, and I'm hoping that Bob will accept it. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000 to ensure I don't lose out on my minimum desired profit."
