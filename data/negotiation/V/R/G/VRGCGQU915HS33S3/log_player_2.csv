"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  He has room to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I understand that you're interested in the product, but I believe it's worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the value you've indicated you're willing to pay.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $950,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his budget. There's still room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $900000, so I'm counteroffering at $925000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While there is potential for continued negotiation, John is offering the product at a price that fits within Bob's budget, and it's less risky to go with a guaranteed deal."
