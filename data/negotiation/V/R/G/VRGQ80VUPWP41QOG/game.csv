"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still can't reach that amount within my budget. Could you possibly lower it to $8,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
