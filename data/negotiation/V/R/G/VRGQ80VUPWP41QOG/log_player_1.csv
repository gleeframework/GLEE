Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, knowing Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to find a compromise, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **John as a Backup:**  I have John as a safety net, which allows me to be more assertive in negotiations, knowing I have a guaranteed $8,000 if things fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can get more.  
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** I can still potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **John as a Backup:** Even if I don't get a better offer from Bob, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm not accepting Bob's initial offer, but I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to his price point.
* **Compromise:** Offering $9,000 is a clear compromise and shows a willingness to find a solution.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, making it more appealing to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still can't reach that amount within my budget. Could you possibly lower it to $8,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Further Negotiation is Unlikely:**  It's unlikely Bob will go higher, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **John's Offer:** While I could sell to John for $8,000, getting $500 more from Bob is a good outcome.

I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a sale and maximize my profit."
