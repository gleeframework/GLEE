"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This product is truly exceptional and will bring you significant value.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of your product, but I have a budget in mind. I could consider going up to $12,000, but that's my limit.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the value of my product. While $12,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for something a bit closer to $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This price reflects the exceptional quality and potential benefits this product offers. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $12,500? That's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  To show my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows you to get the exceptional value of this product while ensuring I receive a reasonable price.  Let's close this deal!",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with. To be honest, I've found similar products for less, and I need to be mindful of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $12,250, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",12250.0,Bob,8,
