Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $13,500 is cutting it very close to my bottom line, but I value closing this deal with you. How about we settle at $14,250? This is my final offer, as I need to move forward with other potential buyers soon."", ""product_price"": 14250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, his final offer of $13,000 is still too far from my $14,250. It's unlikely he'll budge significantly, and I risk getting a lower offer in the next rounds. It's more strategic at this point to take John's guaranteed $12,000 and avoid further negotiation."
