"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $13,500 is cutting it very close to my bottom line, but I value closing this deal with you. How about we settle at $14,250? This is my final offer, as I need to move forward with other potential buyers soon.",14250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon.",13000.0,Bob,6,
