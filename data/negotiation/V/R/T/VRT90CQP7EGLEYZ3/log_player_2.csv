"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you the product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $140
* **Your Value:** $150
* **John's Price:** $150

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially try to negotiate further with Alice, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price isn't worth it in this scenario."
