"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for the product. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is too low for me.  This product is really valuable, and I'm confident it's worth much more. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we try $9,500? That's a fair offer considering its actual value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $9,500 is still quite a way from what I had in mind. This product is top-notch and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment. How about we settle at $12,500?  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for clarifying. $12,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000.  That's my best and final offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has made it clear that $10,000 is his absolute limit.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get him much higher, and we risk him walking away entirely. Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and avoids further negotiation."
