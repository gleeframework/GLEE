"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for the product. Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is too low for me.  This product is really valuable, and I'm confident it's worth much more. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we try $9,500? That's a fair offer considering its actual value.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $9,500 is still quite a way from what I had in mind. This product is top-notch and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment. How about we settle at $12,500?  This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for clarifying. $12,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000.  That's my best and final offer.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,6,
