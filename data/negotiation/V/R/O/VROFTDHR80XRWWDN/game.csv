"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900000 to make this deal work. This is still a good price for you, and it leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $875000 is still not a price that works for me.  I'm willing to come down to $890000 as a final compromise.  This is a significant price reduction, and I truly believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",890000.0,Alice,5,
