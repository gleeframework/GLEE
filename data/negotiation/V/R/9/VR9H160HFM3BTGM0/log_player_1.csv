Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, close to the value to Bob, to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $950,000 leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I get a price significantly higher than my minimum. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes that I'm open to discussion and willing to find a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a good price! 
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll consider his counteroffer, aiming to stay above my minimum of $800,000.
* **Stalemate:** If negotiations stall, I can always fall back on John's $800,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $850,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob acknowledges the value of the product and is willing to negotiate. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** I believe I can still get a better price by making a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my original offer. 
* **Maintain Pressure:**  I'll try to emphasize the value of the product and the potential loss for Bob if he misses out. 
* **Backup Plan:** If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant gain for you. This is my final offer, let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a compromise by coming down from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profitable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, making him aware of the potential missed opportunity if he doesn't accept.
* **Final Offer:**  I'm framing this as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a good price!
* **Bob Rejects:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I have two options: 
    * **Sell to John:** I can take the guaranteed $800,000 from John.
    * **Final Counteroffer:** I can make one last counteroffer, aiming for a price slightly higher than $800,000, but only if I'm confident Bob is genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $890,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:**  $890,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for Loss:**  If I reject this offer and Bob walks away, I risk having to sell to John for $800,000, making no additional profit from my initial negotiation.
* **Time is a Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could prolong the process and potentially lead to a worse outcome.  Accepting now guarantees a sale and a decent profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalizing the Deal:** I'll move forward with the sale to Bob for $890,000, ensuring all details are finalized and the transaction completed."
