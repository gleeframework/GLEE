"I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a fair price for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant gain for you. This is my final offer, let me know your decision.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $890,000",890000.0,Bob,4,
