"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm prepared to pay. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. Would you be willing to consider $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still quite large. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, but I need to see a more significant move on your end. Would you be willing to consider $1,750,000? This reflects the true value of what I'm offering while acknowledging your willingness to engage in good faith.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
