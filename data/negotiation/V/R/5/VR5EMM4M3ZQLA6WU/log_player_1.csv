Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. It's a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum. I'll see if Bob's interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally get closer to my initial asking price, $85 is still a good profit margin. It's also a reasonable compromise, and further negotiation might risk losing the sale altogether."
