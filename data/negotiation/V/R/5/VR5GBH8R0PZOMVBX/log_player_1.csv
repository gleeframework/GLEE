"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's below Bob's perceived value but above my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation without risking losing the deal immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my goal of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering with $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still pushing for a better price."
