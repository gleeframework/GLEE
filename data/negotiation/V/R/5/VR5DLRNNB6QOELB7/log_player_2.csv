"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $950,000 is still a significant amount above your target price.
* **Rejecting gives you leverage.** By rejecting, you signal that you're not willing to pay that much. This opens the door for negotiation and potentially a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback.**  While John's offer is higher, it's a safety net if you can't get a better deal with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? This would give us both a fair deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your target, $900,000 is still above what you're comfortable paying.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** You've shown that you're willing to negotiate and Alice has signaled a willingness to compromise. This means there's likely still room to reach a lower price.
* **John's offer remains a safety net.** If negotiations fall apart, you have a backup option, so you can afford to be firm in your stance."
