"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always worth trying to negotiate. Since Alice's offer is your maximum, there's no harm in trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  A counteroffer of $1,000,000 represents a significant discount, giving Alice some room to negotiate while still offering you a substantial savings. This approach is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still quite high. It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to push for a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, giving us ample time to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair compromise and allows us to both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer represents a smaller step than before, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. It's a good balance between being firm in your goal and leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go up to $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1080000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has made a significant concession by dropping her price to $1,080,000. This is a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum price is $1,200,000.  While there is potential to negotiate further, accepting the offer guarantees a purchase at a good price with a significant discount.  With 5 rounds remaining, there's a risk that Alice may not be willing to go lower, and Bob could potentially end up paying more if he continues to negotiate. It's better to secure the deal at this point."
