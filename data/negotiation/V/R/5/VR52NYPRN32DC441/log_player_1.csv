Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $8,000 is my minimum, but I believe I can get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $9,500? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred to get closer to $10,000, it's getting late in the negotiation and  $9,000 is still a good deal for me.  I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle for John's offer of $8,000."
