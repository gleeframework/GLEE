Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I believe it's of great value and you'll be very satisfied with it."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $100, so aiming for a price close to that maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down slightly, making him feel like he's getting a deal, while still ensuring Alice gets a price above her minimum. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $80 gives Alice a safety net. She doesn't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob."
