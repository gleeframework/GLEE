``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It signals my willingness to compromise, but also demonstrates the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a low price. I'll counter with a higher offer, hoping to find a price point we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. How about $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking to get a fair price, and I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? It's a strong offer, and it would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, it's a good deal considering Bob's initial offer and the risk of further negotiation.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 would be ideal, but I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
