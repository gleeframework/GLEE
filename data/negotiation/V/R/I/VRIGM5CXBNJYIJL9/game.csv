"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more realistic price. How about $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,250,000 is still a big leap for me.  I could consider something closer to $700,000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product right now. What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Think about it carefully; this might be our last chance to close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
