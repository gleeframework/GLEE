Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Think about it carefully; this might be our last chance to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll reach a price close enough to John's offer of $800,000 within the remaining rounds. She's still significantly over, and her latest message implies a firm stance. Cutting losses and securing the product from John at the known price is the safest and most financially sound decision at this point."
