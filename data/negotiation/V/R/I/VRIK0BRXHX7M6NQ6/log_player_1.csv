Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, as I'm confident in the value of my product. If Bob rejects, I'll then consider his counteroffer and potentially negotiate further. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the deal with Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm willing to compromise a little, but I'm still confident in the value of my product. This offer is a midpoint between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. If Bob accepts, I'll be able to secure a reasonable profit. If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John, as I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on the sale entirely.  While it's not my ideal price, $920,000 is a good outcome for me."
