Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

This offer starts with a high price, above the product's value to Bob, but still lower than the alternative price from John.  This allows for negotiation space while still securing a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer but represents a significant concession from my initial offer. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum desired value, as continued negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a higher price."
