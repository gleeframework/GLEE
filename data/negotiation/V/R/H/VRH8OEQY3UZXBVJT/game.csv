"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I can't go above $850,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective.  To be frank,  $850,000 is quite a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle?  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
