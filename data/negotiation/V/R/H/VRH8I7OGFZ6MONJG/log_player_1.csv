I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $90 is still below my minimum, and I have more rounds to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $85 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $92.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal on a fantastic product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  I've reached the point where Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum price, and I'm not confident I can get him to meet my desired price.  It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than risk losing out on a better deal by continuing with Bob."
