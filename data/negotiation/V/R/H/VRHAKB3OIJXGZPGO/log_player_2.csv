Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth more to me than $20,000, but I'm willing to pay a premium for it. However, I'd like to negotiate a price that's more in line with my budget.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $18,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'm still not convinced that $18,000 is a good deal for me. I've already made a counteroffer of $12,000, and Alice's new offer is still $6,000 above that. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better price.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.
