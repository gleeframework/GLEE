"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I'm confident this product will yield far greater returns for you in the long run. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
