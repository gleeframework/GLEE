Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a high starting point, but it allows me to maximize potential profit. 
* **Understanding the Situation:** I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I need to be cautious.  This initial offer acts as a test. 
* **The Alternative:** If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000.  This gives me some leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll analyze Bob's response (accept or reject) and his potential counteroffer. 
* **Strategic Adjustments:** Based on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy. This could involve lowering my price slightly, standing firm, or even stopping the negotiation and selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Lowball:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my desired price and is equal to the value John is offering.  This is a clear attempt to get a bargain.
* **The Negotiation Continues:**  While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, I haven't reached a point where I'm willing to accept it.  There's still room for negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a possibility that I can secure a better price from Bob through further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will create a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Assessing Risk:**  I'll need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to lower my price based on my assessment of Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **The Time Factor:** I'll also need to consider how long I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob.  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more likely I am to accept a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,500,000 to $1,250,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it signals that I'm open to negotiation. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  By offering $1,250,000, I'm maintaining a margin above the value John is offering, which gives me some leverage.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll analyze Bob's response (accept, reject, or counteroffer) carefully. 
* **Flexibility and Adaptability:**  Based on Bob's response, I'll be prepared to adjust my strategy. This could involve further lowering my price (if necessary) or potentially holding firm at this price if I believe Bob values the product closer to this amount.
* **Managing Time:**  I'll continue to assess how long I'm willing to negotiate with Bob. I need to balance the potential for a better price with the risk of the negotiation dragging on unnecessarily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Lowball:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my desired price and is below John's offer. This shows that Bob is not willing to meet my expectations.
* **No Room for Compromise:**  It's unlikely that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a better price. His counteroffers are consistently lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Secure the Minimum:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees me a safe and acceptable profit.  It's not ideal, but it's better than potentially wasting more time with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Sell to John:**  I will accept John's offer and conclude the sale. This ensures a quick and reliable transaction without further negotiation.
* **Lessons Learned:** I've learned that Bob is not a suitable buyer for this product, as he undervalues it. This experience will help me adjust my future negotiations."
