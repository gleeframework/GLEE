Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer allows you to assess how eager Bob is to purchase the product and provides insights into his perceived value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes your willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in a back-and-forth.

This strategy allows you to gather information about Bob's position before potentially lowering your asking price. Remember, your backup offer from John guarantees you at least $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both your initial asking price and Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,200,000).  There's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal. 

You are willing to walk away with $800,000 from John, so you have a strong bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your desire to find a good deal.  While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price.  Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your last offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a strong price.
* **Justifying the Price:** You reiterate the product's value as a subtle reminder to Bob that he stands to gain significantly. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer gauges Bob's flexibility and helps determine if a deal closer to your desired range is achievable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is a strong deal for you:

* **Significant Profit:** You are securing a profit of $225,000 above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Negotiating Position:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk alienating Bob or result in only marginally higher offers. 

Accepting this offer locks in a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds."
