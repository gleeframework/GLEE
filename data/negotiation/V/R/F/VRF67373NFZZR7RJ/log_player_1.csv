{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $150. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will be interested in the product and will be willing to pay a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}

I'm counteroffering at $190. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise a bit.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $180 is now very close to my desired price point. Accepting this offer will still result in a good profit for me, and I'm happy to close the deal."
