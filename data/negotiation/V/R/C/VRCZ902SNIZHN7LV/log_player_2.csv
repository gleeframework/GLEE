"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $90.
* You can get it from John for $100.

Since you can get the product for the same price from John, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice. It allows you to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or simply go with John's offer."
