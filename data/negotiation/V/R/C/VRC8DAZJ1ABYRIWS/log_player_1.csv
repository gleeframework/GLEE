Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $12,000 but leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counter if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $13,500? That's still a great price for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,500 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $14,500. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $13,500 is a good starting point, but I'm willing to come down a bit to $14,000. That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway with my counteroffer.  $14,000 is still a good profit for me, but it's a compromise that shows I'm serious about closing the deal.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle. How about $13,750?  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer $14,000, $13,750 is still a good price, and it's a fair compromise. I'm also worried that if I reject his offer again, he might walk away entirely, and then I'd be stuck with John's offer of $12,000. It's better to lock in a good deal now than risk getting a worse one later."
