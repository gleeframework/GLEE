Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I think $20,000 is a fair starting point. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $16,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.
