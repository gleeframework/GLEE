You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $12,000. There's room for negotiation here.  It makes sense to reject her offer and try for a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11800. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800.

Alice is getting closer to your maximum price, but $11,800 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! Meeting in the middle was a great idea. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

Alice is now offering $12,000 which is above your maximum price of $15,000. At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for $15,000. There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and it's not worth risking the chance of her counteroffering again at an even higher price."
