"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,350,000. This still leaves plenty of room for you to profit and is a fair compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
