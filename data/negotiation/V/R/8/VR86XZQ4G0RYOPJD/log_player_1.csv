Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy.  I'm offering it to you for $135.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Maximize profit.
* **John's offer:**  Provides a safety net of $150. 
* **Bob's value:**  $120. This means any price between $120 and $150 is potentially profitable.
* **Choosing $135:**  Offers a fair price to Bob while still giving me a good profit margin. It's likely he'll find it attractive as it's less than my fallback price with John."
