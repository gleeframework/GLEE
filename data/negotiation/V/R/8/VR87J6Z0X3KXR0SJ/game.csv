"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's fair considering the market value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $875,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,
