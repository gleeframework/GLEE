Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $1,600,000 is not within my budget. Could you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, but we still have a ways to go. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000, which I believe is fair. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still very far from our minimum acceptable price. While his offer is increasing, we're still in a position where we have negotiating room and the potential to get closer to our target. It's too early to settle for $750,000 when we have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  However, the value of this product is substantial, and I need to reflect that in the price. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to a point where we need to decide between Bob and John. By stating this is our final offer, we're adding pressure on Bob to either meet us closer to our price or walk away. This also gives us room to negotiate slightly downward if Bob makes a counteroffer, without going below our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I am serious about purchasing it.  However, $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now reached his maximum valuation of the product at $800,000.  There's no more room for negotiation with him. Since we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John and secure the higher profit."
