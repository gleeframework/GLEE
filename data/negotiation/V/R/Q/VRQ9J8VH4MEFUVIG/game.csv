"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price? I am willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I still feel that $1,750,000 is slightly beyond my current budget. Could we possibly meet closer to my maximum offer of $1,500,000? Perhaps $1,600,000 would be a fair compromise?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
