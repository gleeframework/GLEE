Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still trying to get as close to the product's value as possible. I'll counter with $8,250, which is the midpoint between your previous offer and my target price. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $8,000. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $8,500, he's consistently moving towards a middle ground. Accepting now at $8,250 is a reasonable compromise and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further or the negotiation stalling completely."
