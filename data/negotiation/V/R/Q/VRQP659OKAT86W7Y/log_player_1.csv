Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception and justify the high initial price.
* **Fallback Option:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives me leverage. I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes I have some time and flexibility in the negotiation. If I need to sell quickly, I might lower the initial price.
* Bob's response to this initial offer will heavily influence my next move. I will need to adjust my approach based on his willingness to negotiate."
