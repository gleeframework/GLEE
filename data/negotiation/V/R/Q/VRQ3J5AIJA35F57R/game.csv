"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,700 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,100? It's a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.",9100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,800 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle again at $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
