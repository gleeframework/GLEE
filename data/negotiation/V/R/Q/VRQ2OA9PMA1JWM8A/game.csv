"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your position, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price is still fair considering the product's worth to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? ",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,125,000. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
