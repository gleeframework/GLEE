* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than anything Bob is offering.
* **Minimizing Losses:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks ending up with a lower price than John's offer, which is a much better outcome.

**Conclusion:** It's time to secure the best possible price and sell the product to John.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial goal of $1,000,000,  selling to John guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
