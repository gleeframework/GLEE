"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is more than his maximum budget of $15,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the initial price I was willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still over his maximum limit of $15,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,000 for the product. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $17,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. I'm confident you'll find the product's value to be worth it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is not willing to negotiate down to Bob's maximum price of $15,000, and it's unlikely she will in the remaining rounds.  It's better to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
