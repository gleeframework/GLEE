"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, it falls short of the true value and potential this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value in this product, and I respect your approach. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a significant discount while still reflecting the product's worth.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $975,000, but I'd like to propose $960,000 as a compromise. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget.",960000.0,Bob,6,
