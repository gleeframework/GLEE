Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $975,000, but I'd like to propose $960,000 as a compromise. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While holding out for a higher price is tempting, Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground. Accepting his offer of $960,000 is a good deal at this stage of the negotiation, netting a significant profit.  Delaying further carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through entirely."
