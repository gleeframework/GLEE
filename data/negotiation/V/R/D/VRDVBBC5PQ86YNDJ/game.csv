"I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $250 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. How about we meet in the middle at $200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",200.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can do $185, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",185.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle on this one. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $175 again? I know you've seen this price before, but I'm willing to revisit it.",175.0,Alice,9,
