"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $120. Since you have the option to purchase from John, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and go with John."
