Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant premium to get the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500.  This is still a good deal for Bob since it's less than what he's willing to pay. However, it's also closer to my target price.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise."

Bob's offer is getting lower, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to risk getting a worse price than what John is offering.  It's time to move on and sell to John."
