"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives us room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit above my minimum threshold of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my target price. This still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push Bob a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm continuing to raise the price slightly with each counteroffer. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price, and hopefully encourages him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had 5 rounds with Bob and we're not making much progress. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below what I'd like to get. With only 4 rounds remaining, it's not worth risking a deal with Bob failing to meet my expectations. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and allows me to secure a deal quickly."
