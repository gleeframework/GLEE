"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance he can get a better deal with Alice, or at least get closer to his $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer of $11,000, but it still allows for some potential profit for Alice. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and Bob is likely to be willing to go slightly higher if Alice is close to accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $10,000, Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob another chance to try and get closer to his $8,000 target.  There's always a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, especially if she wants to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now increasing his offer slightly to $9,500. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise. It's also a good middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer, making it a more appealing option for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has only lowered her price by $500 from her previous offer. Bob is still aiming for a lower price and believes he can get closer to his target. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.  There's still a chance that Alice might be more willing to compromise if Bob holds firm."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again to $9,750. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise.  He is also getting closer to the middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's last offer. It's likely that Alice will be more open to negotiating at this point, especially if she wants to close the deal quickly."
