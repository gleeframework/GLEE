"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This will give me room to negotiate and test Bob's interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I could go with John now and secure $800,000,  I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more favorable price.  There's still a chance I can get closer to my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will tempt Bob while still being closer to my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. It's tempting to take the $600,000, but I'm holding out for more.  There's still a chance I can get closer to my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but this time I'm getting closer to John's offer. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to meet me halfway and close the deal.  It's a risky move, as there are only a few rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my desired profit. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal. If it fails, I'll take John's offer.  There's still a chance for a better deal, but I don't want to risk losing out on the $800,000 entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

This is my final offer.  It's a significant compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and accept.  If he doesn't, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk losing out on the $800,000 from John.  It's time to secure the deal."
