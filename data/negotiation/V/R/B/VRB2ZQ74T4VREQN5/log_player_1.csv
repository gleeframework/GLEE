Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its true worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,100,000 offer is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) to give us bargaining space.
    * Still a substantial gain for us over our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Open Communication:** The message invites Bob to counter-offer, fostering a potential win-win scenario."
