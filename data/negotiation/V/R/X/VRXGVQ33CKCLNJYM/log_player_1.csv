Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value and suitability for Bob, hoping to create a positive impression.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price point allows for several rounds of counteroffers without me needing to drop below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Plan B:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
