"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant value it holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,100,000 is still above his maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a significant amount and reflects the value I see in it.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and I'm eager to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my strong desire to find a mutually agreeable deal.  What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, $1,000,000 is still above his maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice again before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm still interested in the product, but unfortunately, $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to offer $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product while still staying within my budget.  I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a way for us to make this work. However,  $900,000 is still significantly below its true value. I'm willing to make one final offer at $950,000. This represents a substantial concession on my part. I believe it's a fair compromise that allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John at a price he can afford."
