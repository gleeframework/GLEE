{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $80, but leaves some room for negotiation. It also allows me to potentially make a profit while still leaving a possibility for Bob to make a counteroffer.  I'm willing to go down to $120 in a worst case scenario, but I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $85 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price this low. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $95?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I can only afford to pay up to $90 for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $120 I need to make it worth my while. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't accept an offer that doesn't at least meet my minimum. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not able to go lower than $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal at $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
