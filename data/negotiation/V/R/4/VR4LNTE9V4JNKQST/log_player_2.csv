"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your desired price range.**  You want to pay no more than $15,000 and Alice is asking for $12,000. 
* **You have room to negotiate.** You have 10 rounds, giving you ample opportunity to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.** If you can't get a lower price from Alice, you can always purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high.** You are trying to get below $11,000, and Alice is offering $11,500. 
* **You have more room to negotiate.** You still have 7 rounds left, allowing for more back and forth.
* **Buying from John is always an option.** This gives you a fallback if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This seems like a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $12,500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your limit but is still above your ideal price.** You're aiming for under $11,000, and she's offering $12,500.
* **You still have time to negotiate.** You have 5 rounds left, so there's still a chance you can get a better deal.
* **Buying from John is a strong option.** If you can't get a lower price from Alice, buying from John is a safe bet. However, you still want to explore whether you can get a better deal.

**Strategy:**  Since you have time and you're close to your price limit, it's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. While $12,500 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair compromise that shows we both want to find a solution. Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've given you a good deal, Bob, and I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I need to get a bit more for the product. I can offer it to you for $12,250, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting close, but still above your preferred price.** You're aiming for under $11,000, and she's offering $12,250. 
* **You're running out of time.** You only have 3 rounds left, and there's a risk of not reaching a deal.
* **Buying from John is the safest option.** While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee, and you risk wasting time and potentially ending up paying more than John's price.

**The risk of continuing with Alice is high.** You're close to your price limit, and it's unlikely Alice will budge much further.  It's more prudent to buy from John and ensure you get the product within your budget."
