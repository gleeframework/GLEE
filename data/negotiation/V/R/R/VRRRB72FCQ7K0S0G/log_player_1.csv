"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $110? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $110, which would be $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $105 is a good price and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he may walk away, or I may not be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds."
