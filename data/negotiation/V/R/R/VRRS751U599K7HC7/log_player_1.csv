Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think would be of great interest to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $15,000, which is above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I explicitly state that I'm open to negotiation. This encourages Bob to engage and make a counteroffer. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""unique"" nature of the product, hinting at potential value to Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-counteroffer. 
* I'll keep in mind that I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $10,000, which serves as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate. I'm willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Negotiation:** Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's still a sign that he's interested. I'm going to counter-offer, hoping to get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware John is willing to pay $10,000, but I believe I can get more from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price higher than $10,000. I'll likely aim for something between $10,000 and $15,000, depending on how determined I feel about getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $15,000 was a bit high. How about we split the difference? Would you consider $12,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price higher than my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a ""good deal"" for him, implying the product's worth.
* **Fair Profit:** I'm subtly highlighting the need to make a ""fair profit"" to justify my counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* Depending on Bob's response, I'll either accept his offer (if it's close to $12,500) or prepare another counteroffer, potentially lowering my price slightly but staying above $10,000. 
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm hopeful of getting a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, there's a chance that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, which could be better spent pursuing other potential buyers or focusing on other tasks.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This ensures I get a good price for the product and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a drawn-out process."
