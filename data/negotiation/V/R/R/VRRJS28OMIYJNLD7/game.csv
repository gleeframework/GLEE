"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than what I'm able to spend.  I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider a price of $850,000? I believe this would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Would you consider purchasing the product for $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about $950,000? I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe this price is fair and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. Would you consider purchasing the product for $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
