You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still a significant amount.  There's room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will likely push her to counter, but it establishes a lower price point and shows my seriousness in negotiating. I'm confident I can still secure a good deal, but this aggressive approach could lead to a faster agreement or force Alice to consider a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than my initial counteroffer. I believe I can still push for a better price by continuing to negotiate. I want to see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  However, it's still significantly below Alice's offer, pushing her to meet me halfway.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $820,000 is getting closer to my desired price point. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice walking away or me running out of rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a price significantly less than John's offer and allows me to secure the deal within my budget."
