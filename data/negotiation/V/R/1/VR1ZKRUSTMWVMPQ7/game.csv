"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. While I value your offer,  $1200000 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1350000 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1150000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $1150000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference one last time. I'm willing to accept $1250000 for the product. This price is fair given the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
