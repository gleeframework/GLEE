"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High, but Reasonable:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The message is framed as an ""initial proposal"" and invites Bob's response, allowing us to understand his eagerness and potential counter-offer.
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping the John offer ($1,000,000) in mind provides a safety net. We won't accept anything significantly lower than our desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,150,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000 is our absolute floor, but we're aiming for more). We have room to negotiate, and John's offer acts as a safety net. It's worth seeing if we can nudge Bob closer to our target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  While I recognize your offer, the product's value is firmly above that range. Would you be open to a price of $1,120,000? I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are reducing our price, but not drastically. This shows flexibility while reinforcing the product's value. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Aiming for a price roughly halfway between Bob's offer ($1,050,000) and our previous ask ($1,150,000) is a common negotiation tactic.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone remains collaborative, inviting Bob to continue the conversation and potentially counter again. 
* **Safety Net:** We are still comfortably above John's $1,000,000 offer, giving us room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,120,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,050,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and my financial constraints. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking Point:** Bob is signaling that $1,050,000 might be his top price. We need to decide if we're willing to accept a smaller profit or risk pushing him away.
* **Time Factor:**  We have six rounds remaining. It's becoming riskier to continue declining offers close to our minimum. 
* **Next Move is Crucial:** Our next counteroffer should signal whether we're willing to go lower or if we're prepared to walk away and sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and respect your firm stance. I've tried to find a middle ground that works for both of us. Given the circumstances, I'm willing to accept $1,080,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal considering its value and my own constraints."",
""product_price"": 1080000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and signal we're serious about the negotiation's end. 
* **Small Concession:**  We're moving closer to Bob's offer ($1,050,000) but still maintain a profit above our absolute minimum. 
* **Justification:** We're re-emphasizing the product's value while subtly mentioning our own ""constraints"" to make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Risk Assessment:** We're risking Bob rejecting this offer and potentially losing him as a buyer. However, we've shown flexibility, and this offer is strong enough to be appealing while still meeting our needs."
