"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  While I recognize your offer, the product's value is firmly above that range. Would you be open to a price of $1,120,000? I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,120,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,050,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and my financial constraints. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
