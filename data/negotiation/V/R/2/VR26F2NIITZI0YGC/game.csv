"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $17000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $18500? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",18500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your asking price, but $18500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $17500. This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",17500.0,Bob,4,
