"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really value. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a better price.  Since your goal is to save money, rejecting the first offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $115 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  That way we both get a good deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Even though Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You're still willing to pay less than $122.50, so rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a good deal, but $122.50 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  If you can meet me there, we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
