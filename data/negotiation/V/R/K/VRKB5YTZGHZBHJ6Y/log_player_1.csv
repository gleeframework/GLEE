Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $750,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $750,000 is too low, but I want to see if I can negotiate a bit more with Bob before selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $850,000?  This is still a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
