"I'm interested in the product, but $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I believe this product holds, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider $1,900,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's true worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to pay for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
