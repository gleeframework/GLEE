# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,200,000  to begin our conversation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I believe this product holds, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider $1,900,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's true worth.
