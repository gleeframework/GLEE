"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
