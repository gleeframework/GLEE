,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $140. If you're not willing to go that low, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145, but that's my final offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",145.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as 145. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 155 and 145, which would be 150. This is my final offer, so I hope you can consider it.",150.0,Alice,7,
