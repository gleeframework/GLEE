{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also provides a reason for Bob to consider the offer by highlighting the product's potential value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it is still lower than my minimum. It is important to remember that this product is worth at least $100 to me.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $110? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my desired price range. Accepting this offer would be a good compromise and allow me to make a decent profit.  It's also important to remember that further negotiation could risk losing Bob entirely and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
