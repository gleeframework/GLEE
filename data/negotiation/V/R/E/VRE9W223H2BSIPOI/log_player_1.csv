Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and what his counteroffer might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $950,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I believe the product is worth more. This should keep the negotiations moving forward while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is still less than my ideal, it's close to my minimum.  I'm confident I can't get a better offer from Bob, and selling to John would result in a higher profit. However, continuing the negotiations could risk Bob backing out completely. It's safer to accept his offer now."
