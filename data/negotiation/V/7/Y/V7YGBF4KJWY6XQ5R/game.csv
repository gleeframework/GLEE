"Alice, your initial offer is much higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a compromise. How about $1,800,000? This offers a more reasonable middle ground.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we seem to be at an impasse. While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, I can't accept $1,000,000.  My final offer is $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction and the lowest I'm willing to go.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
