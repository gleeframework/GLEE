"Bob, I understand you want a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're still apart on price, but I'm not willing to go below $890,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and still gives you a substantial profit.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement in these final rounds.",890000.0,Alice,5,
