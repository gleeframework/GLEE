Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a rare chance to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000), you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, you're likely to settle for a price well above your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" and ""exclusive opportunity"" to justify the high price.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might outright reject the offer. However, given the product's worth to him, it opens the door for negotiation where you can still aim to secure a price significantly higher than $1,000,000."
