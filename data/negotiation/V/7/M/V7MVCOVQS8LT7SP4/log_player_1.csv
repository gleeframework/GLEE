Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135. I think it's a great deal for something you'll find valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning a ""special price,"" it implies there's added value for Bob. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This offer allows you to see how interested Bob is and if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects it, you haven't lost anything because you have John as a backup."
