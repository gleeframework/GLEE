Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $18,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach our minimum of $15,000.  We have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed profit now rather than risk Bob not reaching an acceptable price in the remaining rounds."
