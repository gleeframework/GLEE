"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too low for me. This product is truly unique and valuable.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $18,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
