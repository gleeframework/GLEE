"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd need a more reasonable price. How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $800,000 is a bit low, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the value of the product to you, and it's still a significant opportunity.  Let's find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still too wide.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000.  This is a fair offer considering its potential value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still significantly less than what this product is worth. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it for $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering both our perspectives, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're making progress, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to drop to $1,250,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and reflects the value you've placed on the product. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
