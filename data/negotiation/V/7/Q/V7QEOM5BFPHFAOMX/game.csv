"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10500 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $10500 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $10250? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10250.0,Bob,4,
