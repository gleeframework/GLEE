"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get an amazing product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
