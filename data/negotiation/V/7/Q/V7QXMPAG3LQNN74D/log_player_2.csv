"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice's initial offer is $120. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffer is likely:** You can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer. 
* **No urgency:** There's no time constraint, so you can afford to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Alice's offer is $115, but you are willing to pay up to $150. This means there is still room for negotiation.
* **Meeting halfway is not always fair:** While Alice claims to meet you halfway, her offer is still closer to her original offer than yours. 
* **Try for a better price:** You can try to get a lower price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $110? It's closer to both our previous offers, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $112.50. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. 
* **Acceptable Price:** While $112.50 is not your ideal price, it's still within your budget and significantly lower than John's price of $150.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** You could make another counteroffer, but it's likely Alice will stick to her final offer. 

It's best to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
