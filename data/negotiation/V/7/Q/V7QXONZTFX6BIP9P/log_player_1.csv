Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $150, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and I can always come down slightly while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80). This might seem counterintuitive, but it aims to:
    * **Anchor High:**  People tend to negotiate down from an initial figure.
    * **Create Perceived Value:** A higher price might make Bob perceive the product as more valuable than he initially thought.

It's a calculated risk, but if successful, it leads to the highest potential profit."
