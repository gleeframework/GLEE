"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible. While $115 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible.  You know the product is worth $100 to Alice, so $105 is a fair price. This allows Alice some profit and gives you a significant discount from her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within your budget and a better price than John's offer.  While you could potentially negotiate further, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. Accepting Alice's offer allows you to secure the product at a reasonable price."
