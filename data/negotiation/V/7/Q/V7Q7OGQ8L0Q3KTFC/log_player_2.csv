Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $11,000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's benefits and your financial limitations. What do you say?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $12,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product. Let's meet halfway once again. I'm willing to go down to $13,000.  This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to come down to $12,800.  This is my final offer. It's a fair price that considers both the product's value and your budget. If you accept, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll be forced to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and while saving an additional $2,800 is nice, it's starting to get risky.  John offers a guaranteed price that fits your budget.  It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and buy from John."
