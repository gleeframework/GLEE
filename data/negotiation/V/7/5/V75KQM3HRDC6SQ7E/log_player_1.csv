Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny of $95. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** It's crucial to price it above the $80 you're guaranteed from John to ensure you're maximizing potential profit. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while still leaving you with a guaranteed sale option if he declines."
