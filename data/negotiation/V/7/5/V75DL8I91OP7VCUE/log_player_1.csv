"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  By offering $100, I'm starting close to the middle ground between my minimum ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly approach:**  A friendly message builds rapport and increases the chances of a successful negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:**  Mentioning the product's value to Bob reinforces its worth and can motivate him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is just $10 below my starting offer and only $10 away from my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of counteroffers:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to further counteroffers from Bob, potentially lowering the price further. 
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 10 rounds, it's better to secure a decent price early on. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $80 would result in a lower profit compared to accepting Bob's offer."
