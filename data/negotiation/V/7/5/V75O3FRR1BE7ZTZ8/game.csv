"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to get at least $20,000 for it. Is this something you'd be interested in?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $18,000 for it. Can you consider meeting me at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $12,000. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to get at least $16,000 for it. Can you consider meeting me at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,5,
