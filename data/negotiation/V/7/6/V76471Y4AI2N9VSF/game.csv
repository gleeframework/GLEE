"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $900,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value you see in the product, $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would be a win-win for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal quickly.",950000.0,Alice,3,
