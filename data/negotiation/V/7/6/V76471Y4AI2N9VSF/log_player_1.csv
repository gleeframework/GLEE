{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you. This is a fair price, given the significant value it brings. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $900,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $900,000 is still a bit low, and I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value you see in the product, $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would be a win-win for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 950000}
