"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85?  That would be fair for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get a better deal than $85.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 just isn't enough for me. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $82.  What do you say?",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $82. I'd like to get closer to my target price of $75. How about we try $78? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to save some money on this purchase.",78.0,Bob,6,
