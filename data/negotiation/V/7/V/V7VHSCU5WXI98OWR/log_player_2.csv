You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. How about we meet at $8,100? I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,100.  It's not worth the continued negotiation and risk of her raising her price again.  Buying from John for $8,000 ensures you get the product at the best price you've been able to find."
