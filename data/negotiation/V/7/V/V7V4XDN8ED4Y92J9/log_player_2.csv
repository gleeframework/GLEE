"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $10,000. I think it's a great deal, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save more money. He should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $10,500. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob.  He values the product at $12,000, and this offer saves him $1,500 compared to buying from John. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice completely is too high. Accepting this offer is the best strategy for maximizing savings while ensuring Bob gets the product."
