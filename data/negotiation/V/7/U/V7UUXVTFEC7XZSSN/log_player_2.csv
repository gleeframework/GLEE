Alice's offer is way too high.  It's time to counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is simply too high for me.  Given my understanding of the product's value and my budget, I'm prepared to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while also leaving room for both of us to benefit."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $850,000 is a significant distance from where I see the value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this reflects a more accurate valuation while still leaving room for you to see a substantial return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. It's important to continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,750,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute limit. I truly believe this product has great potential, but I need to stay within a reasonable price range. Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  I'm willing to make a significant move to bridge this, but it needs to be met with a comparable step from your side. I'll come down to $1,500,000, my absolute floor for this product.  This is a generous offer, and I need you to recognize the value proposition here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price that Bob can afford.  It's time to cut his losses and buy from John instead."
