"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true value and potential of what's on offer.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is simply too high for me.  Given my understanding of the product's value and my budget, I'm prepared to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while also leaving room for both of us to benefit.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $850,000 is a significant distance from where I see the value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this reflects a more accurate valuation while still leaving room for you to see a substantial return on your investment.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,750,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute limit. I truly believe this product has great potential, but I need to stay within a reasonable price range. Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  I'm willing to make a significant move to bridge this, but it needs to be met with a comparable step from your side. I'll come down to $1,500,000, my absolute floor for this product.  This is a generous offer, and I need you to recognize the value proposition here.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
