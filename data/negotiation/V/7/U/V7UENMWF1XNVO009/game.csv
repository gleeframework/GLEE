"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the potential of the product while still staying within my financial constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver a substantial return. To move towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while still remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this point.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
