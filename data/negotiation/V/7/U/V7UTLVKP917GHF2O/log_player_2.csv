# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'd like to make you a serious offer. I'm willing to part with this product for $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, I'm aiming to save as much money as possible. I'll try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $750,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a serious compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm offering it to you for $825000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While $825,000 is still more than my initial counteroffer, it's a good price considering the product's value and my limited time.  I'm confident I can get a good return on investment, even at this price.  It's also worth noting that if I reject this offer, I risk losing out on the deal altogether and having to buy from John at a higher price."
