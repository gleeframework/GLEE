"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your willingness to pay $750,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value it holds for you and the market demand.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer you $800,000, which is my absolute limit. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  ",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $800,000 is your limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up on the extra $25,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $815,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value and my original asking price.",815000.0,Alice,5,
