"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to you and allows me to make a decent profit.  Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product.  It's still a good deal for you, as you'd be making a profit, and it's a significant saving for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $9,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  It's still a great deal for you, and it'll allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit and me a significant savings.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
