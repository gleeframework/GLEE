"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product to me. However, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this point. I'm willing to offer $11500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's still above your stated value of $12000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,2,
