Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly lower than Bob's maximum allows for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Consider the Alternative:** Alice has a guaranteed offer of $800,000 from John, so the offer to Bob must be significantly more attractive.

This strategy aims to achieve the best possible outcome for Alice while being reasonable enough to entice Bob to accept."
