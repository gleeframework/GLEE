Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a higher offer ($1,500,000) sets an anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, there's always a risk Bob could reject the offer. This strategy aims to maximize your profit potential, but a slightly lower offer could increase the chance of securing the deal with Bob."
