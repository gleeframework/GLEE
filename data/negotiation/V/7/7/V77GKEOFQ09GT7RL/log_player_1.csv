{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it.  I'm asking for $175 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the initial price at $175. This is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my offer.  

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a higher price initially to maximize my profit potential. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down slightly, but I won't go below $150 (my minimum).
* If negotiations stall, I have the option of selling to John for $150, guaranteeing me a profit."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  That price is a little high for me though. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $125?  It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $125, which is halfway between my previous offer of $175 and Bob's offer of $80. This shows willingness to negotiate but still maintains a decent profit margin for me.
* **Message:** I'm being polite and emphasizing the value of the product while reaffirming my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.  

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a middle ground to see if Bob is willing to compromise. 
* If he still refuses, I can consider moving closer to his price point or accepting John's offer."
