"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 to start the conversation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the recommendation. I believe I can offer you $150 for it, which I think is a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the absolute maximum he's willing to pay.  There's no room for negotiation upwards. Accepting his offer gets me $150, but John will also pay $150. Since there's no potential to earn more from Bob, it's strategically better to sell to John and avoid further negotiation rounds."
