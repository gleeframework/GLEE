"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a significant amount considering its value to me.  Let's start with this offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let's try to work together to close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach a deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can find a way to reach an agreement.  If not, I'll need to seriously consider other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
