**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging significantly in her offers. While she might come down a bit more, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's $8,000 offer. At this point, it's more strategic to cut our losses and buy from John to guarantee we get the product without risking a higher price in the remaining rounds."
