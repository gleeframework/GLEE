Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I am willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I can still try to negotiate a higher price. I have 8 more rounds and can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, so I hope you'll consider it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
