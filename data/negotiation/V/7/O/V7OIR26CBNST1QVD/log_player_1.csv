"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $95. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $90 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $87.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $87 is getting closer to my desired price, I think I can still push for a little more. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still higher than Bob's."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
