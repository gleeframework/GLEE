"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible, and $95 is still too high.  Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to make a counteroffer and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $90 for the product.  This is still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are still aiming to save as much as possible.  While $90 is better than Alice's initial offer, you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially close the deal for less than $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $90 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $87.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $88. This is a fair price that's good for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and Bob is getting the product for $8 less than he would pay from John.  It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal."
