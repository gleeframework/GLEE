"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $7,500 is good, Bob can likely get a better price. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  $7,500 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for 7250. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. Alice's offer of $7,250 is closer to Bob's target, but there is still room for negotiation. With 7 rounds left, Bob can continue to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,250 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a slightly better deal. Would you consider $7,100? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob! I understand your desire to get a good deal. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for 7200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear this is her final offer. While Bob could continue to negotiate, he is now at a point where he's only saving $800 by going with Alice's offer compared to buying from John.  There are still 5 rounds left, but the potential for saving more money is slim. It's likely Alice won't budge further, and Bob might end up with a worse price if he keeps rejecting. It's safer to take the deal and secure the product."
