"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is asking for $175. This is way too much, so I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $150 is still above what the product is worth to me, but it's closer to my maximum price point. I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and potential delays, especially since I know I can buy it for $100 from John if needed."
