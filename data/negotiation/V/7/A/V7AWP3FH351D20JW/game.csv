"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $13,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects its value while still offering you a fair deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
