Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly below its true worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000? This reflects its value while still offering you a considerable return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. We are aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000 and still have time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,100,000? This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber, and I believe it represents a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but we're still $50,000 away from our absolute minimum. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge that gap.  We're getting close to the point where John's offer might be more appealing, but we still have some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been a very persistent negotiator, and I respect that.  Let's close this deal.  I'm willing to accept $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as it's essential for me to receive a fair return on this unique product."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, we're getting very close to John's offer.  This counteroffer:

* **Presents a compromise:** It meets Bob more than halfway from the previous round.
* **Creates urgency:** By stating it's our final offer, we encourage Bob to accept now.
* **Maintains a profit margin:** We're still securing a profit above our $1,000,000 minimum.

If Bob rejects this offer, it's highly likely we'll accept John's deal in the next round to avoid the risk of a lower offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is my final offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet our minimum price.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll increase his offer substantially in the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum desired profit without further risk of losing the deal entirely."
