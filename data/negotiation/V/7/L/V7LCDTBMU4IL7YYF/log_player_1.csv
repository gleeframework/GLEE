Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I propose a price of $1,500,000. This is a rare chance to acquire something truly unique."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed buyer at that price. This allows you to aim significantly higher.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer of $1,500,000 sets an anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, you're likely to land well above your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""immense value and potential"" helps justify the high price, framing it as an investment rather than just a purchase.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable with a potential rejection from Bob. If you want to absolutely guarantee a sale, offering it at or slightly above $1,000,000 would be the safest approach."
