Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but represents a compromise from my initial asking price. I hope this will show good faith and encourage Bob to come up a little higher in his next counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my comfort zone. At this point, the negotiation is taking too long, and John is offering me a guaranteed sale at my minimum. I'm going to sell to John to avoid further delays and uncertainty."
