Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob doesn't accept the initial price. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to reject it. There's no reason to accept it when I can potentially get more by counter-offering. I'll see if I can push for a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value I place on the product, and it might be appealing to Bob as it's a significant step up from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is too low for me.  It's significantly less than my minimum value, and I'm not willing to risk getting a lower price if I counteroffer again.  I'm going to accept John's offer of $15,000 to ensure I at least get my minimum value for the product."
