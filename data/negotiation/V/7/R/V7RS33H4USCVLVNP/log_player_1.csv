"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is based on the assumption that Bob might be willing to pay more than $8,000 but I don't want to give it away too cheaply. It also leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds before adjusting my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,200 is better than my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $10,000. I'm going to try to meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm offering $9,600. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still value the product at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $8,800 is significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  I'm going to accept this offer to ensure I get a good price for the product."
