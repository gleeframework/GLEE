Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to someone in your position."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, meaning he has a potential profit of $2,000 if he buys at your minimum price ($8,000).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for the highest possible price within Bob's range of acceptable value is key.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $14,000 might seem tempting, starting at $13,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a final price closer to $14,000.
* **Backup Option:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, ensuring you don't lose money if Bob declines.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
