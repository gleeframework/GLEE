"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
