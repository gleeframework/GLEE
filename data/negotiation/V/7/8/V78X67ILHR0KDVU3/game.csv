"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the full potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, recognizing the significant benefits you'll gain from this product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair value for the product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
