**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground, but he's still a significant way off from my bottom line. I'm willing to push him a little further, but I need to hold firm to get a price closer to my target."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has made it clear that $950,000 is his absolute limit, and he's unlikely to budge.  While I could continue negotiating, the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of losing a guaranteed sale to John at my desired price.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the sure thing with John."
