"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's worth at least $1.5 million to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's still very attractive. Let's discuss a mutually beneficial deal.  I'm flexible, but I need to get at least $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
