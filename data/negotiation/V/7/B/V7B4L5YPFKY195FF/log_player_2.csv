"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $2000000. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. Bob should reject the offer and make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $2,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, given the value I place on it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer is now the same as John's offer, so Bob should accept it. This is the best deal Bob can get, as he has a clear alternative option."
