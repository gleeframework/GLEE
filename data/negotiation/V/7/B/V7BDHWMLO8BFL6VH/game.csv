"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $13,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it, considering it's a unique product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $13,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500 either. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
