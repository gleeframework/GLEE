"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $100
* **Your Value:** $120 
* **John's Price:** $120

Since Alice's offer is lower than what you're willing to pay (your value) and lower than John's price, accepting Alice's offer is the best option. It saves you money compared to buying from John."
