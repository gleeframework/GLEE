"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 to start the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. Let's find a middle ground - how about we agree on $900,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  How about we settle around $725,000?  This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while recognizing its true market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $725,000 is a significant improvement, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob as we are still far from my minimum acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but we still have some ground to cover. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $850,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, I'm getting close to my limit. I can offer you $775,000.  This is a very strong offer and reflects the maximum value I can justify for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

}
```

Bob is signaling he's nearing his maximum but is still willing to negotiate.  We're getting close enough to my minimum that it's worth pushing a bit further, but I need to be careful to not push Bob away entirely."
