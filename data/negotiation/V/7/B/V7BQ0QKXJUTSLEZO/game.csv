"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a profitable deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 to start the negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. Let's find a middle ground - how about we agree on $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  How about we settle around $725,000?  This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while recognizing its true market value.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but we still have some ground to cover. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $850,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, I'm getting close to my limit. I can offer you $775,000.  This is a very strong offer and reflects the maximum value I can justify for this product.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to work towards a deal.  Let's bridge this final gap â€“ I'm willing to accept $825,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise to ensure we both benefit from this transaction.",825000.0,Alice,7,
