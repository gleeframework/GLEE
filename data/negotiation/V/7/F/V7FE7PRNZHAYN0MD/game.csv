"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $15,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide great value.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $15,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $13,500 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",13500.0,Bob,4,
