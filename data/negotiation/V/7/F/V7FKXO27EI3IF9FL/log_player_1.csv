Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $10,000, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay more than his perceived value, especially if he needs it urgently. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation.  If Bob counters, we can always come down in price while still aiming to stay above our minimum of $15,000.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:**  We have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $15,000 if Bob refuses. This allows us to be a bit bolder in our initial offer to Bob."
