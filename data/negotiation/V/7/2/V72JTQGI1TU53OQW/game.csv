"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $950000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $920000. I'm willing to meet you at $960000, which is still a significant discount from the initial offer. This is my final compromise.",960000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go up to $955000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $960000 and $955000, which is $957500. This is my final compromise. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",957500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting stuck in a loop, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $956000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to another buyer.",956000.0,Alice,9,
