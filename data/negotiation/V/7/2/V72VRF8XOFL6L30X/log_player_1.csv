{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, but it's still within a reasonable range. It leaves room for negotiation while also showcasing your confidence in the product's value.  I've included a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $135 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $125 is a good compromise, and it's still higher than what I would get from selling to John. I've made a decent profit, and it's better to secure a sale than risk further negotiation."
