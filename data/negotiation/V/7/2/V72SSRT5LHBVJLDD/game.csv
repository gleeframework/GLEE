"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a significant drop from its true value.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $925,000?  This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Alice, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
