{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer sets a high starting point, leaving room for negotiation while ensuring you still profit significantly.  It also opens the communication with a friendly tone, potentially encouraging Bob to engage in a more positive way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin. By rejecting, you can attempt to secure a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is tempting, I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $95?  It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to stick to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's a fair price that allows you to make a decent profit while still selling the product to someone who values it."
