"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit.  Since the product is worth $150 to me, I have some room to negotiate. I'll see if Bob is willing to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to stick with my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping Bob will see that."
