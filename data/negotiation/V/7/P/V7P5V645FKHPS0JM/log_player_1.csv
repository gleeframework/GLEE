Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,100? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get the product you need and me to get a reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 8100}
```"

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  While I'd like to get a bit more, Bob is still unwilling to meet my minimum price, and we only have a few rounds left.  It's better to get a guaranteed $8,000 than to risk a lower offer or a failed negotiation."
