Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product is worth every penny. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still above your ideal price. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can push the price down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're able to negotiate a price that works for both of us. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $825,000, but only if you're willing to throw in a small bonus of $5,000 to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

While Alice's final offer is very close to your target, it still includes a $5,000 bonus.  You're only willing to pay up to $800,000, and John is offering the product at that price.  It's more beneficial to buy from John and avoid the added cost of the bonus."
