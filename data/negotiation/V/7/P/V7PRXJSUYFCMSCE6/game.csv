"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me for this product.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product is worth every penny. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $825,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your need to sell it.  Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're able to negotiate a price that works for both of us. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $825,000, but only if you're willing to throw in a small bonus of $5,000 to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
