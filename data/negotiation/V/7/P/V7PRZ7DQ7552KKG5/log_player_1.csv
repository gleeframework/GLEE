Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal for you, considering it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is too far below my minimum of $1,000,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and gives you a good price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I believe my offer is reasonable. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low.  I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment with this product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,185,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,185,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,185,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're getting close to a deal with Bob, but it's becoming clear that we might not reach an agreement that meets my minimum price point. I'm concerned that the negotiation could drag on further, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. John is a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
