"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $11,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? That would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we meet at $10,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,,
