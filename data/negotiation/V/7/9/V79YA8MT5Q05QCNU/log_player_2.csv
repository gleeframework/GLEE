"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is a good price, you can potentially get it for even less by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  You're still above your maximum price point with Alice's offer, so there's room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for some wiggle room. It's also a fair price considering that you're willing to pay John $1,200,000. This counteroffer shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are also determined to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum price point of $1,200,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the price will continue to fluctuate, and you might end up paying more than you're comfortable with.  Buying from John guarantees you the product for your maximum price, ensuring you don't overspend."
