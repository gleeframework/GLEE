Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his valuation is higher than John's.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but it's unlikely he'll go below $800,000 (your guaranteed sale price).
* **Strategic Positioning:** By positioning the offer as ""exclusive"" and highlighting the ""potential value,"" the message aims to appeal to Bob's sense of getting a good deal while still securing a significant profit for you."
