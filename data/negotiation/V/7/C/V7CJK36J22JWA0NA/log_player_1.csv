"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth more to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a little lower than the midpoint between our values to give Bob some room to negotiate and hopefully incentivize him to accept the offer. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. $9,500 is still lower than my ideal price, and I have more rounds to negotiate with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise by offering a price that's closer to my desired price but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate further.  I'm also reiterating the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $9,600 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,600 isn't my ideal price, it's closer to my desired range and represents a good deal.  Since I've already rejected a couple of offers, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. There's a chance Bob might not be willing to budge further, and selling to John would only yield $8,000.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a decent profit."
