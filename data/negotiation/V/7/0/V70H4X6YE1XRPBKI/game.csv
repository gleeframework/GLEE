"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to stay within my budget of $800,000. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $950,000 is a good offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget of $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $925,000. Can you consider this offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiations. While $925,000 is closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go down to $940,000. This is a very fair price, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal for both of us. Let's finalize this.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that $940,000 is a good offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget of $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm offering $915,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",915000.0,Bob,6,
