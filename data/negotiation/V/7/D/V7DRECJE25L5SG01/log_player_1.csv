Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant about $130. I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's my absolute limit. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While it's not ideal to accept less than $120, Bob is unlikely to go higher. Accepting his $115 offer is better than risking him walking away and only getting $120 from John."
