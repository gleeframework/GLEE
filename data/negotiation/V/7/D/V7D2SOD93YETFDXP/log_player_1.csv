"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you!  I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $175 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I could come down a little to $185.  I believe this product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll find value in it."", ""product_price"": 185}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $185 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $170 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to be fair to myself as well. How about we split the difference and say $177.50? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 177.50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $177.50. I'd be willing to pay $172 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $172. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $172
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 

At this point, Bob is very close to our acceptable price. While we could hold out for a slightly higher offer, there's a risk he might walk away in the next round. Accepting his offer of $172 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of getting stuck with the $150 offer from John."
