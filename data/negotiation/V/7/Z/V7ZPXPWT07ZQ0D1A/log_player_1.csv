{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $18,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I'm hoping it will be attractive enough for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value and is significantly higher than what John is offering. I will accept Bob's offer."
