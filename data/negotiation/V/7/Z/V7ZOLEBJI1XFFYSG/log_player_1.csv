{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Space:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, but there is room for negotiation. I want to see if I can push him higher.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $1750000. I'm willing to meet you at $1725000. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 away from my previous offer, and with only two rounds left, it's getting very close to my desired price point.
* **Time Constraint:**  With limited rounds remaining, I need to be mindful of the risk of losing the deal entirely.  
* **Acceptable Profit:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,725,000 is still a significant profit and significantly above my minimum acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

* It's better to secure a solid deal now rather than risk a potential breakdown in negotiations with only one round remaining.
* This acceptance allows me to close the deal and move on, which is preferable to risking a lower offer from Bob in the final round or potentially having to sell to John at a lower price."
