"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford $950,000 at the moment. How about we aim for a price closer to $750,000? I hope this suggestion is within your consideration.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $750,000 is simply too low and doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While $900,000 is still out of my budget, I would like to propose a price closer to $850,000. I hope this aligns better with the value you see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
