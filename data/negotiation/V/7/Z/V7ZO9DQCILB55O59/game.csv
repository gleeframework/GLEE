"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you.  My starting price is $900000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it can bring to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $850000. This price still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it can bring to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $775000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $825000. This is a significant concession on my part, but it's still a price that allows me to get a fair return on my investment.  Let's aim to close this deal in the next few rounds.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $800500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it can bring to me.",800500.0,Bob,6,
