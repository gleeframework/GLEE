"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $975,000 is simply too far off from what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from the product. Let's close this deal.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To make this work for me, I can offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
