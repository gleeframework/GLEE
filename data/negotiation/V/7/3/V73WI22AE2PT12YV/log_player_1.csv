"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer on it, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's better to try to negotiate a better price or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500, but I'm hoping we can do a bit better than that. How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to settle for that low of an amount yet. I'll try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is just not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $12,000. How about $11,000? This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd rather not go above $9,500. Can we try $10,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,250 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to settle. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally finalize this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to make a bit more of a dent in the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll pay $10,000, but I'd like you to throw in some extras, like a free accessory or a warranty extension. Can we discuss the details? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but the addition of extras feels like a step back. It's a risky move to keep negotiating with Bob, especially since I have a guaranteed sale with John for my minimum acceptable price. I'll go with the sure thing and sell to John."
