"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay no more than $15,000, and Alice is asking for $12,000. 
* **You have time to negotiate.** You have 10 rounds, so you can try to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** It's important to keep John's offer in mind, but for now, it's better to try to negotiate with Alice. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay that much and open the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable range. It shows you're serious about buying the product but are not willing to pay a premium.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** You're not going all-in with your lowest possible offer, leaving room for Alice to counter if needed.
* **Staying within your budget:** This offer is well below your maximum of $15,000, ensuring you're still saving money compared to buying from John. 

Let's see how Alice responds to your counteroffer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, $11,000 is still above your desired price range.
* **You have more room to negotiate.** With 7 rounds remaining, there's still time to push for a better deal.
* **John's offer is still a safety net.** If you can't reach an acceptable price with Alice, you have the option to buy from John.

By rejecting this offer, you continue to show Alice that you're serious about buying the product but won't overpay. This will likely lead to further negotiation and potentially a more favorable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to Alice's offer:** You've increased your counteroffer from $9,000 to $10,000, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Still below your limit:** This offer is still well within your budget of $15,000, ensuring you're getting a good deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:** You're leaving room for Alice to make a final concession if she wants to close the deal, giving you more leverage in the negotiation.

Let's see if this counteroffer convinces Alice to finally make a deal!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice is getting closer.** Alice's offer of $10,500 is now within your budget and closer to your last counteroffer of $10,000. 
* **You have limited time.** You've already used 4 rounds, and time is ticking away. There's a chance that further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but it's not guaranteed.
* **Buying from John is still a possibility.** But if you accept this offer, you'll save $4,500 compared to buying from John.

Taking into account the time constraint and the potential savings, accepting Alice's offer seems like the best choice. It's a good deal within your budget, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation failing."
