"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1,100,000. It's a steal considering its true value. Let me know if you're interested!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $800,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? It's a good compromise, and it reflects the true value of the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000. Would you consider $825,000? That seems like a reasonable final offer.",825000.0,Bob,6,
