I'm prepared to drop my price further, but I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly for the potential you'll gain from this. Let's meet in the middle at $1050000. This price would be a win-win, allowing you to secure this valuable asset while also ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  What do you think?
