Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for something worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. It's also a good starting point to test his interest level and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is more than what the product is worth to Bob, it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150. This is still a great deal considering what the product is worth. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $150. This is my minimum selling price, as it's the same amount I would get from John. I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob at this price, as it's still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $150 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $135. This is a fair price considering we're both getting a good deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $135 is still too low for me.  Since I can sell the product to John for $150,  it's best to go with the sure thing and sell to John."
