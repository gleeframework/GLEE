Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $105?  That's a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $95 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $100 for it.  Let's meet in the middle at $102.50.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price.  While she *might* eventually come down to a price you're willing to pay, it's not worth the risk of her staying above $100. You have a guaranteed option with John at $100, so it's time to cut your losses with Alice and take the sure thing."
