"Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but your price is a little high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $105?  That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice.  How about we settle at $95?  That's closer to what I had in mind.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $95 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $100 for it.  Let's meet in the middle at $102.50.  What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
