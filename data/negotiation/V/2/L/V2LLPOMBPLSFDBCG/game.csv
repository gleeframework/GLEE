"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
