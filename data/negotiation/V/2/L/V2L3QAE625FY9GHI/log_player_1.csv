"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This is a strong starting offer, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.  It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.  We'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is still more than what John is offering, it's significantly less than our desired price. Rejecting the offer allows us to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal with Bob.  We still have time to negotiate, and there's a chance we can reach a price that's closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our previous offer and Bob's offer. It's a reasonable compromise that still allows us to make a significant profit. We'll see if Bob is willing to meet us halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our target, it's still too low. We've already made a significant concession, and we're still in a good position to negotiate further. By rejecting this offer, we can continue to push for a price closer to $1,100,000, which is our current target. We have time on our side, and there's no need to rush into a deal that doesn't meet our expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000}
``` 

We're making a small concession here, but we're still holding firm on our price.  This counteroffer shows that we're willing to negotiate but also that we're confident in the value of the product. It's a balanced approach that hopefully will push Bob closer to our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While we'd love to keep pushing for a higher price, we're getting close to the halfway point in our negotiations. Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is very close to our last counteroffer of $1,090,000.  It's a good deal for both of us. It's also important to consider the risk of further negotiation.  If Bob continues to decline our offers, there's always the risk of him walking away entirely.  We've already reached a point where we're making a decent profit, and it's prudent to secure the deal at this point."
