{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but not too high that it seems unreasonable. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is more than what the product is worth to Bob, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. That's still a good deal for you, considering what it's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $92 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target.  I've already had two rounds of negotiation and don't want to risk further price reductions.  I'll sell to John for $100, which guarantees me my desired profit."
