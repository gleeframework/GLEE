{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you something incredibly valuable to both of us. I know it's worth a significant amount to you, and while I have a guaranteed buyer, I believe you're the ideal candidate to possess it. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **John as a Backstop:** Knowing John will buy for $1,000,000 provides a safety net, allowing for a higher offer to Bob.
* **""Take-it-or-leave-it"" Approach:** Creates a sense of urgency and limits Bob's ability to counter-offer, potentially leading to a quicker and more decisive response.

By starting high but leaving some room below Bob's maximum valuation, this offer aims to secure a deal that significantly benefits Alice while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
