"Bob, I'm offering you something incredibly valuable to both of us. I know it's worth a significant amount to you, and while I have a guaranteed buyer, I believe you're the ideal candidate to possess it. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. Let me know your decision.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
