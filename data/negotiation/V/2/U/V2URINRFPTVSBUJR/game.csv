"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $14,000 for the product.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,500.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for considering my previous offer, Alice. While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $11,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to make a profit, so I'll have to come back with a slightly higher offer. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,5,
