Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $15,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob starts with a significant discount, aiming to get a good deal.  $7,000 is a  strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation.  The hope is to reach a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. There's no need to risk further negotiation, especially as buying from John would cost the same.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price Bob is comfortable with."
