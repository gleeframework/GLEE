Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and positive tone encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price point leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation active.
* **Safety Net:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $10,000, so I have a safety net if Bob doesn't accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $8000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for Compromise:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob acknowledged my initial offer and expressed interest.
* **Seeking a Better Price:**  By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I can make a counter-offer closer to my desired price, potentially finding a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go all the way down to $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8,750? This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find the product a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's value, reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal even at this price.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and positive tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiations. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The price leaves room for further negotiation if necessary, but it's closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I would like to stick to my original budget of $8000. Could we perhaps reach an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is firmly sticking to his $8,000 budget, and further negotiations are unlikely to result in a price closer to my desired value.
* **Missed Minimum:** The offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Safe Alternative:** John is willing to pay $10,000, providing a guaranteed and much more favorable outcome.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob may result in further delays and wasted effort without a guarantee of a better price.

It's better to secure the higher price from John and move on, rather than risking further time and effort for a significantly lower profit."
