(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always good to try to negotiate and get a better price.  $7,500 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $6,000 is a fair price considering my maximum budget is $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $6,500, which is a good price.  There's always the chance she might come down further, but I don't want to risk her getting frustrated and walking away from the deal."
