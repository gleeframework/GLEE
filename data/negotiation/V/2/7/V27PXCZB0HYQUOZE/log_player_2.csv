"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better deal than John's offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's room for improvement since Alice values the product at $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a living, too! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $920,000 to be happy. How about we meet at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,000,000 and leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice becoming unwilling to sell or even raising her price.  Accepting the offer ensures a successful purchase at a price that is beneficial to both parties."
