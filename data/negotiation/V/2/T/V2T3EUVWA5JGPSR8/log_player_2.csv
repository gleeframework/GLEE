Round 3

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here. $12,500 is my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with another seller."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $13,000. It's the lowest price I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for a lower price, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting this offer gets me the product for a price lower than my initial limit, which is a good outcome."
