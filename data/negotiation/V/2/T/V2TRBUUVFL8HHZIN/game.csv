"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $950,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to offer $925,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach a deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. Let's see if we can finalize the sale at this price.",975000.0,Alice,7,
