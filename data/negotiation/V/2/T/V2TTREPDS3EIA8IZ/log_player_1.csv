"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** $1,750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, so I have some buffer in case Bob counter-offers.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone in my message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **More negotiation needed:**  I believe there's still room for a deal, especially since Bob expressed interest in the product. I'll counter-offer in the next round.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John open as a safety net, but I'm not ready to give up on a deal with Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering within range:**  My counter-offer of $1,600,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing compromise:** I'm using language like ""find a middle ground"" to emphasize that I'm open to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, $1,400,000 is still below my floor of $1,500,000.
* **More room for negotiation:** I'm confident that Bob is genuinely interested in the product and I can still push for a better deal.
* **Selling to John is still a safety net:** If Bob's counteroffers continue to be too low, I'm willing to sell to John, but I'm not giving up on the negotiation with Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the value of the product for you, while also ensuring I meet my minimum requirements. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, showing I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Urgency:**  Using phrases like ""Let's close this deal!"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We've been through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.
* **Time to Move On:**  I don't want to risk further rounds where Bob might continue to lowball me.  I'm confident I can get a better price from John.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
