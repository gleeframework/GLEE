"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really like it. I'm asking for $110, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. 
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, showing flexibility. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open for further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I can only go up to $80 for this product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting it would be a huge loss.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Even though Bob's offer is unacceptable, he's still interested in the product.  There's room for negotiation in the remaining rounds.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While I'm open to finding a deal with Bob, I know I can always sell to John for $120, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation, I can potentially get a better price or, if unsuccessful, still have the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Finding a middle ground:** I'm explicitly inviting Bob to find a compromise, which can encourage him to increase his offer.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring that I don't lose money on this deal.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive and positions me to potentially secure a better price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. $100 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and meet at $90? I'm serious about buying this, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While it's tempting to accept, selling to John would still yield a higher profit.
* **Negotiation room:**  Bob is clearly serious about buying and is willing to increase his offer. There's still room for improvement.
* **Seeking a better price:** I'm confident that I can negotiate a price closer to my desired range in the remaining rounds.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore further negotiation and try to secure a higher price while keeping John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  $90 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I need to make a bit more on this.  How about $95? I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:** I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, showing that I'm not just accepting his every offer.
* **Emphasizing a good deal:** I'm framing my offer as a win-win, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Staying above minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to my desired price while keeping the negotiation open. I'm confident that with a few more rounds, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
