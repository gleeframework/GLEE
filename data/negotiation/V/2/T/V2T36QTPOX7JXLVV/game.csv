"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $120. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we meet at $160? It's a great compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $130.  If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to go with another offer.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $130, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we meet at $145? It's a good compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
