"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I can't go as low as $10,500, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
