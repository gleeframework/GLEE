Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. Considering the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product. This is my maximum price, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, $1,000,000 is still my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob."
