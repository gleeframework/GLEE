This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer it at this price again. What do you think?

**Explanation:**

While buying from John would cost more, Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,500,000 and allows him to save $300,000 compared to John's price."
