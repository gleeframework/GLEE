Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's unique value to Bob helps justify the high price tag. 

**Why not ask for the full $1,200,000?**

While tempting, it leaves no room for negotiation and might make Bob feel like he's getting a bad deal, potentially leading him to walk away."
