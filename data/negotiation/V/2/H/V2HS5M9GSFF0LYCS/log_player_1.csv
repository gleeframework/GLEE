Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible without scaring him off. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially earning you even more. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed to sell it to John for $120, ensuring you don't lose out."
