"Hello Alice, thank you for reaching out. I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price. Considering the market value and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750000 for the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $820000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my initial proposal. Given the current market conditions and the value of the product, I am willing to pay no more than $760000. Let me know if this is a feasible offer for you.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $760000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a fair price for the product is $810000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make, but I need to be confident that it's a price you're comfortable with. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with an offer of $770000. This is the highest amount I can realistically afford without compromising my financial stability. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us.",770000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $770000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're close to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $795000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope it's something you can work with.",795000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.
