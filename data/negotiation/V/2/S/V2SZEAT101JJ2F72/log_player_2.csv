# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible and Alice's offer is above his target price.  It's worth negotiating further."

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. Even though Alice's offer is closer to his target, he can likely get it for less by continuing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $11,200. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target price and he's already gone through several rounds of negotiation. At this point, it's better for Bob to take the sure thing and buy from John for $10,000.  There's no guarantee Alice will accept any further counteroffers, and he could end up paying more than he's willing to."
