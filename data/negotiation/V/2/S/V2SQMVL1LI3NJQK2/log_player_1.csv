Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it is:

* **Higher than Bob's value:** $140 is more than $120, giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **Lower than your minimum:** $140 is less than your minimum of $150, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Reasonable:**  It's a fair starting point for negotiation.

I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is still above Bob's value of $120 and would result in a profit, it's closer to my minimum of $150 than I'd like. I'm going to try to push for a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $130 is a tempting offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $135? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $130. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $132 is getting very close to my minimum of $150. It's also clear that he's not willing to go higher, so it's probably in my best interest to accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
