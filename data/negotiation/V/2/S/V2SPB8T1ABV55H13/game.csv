"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product!  It's valued at $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a significant price point, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $700,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to sell the product for $850,000. This still allows you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price given the value of this unique product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $750,000?  I believe that's a fair offer that benefits both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
