"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120 maximum.
* Alice's first offer is $110, which is still above your maximum value.
* There are 10 rounds, giving you ample opportunity to negotiate a better price. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I want to start by offering a price that is closer to Alice's value of $100, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* Offering $105 shows that I am serious about buying the product, but I am also trying to get a good deal.
* This counteroffer is a fair starting point, and I am confident that we can reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now $108, which is still a bit higher than my ideal price, but it's within my maximum value of $120. 
* Accepting the offer secures the product at a decent price. 
* While there are still rounds left, I don't want to risk Alice rejecting my counteroffer again, and possibly ending up paying more from John. 
*  It's better to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
