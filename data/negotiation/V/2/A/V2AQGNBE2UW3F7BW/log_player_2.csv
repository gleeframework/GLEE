"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what you're willing to pay and more than what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $12,500 is less than $15,000.
* **It's within your budget:**  $12,500 is less than your maximum of $15,000. 

While you could potentially try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting her offer guarantees you a good deal without the risk of losing the product to another buyer."
