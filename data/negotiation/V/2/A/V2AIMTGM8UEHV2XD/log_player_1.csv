# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose an offer of $1200000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not desperate enough to sell at this price point."
