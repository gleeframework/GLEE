"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than $150, I'm aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer gives me a chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $140 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my preferred price.  $135 is still within my budget and represents a good deal, considering I could buy from John for $150. There's a chance I could get it lower, but it's not worth risking losing the deal completely."
