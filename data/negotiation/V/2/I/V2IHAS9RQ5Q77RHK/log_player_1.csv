"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. It's important to start high to maximize my potential profit, but also to understand that Bob's value for the product is unknown."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counter-offer in the next round.  There's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm countering with a price of $1,000,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. It also gives me room to lower the price further if necessary in subsequent rounds."
