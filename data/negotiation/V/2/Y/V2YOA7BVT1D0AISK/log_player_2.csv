{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice since you can potentially save some money.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive counteroffer of $10,000.  This is significantly lower than Alice's offer and will likely make her think about negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is still too high. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

I'm increasing my offer again, but only by a small amount. I want to show Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not going to overpay."

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a better price.  Let's see if I can squeeze out another few hundred dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to offer $12,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and should hopefully be more appealing to Alice. I'm starting to feel the pressure with the number of rounds remaining, but I'm determined to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

With only one round left, it's not likely I'll get a much better offer from Alice.  It's better to take the safe option and buy from John for $15,000. I still save $1,000 compared to Alice's last offer."
