"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product for a one-time price of $20,000. I believe it's a steal at this price, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. It makes no sense to accept a price higher than your valuation and what another seller offers."
