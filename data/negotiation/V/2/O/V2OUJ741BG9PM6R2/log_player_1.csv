Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Staying Above Bob's Value:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, offering it at or below that price guarantees we'll lose potential profit.  
* **Below John's Offer:** Offering it at $140 is still a better deal for Bob than John's guaranteed $150 purchase, making it more tempting. 

This approach aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
