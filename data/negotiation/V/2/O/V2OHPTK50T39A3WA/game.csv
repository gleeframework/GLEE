,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, I'm really interested but $90 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $75? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $82.50 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $80.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets me the product I want.",80.0,Bob,4,
