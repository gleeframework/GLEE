Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price that reflects its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a high price close to your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) sets an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're more likely to secure a price closer to your desired outcome.
* **Slight Discount:** Offering a small discount (in this case, $1) makes the offer psychologically more appealing than a flat $12,000. It creates a sense of getting a deal, even though the price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing your potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and going with John."
