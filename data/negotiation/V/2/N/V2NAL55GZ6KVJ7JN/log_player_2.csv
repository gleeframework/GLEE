"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You should definitely try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price ($120) but still within a reasonable range to begin negotiations.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  By offering $60, we have space to increase our offer if Alice completely rejects it. Our goal is to stay well below $80 (the price John offers).
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is friendly and explains our budget constraints while expressing continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $60 is quite low.  Could you do $100? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  Alice's counteroffer of $100 is still above your $80 maximum budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While she says it's the ""lowest she can go,"" there's usually some flexibility in negotiations. You can try a counteroffer closer to your budget. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** You always have the option to go with John's offer of $80 if you can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you considering my budget, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's the most I can offer for this product."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Offer:** We're offering Alice the exact price we can get from John. This gives her a strong incentive to accept, as she'd otherwise lose the sale.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message conveys that this is our final offer while maintaining a polite and respectful tone.
* **Strategic Timing:** By offering our maximum now, we increase the pressure on Alice to accept and avoid further back-and-forth that might not result in a better deal."
