{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $1,400,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  You have a clear goal to save money, and rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating.
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is attractive, you should explore if you can get a better price from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my maximum budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000 to meet you halfway.  This price still gives me a decent profit, and I believe it's fair considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $1,350,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  You have more room to negotiate, and rejecting the offer allows you to continue lowering the price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Alice fail, you have a guaranteed way to acquire the product at a lower price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $1300000 is closer to where I need to be, it's still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more, at $1325000. This is a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. Let's make it happen!
