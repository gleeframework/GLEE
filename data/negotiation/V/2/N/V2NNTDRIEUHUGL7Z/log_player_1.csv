"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a decent profit for Alice.  It's also a bit higher than Bob's estimated value, giving him some wiggle room for a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my maximum budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $1250000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice needs to try to get a price closer to her minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 would be a significant loss for Alice. While selling to John would guarantee her desired price, it's still worthwhile to continue negotiations with Bob. There are still 8 rounds left, and Alice can potentially get a better price from Bob than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to meet you halfway.  This price still gives me a decent profit, and I believe it's fair considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1300000, which is closer to my maximum and represents a significant step towards your desired price.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to Alice's desired price, it's still not high enough. She's already made significant concessions and has a strong backup option with John. By rejecting this offer, Alice can continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $1,300,000 is closer to where I need to be, it's still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more, at $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal, but $1325000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1300000 one last time. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. If you accept, we can finalize the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stated this is his final offer, and Alice has already made significant concessions.  With only 4 rounds left, it is unlikely that she will be able to get a price closer to her target.  It is more advantageous for Alice to accept John's offer of $1,500,000 and guarantee her desired profit.  While continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a higher price, it also carries the risk of not closing the deal and losing out on a guaranteed sale."
