"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to only consider offers below $1400000. I would like to propose a counteroffer at $1350000.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1350000. I'm willing to come down to $1300000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1280000.",1280000.0,Alice,3,
