"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your maximum price. It makes sense to reject and counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $200 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is quite low for what I can offer. How about we meet in the middle at $175? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $175 is still above your limit of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target."
