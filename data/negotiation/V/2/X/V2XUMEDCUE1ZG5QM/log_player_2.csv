"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's always best to start by rejecting an initial offer that's too high and try to negotiate a better price.  You have the option of buying from John, so you're not in a rush to accept."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. It's still a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You're still better off buying from John, so you should reject her offer and continue negotiating."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite willing to meet you at $1000000, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm thinking of $1050000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above your maximum budget.  You've already established a strong negotiation position by consistently offering $1,000,000.  It's unlikely Alice will go lower, and you're better off buying from John for $1,000,000 to guarantee a purchase within your budget."
