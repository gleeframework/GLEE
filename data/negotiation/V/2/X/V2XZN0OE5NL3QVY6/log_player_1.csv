Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, $850,000 is a good deal and better than the guaranteed $800,000 from John. There's no guarantee Bob will come up higher, and continued negotiation could lead to a stalemate or him backing out entirely."
