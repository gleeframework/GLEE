"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I receive a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm offering $1,000,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and shows my commitment to making this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us, but I'm not willing to drop below $1,000,000. This is my final offer. I'm confident you'll see the immense value this product offers and agree to this price. If not, I'll be moving on to another buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
