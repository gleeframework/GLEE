# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than John's price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of $800,000. This indicates there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, Bob signals that he's looking for a better deal and might incentivize Alice to lower her price closer to her own valuation."
