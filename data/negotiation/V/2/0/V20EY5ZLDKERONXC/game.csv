"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it, since that's what it's worth to me.  Let me know if you're interested in that.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $180 is my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $150. This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll get great value from it.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $150 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $120,  but I really don't want to go higher than that.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle on $135? That's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really close to my limit.  $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick to my offer of $120.  If we can't agree on that, I may have to look at other options.",120.0,Bob,6,
