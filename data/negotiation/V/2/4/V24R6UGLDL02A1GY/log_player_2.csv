# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $11,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is a good price considering your maximum is $12,000.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more to John."
