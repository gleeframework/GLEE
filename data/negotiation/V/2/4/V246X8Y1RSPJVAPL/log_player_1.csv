"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to close the deal, $80 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $80 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. That's a good price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a compromise price that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above $80, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price,  $85 is still below it. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also trying to maximize my profit. I'm hoping Bob will see that $95 is a good deal for him too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $95. I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $87.5 is still below it. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. I'm still hopeful that we can reach an agreement that's fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $87.50 isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $92.50. This is a fair compromise that's closer to both of our desired prices.  Let's finalize this deal - how about it?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to maximize my profit. With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $87.50 is a fair price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left and Bob refusing to budge, I'm running out of time. Even though I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I'm not willing to settle for a price below my minimum acceptable price.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $120. It's a guaranteed sale and ensures I get the value I'm looking for."
