,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $80 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. That's a good price for both of us. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above $80, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal, what do you say?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $95. I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.,87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $87.50 isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $92.50. This is a fair compromise that's closer to both of our desired prices.  Let's finalize this deal - how about it?",92.5,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $87.50 is a fair price. Can you meet me at that price?",87.5,Bob,8,
