"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to start high to maximize my potential profit. I also want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product at all."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.  However, I also don't want to completely walk away from the deal yet, as I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $1,500,000, my absolute minimum.  At this point, I'm willing to accept this price because it meets my minimum requirement and I believe Bob is getting closer to my desired range. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John at this price, so I'm not taking a significant risk by offering this final compromise."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob as he's clearly unwilling to meet my price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I get my minimum desired value."
