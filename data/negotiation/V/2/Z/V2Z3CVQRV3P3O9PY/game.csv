"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to me.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still slightly higher than my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's split the difference -  I'm prepared to pay $862,500 for the product. This is a fair price that represents a significant savings for you and is within my financial limitations.",862500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. After re-evaluating the market and considering your latest offer, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $880,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",880000.0,Alice,5,
