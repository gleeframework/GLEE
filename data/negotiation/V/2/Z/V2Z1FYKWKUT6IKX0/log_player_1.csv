Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for negotiation and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob rejects, I can then assess if his counteroffer is reasonable and adjust my price accordingly.  If it's too low, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be acceptable to him. If he rejects again, I'll have to decide whether to accept his offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my liking.  Although I am willing to negotiate, I am not comfortable dropping below my minimum. John's offer is a safer option, ensuring I get my minimum and avoid further negotiation."
