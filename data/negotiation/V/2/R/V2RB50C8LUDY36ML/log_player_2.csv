"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a significant value proposition, as it's well below what it's worth to you.  I understand you value it at $1,500,000, so this gives you a substantial advantage. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details.  If not, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
