Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I believe it's a great deal and I'm hoping you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, I want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $110 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80), but it's still attractive compared to my fallback option.
* **Potential for Agreement:** This price gives Bob a chance to get the product while allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum."
